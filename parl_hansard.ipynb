       "   'content': '<p>1 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Transport whether taxi drivers aged 65 and above who have taken their medical assessments for their personal driving licence may be exempted from retaking the same tests for their vocational licence within the same year.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tThe Senior Minister of State for Transport (Dr Janil Puthucheary) (for the Minister for Transport)</strong>: Mr Speaker,&nbsp;Traffic Police require all drivers aged 65 and above to pass a medical examination to certify their fitness to drive a private car once every three years, in order to retain their Class 3 personal driving licences. Among these older drivers who wish to drive a taxi, LTA requires them to also pass a medical examination with additional occupation-related health checks to certify their fitness to renew their Taxi Driver Vocational Licences (TDVL). We subject taxi drivers to more stringent medical assessment as they clock a much higher mileage than other motorists. This is to protect the commuting public.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;</span>LTA is working with the Traffic Police to align the two medical assessment processes. Before the end of this year, taxi drivers who have passed their TDVL medical assessments should be able to use them to renew their Class 3 personal driving licences.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>: Thank you, Sir. I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State. I am very happy to hear that these will be aligned. It will definitely cost less to our residents. I have two supplementary questions.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">According to my resident, for Class 4 and 5, Traffic Police\\'s enhanced Heavy Vehicle Proficiency Test fee is about $450. LTA\\'s enhanced Taxi Driver\\'s Vocational Licence test is $136. Both require separate medical examinations for both licence-holders aged 69 to 74 years. Residents feel that this is very expensive, very heavy on them. I welcome the alignment and I would also like to urge that the test fee can be further reduced. Four hundred fifty dollars is very high to many of them.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The second question is, at this difficult period of the COVID-19 crisis, would the Ministry work with taxi companies to work on rental reduction? Many of them have given feedback that their incomes have been reduced by as much as 50%.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Mr Speaker, for the test fees, we are continually looking at the process of how we do these medical assessments. We will take the test fees into consideration. I thank the Member for her suggestion. We will have a look at this.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In terms of the broader issue of the taxi operators, we have announced some measures to help the taxi industry&nbsp;– some are directed at the drivers and some are directed at the operators. We will continue to work closely with the association, in line with the tripartite model, to look and see what is the effectiveness of the interventions we put in place and to see whether or not further interventions are necessary.</p>',\n",

       "   'subTitle': None,\n",
       "   'sectionType': 'OA',\n",
       "   'content': '<p>2 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past year, how many people have been penalised for jaywalking; (b) how does the Ministry monitor areas where jaywalking is prevalent; (c) how many fatal traffic accidents were caused by jaywalking in the past three years; (d) whether the Ministry plans to implement additional measures to reduce the danger of fatal traffic accidents to the elderly who jaywalk; and (e) whether there is a need to review the current penalties to deter jaywalking.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Home Affairs)</strong>:&nbsp;In 2019, Traffic Police (TP) detected about 2,500 jaywalking violations. From 2017 to 2019, there were 59 fatal traffic accidents involving jaywalkers. Elderly jaywalkers were involved in about 68% of them.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In recent years, TP have stepped up its engagement of elderly pedestrians. In 2019, TP organised the Road Safety Carnival themed \"Be Seen, Be Safe\" for more than 1,000 senior citizens, to raise awareness on the importance of using designated pedestrian crossings and how to cross roads safely. This year, TP will be working with the Lion Befrienders Service Association and NTUC Health Co-operative Limited to train staff and volunteers to become Road Safety Champions to engage senior citizens on road safety.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">To further improve safety for elderly pedestrians, LTA has implemented Silver Zones at locations with a high proportion of senior residents, and where there have been accidents involving seniors. Silver Zones have senior-friendly road safety features, such as rest points for pedestrians along road dividers and signs to alert motorists of the presence of elderly pedestrians. LTA plans to increase the number of Silver Zones from 17 in 2019 to 50 by 2023.</p><p>TP regularly conducts enforcement operations at accident-prone locations and jaywalking hot-spots. Under the Road Traffic Act, it is an offence for pedestrians to fail to cross at a pedestrian crossing. The composition sum for this offence was raised from $20 to $50 on 1 April 2019. We will monitor the situation and consider further measures if necessary.</p><p><strong>\\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>: I do not have five supplementary questions, but I have two. When I first came to Singapore, many of my cousins told me, \"Don\\'t jaywalk. You have to cross by following traffic rules. Otherwise, Police will catch you and will fine you.\" And therefore, I am very law-abiding. But today, I cannot say the same thing to the visitors to Singapore because you can see jaywalkers everywhere. It is so common. To many of us, we feel that there is no enforcement or very little enforcement. Will Ministry step up enforcement and whether it will use technology, for example, CCTV, facial recognition, especially at those locations that have had fatal accidents? The Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned just now 59 fatal accidents involving jaywalkers. That is very many.</p><p>The second question is, I also have residents who give feedback that increasingly, that when pedestrians cross the roads, their eyes are glued to the phone. Currently, we know that this is not enforceable. I would like to ask whether this is dangerous and if there is any action to be taken.</p><p><strong>\\tMs Sun Xueling</strong>: I thank the Member for her follow-up questions. As I had mentioned in my earlier reply, definitely, more education, more outreach will be conducted by TP. I have spoken about the \"Be Seen, Be Safe\" campaign. We will also be working with more community outreach organisations such as Lion Befrienders and NTUC Health Co-operative. The Member mentioned that, anecdotally, she sees on the roads is that there are more and more jaywalkers. We are aligned in wanting to deter pedestrians from jaywalking because it definitely causes a danger to themselves. So, we have to find effective ways of reaching out to them to tell them that this is dangerous for them. They can cause harm to themselves; they can also cause harm to motorists, who might have to suddenly swerve to avoid them and they might get into accidents.&nbsp;So, definitely, we are aligned in that we need to conduct more education and outreach efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>On enforcement, I hear what the Member has said about increasing enforcement. When there is feedback about jaywalking hot-spots, TP would intensify their operations as and when they hear feedback from the ground regarding this. On the use of CCTV and technological means, for these to be effective, as the Member mentioned, there needs to be the use of facial recognition technology. There is some feedback from the ground that the use of such technology can be quite invasive. So, while we are definitely considering it, I think we also have to be mindful that too much use of such technology may cause discomfort on the ground as well. Dr Yaacob in his Budget debate speech also talked about whether or not there needs to be a community conversation around the use of technology in public spaces.</p><p>We will bear in mind what the Member has mentioned and continuously look at better ways to conduct enforcement as well as education outreach efforts.</p><p>The Member\\'s second question was&nbsp;—</p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>: Pedestrians crossing the road and their eyes are glued to their mobile phones.</p><p><strong>\\tMs Sun Xueling</strong>: Yes. So, that would be part and parcel of our education outreach efforts. It is not just about using your mobile phone when crossing the road. Even using your mobile phone while going up an escalator can be dangerous. When we reach out to pedestrians, especially when they are on the roads, and in this case, we are talking about elderly pedestrians, then, all the more, they need to be mindful of their surroundings. Having their eyes glued to the mobile phone is definitely a dangerous thing to do when they are crossing the road.</p>',\n",

       "   'sectionType': 'OA',\n",
       "   'content': '<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">3 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider increasing the period during which Government-Paid Paternity Leave may be consumed from within 12 months of childbirth to within 24 months of childbirth.</p><p><strong>\\tThe Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Prime Minister)</strong>: Mr Speaker,&nbsp;fathers play an important role in their children\\'s care and development. For this reason, we have progressively increased parental leave provisions to support fathers in caring for their children. Today, fathers can tap on up to eight weeks of leave in the year after their child\\'s birth, including two weeks of paternity leave and four weeks of shared parental leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to maternity leave, paternity leave should be consumed within 12 months of childbirth, as it is meant to support working fathers in caring for their infants when they are younger and in need of more care. For this reason, we have no plans to extend it to 24 months of childbirth. This is also in line with international practice where parents are typically required to consume maternity and paternity leave within a few months or up to a year after the child\\'s birth. This is the practice in many countries such as Denmark, United Kingdom and South Korea.</p><p>&nbsp;After the child turns one, parents can continue to tap on other forms of leave support. This includes six days of unpaid infant care leave per parent per year until the child turns two, on top of six days of paid childcare leave, which each parent can take annually until the child turns seven. Together with tripartite partners, we also encourage employers to provide up to four weeks of unpaid leave per year if their employees have children below two years old who need more care, for example, due to medical conditions. This is a provision under the Tripartite Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, which I must thank the Member Mr Louis Ng for helping to bring about.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;Beyond leave provisions, the Government will continue to work with employers to better support parents in managing their work and family responsibilities. This includes promoting the adoption of flexible work arrangements and encouraging more family-friendly practices at workplaces.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Ng.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: Thank you, Sir. I thank the Minister for the reply. I think what was shocking for me was that in 2018, 65% of fathers in Singapore did not even take one day of paternity leave. I am just wondering whether the Ministry is looking into this further, whether we are looking at Denmark, UK and South Korea&nbsp;– the three countries that the Minister mentioned&nbsp;– what is the take-up rates of paternity leave there and what are they doing that can help increase our take-up of paternity leave.</p><p>The second clarification is a suggestion, actually. I understand the default arrangement now is that the fathers have to take their paternity leave within 16 weeks of child birth and he has to take it in a two-week continuous block. For any other arrangement, they would need the employers\\' consent. I am just wondering whether we can make the default arrangement that the fathers can take it anytime within the 12 months of child birth and they do not need to take it in a continuous block. Maybe then, there will be an increase in the number of fathers taking up the paternity leave.</p><p><strong>\\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. The figure of 65%, if I recall correctly, is within a certain period of reporting. What happens is that you need the employers to have submitted the claims in order for the true picture to emerge. So, usually, fathers have one year after the child\\'s birth to take leave and employers have three months after the fathers take leave to submit the claims. So, I would take that 65% in context.</p><p>The Member asked about the experience in other countries. It is actually very interesting.&nbsp;I still recall visiting Denmark, one of the Nordic countries that is very well-known for its family-friendly policies as well as, overall, very strong support for parenthood. If my memory serves me right, I was myself, quite surprised that their paternity leave utilisation was just about 70%, not higher than that. So, I asked my counterpart to explain to me why this was so. I recall quite distinctly being told that even in a country like Denmark, there are certain sectors, where it is just not considered at the workplace to be very acceptable for the man to go on paternity leave. That is the reason why, even for them, the paternity leave is not closer to 100%.&nbsp;</p><p>It is quite the case for also a country like South Korea. Paternity leave utilisation is around 3%, very low.</p><p>What these countries experiences suggest to us is that workplace norms, how accepting the co-workers are and also the employers are, for paternity leave utilisation, that is still something that is being worked on.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Singapore context, actually we have been making very good progress. Today, the paternity leave utilisation is about 53%, that is not too bad. Within the public sector, the utilisation rate is even higher, about 84%. So, within the public sector, the utilisation already surpasses some of the Nordic countries.</p><p>What can we do? I think a change of norms, which is something I see happening to a very large extent. You see very many more fathers are involved in the raising of their children. Can we encourage employers to be even more supportive? I think the answer is yes.</p><p>If I may just make an observation. This is, I think the fifth time you have asked the question about paternity leave in as many months. So, we are happy to answer your slightly different questions. I hope that you are equally happy with our slightly different answers. During the COS, where we get a chance to deal with marriage and parenthood in a more comprehensive manner, I think we can have a fuller exchange. So, I seek the Member\\'s indulgence for us to take the rest of your questions together in the COS.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\\tMr Speaker</strong>: Order. End of question time.</p>',\n",

(proc text)]</p><p>[(proc text) Question again proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>12.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the budget and I applaud what is being done for Singaporeans in this COVID-19 situation. I dedicate my speech today to two important issues close to my heart, care-giving and ending sexual violence. It is my hope in 2020 that we dedicate more attention to addressing these critical issues and make greater strides towards a more inclusive society and a safer society for all.</p><p>Today, my parents are 65. They lead active lives, but ten years down the road, their lives could possibly be very different as they enter their golden years. As a child to my ageing parents, the prospect of assuming some care-giving responsibilities sometime in the near future weighs on my mind. I am hardly alone in this. Around me,&nbsp;peers of my age share similar concerns. The old age dependency ratio in Singapore has been declining over the decades. In 1990, it was 10.5 younger person to an elderly person. In 2019, the ratio has halved to 4.5. As our loved ones grow older, there are fewer of us to share the labour and responsibilities of care-giving with.</p><p>How will we continue to lead the lives we have when we potentially also have to be care-givers? Would our work schedules allow us to juggle work and care? Would we be able to afford hiring professional help? What other options are there for our parents to age with dignity?</p><p>For women, the pressures are felt even more acutely as societal norms continue to promote care-giving as women\\'s responsibility. A 2011 national survey on care-giving for elderly individuals, those above 75 years old, requiring help with at least one activity of daily living found that 97.9% of all informal care-givers in Singapore are immediate family members, with more of them being female and between 45 and 59 years old. The female care-givers are also usually wives or adult daughters of the care recipient.</p><p>The pressure on women to be care-givers has a great impact on their ability to engage in paid work. In 2018, over 280,000 women were outside the labour force primarily because of care-giving to relatives or family members apart from children. In comparison, just over 15,000 men cited the same reason for being outside the labour force. The compromises that women make to their work lives negatively impacts their financial security. According to CPF statistics, about four in 10 active CPF members who turned 55 in 2017 did not meet the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) of $83,000 in their Retirement Accounts.</p><p>Among them, women have more difficulty meeting the BRS. Similarly, a recent study shows that female family care-givers to older persons experienced a change in work situation because of care-giving, suffering a 63% loss in income on average which translated into an average annual loss of more than $50,000.</p><p>Ask any care-giver around you and you will know that it demands a great deal of energy, time, resources and attention. You could find yourself waking up several times throughout the night to attend to your loved ones\\' needs, or having to spend hours persuading them to take their medication, or even straining your back trying to physically move them. For the hundreds of thousands of care-givers out there, stress, burnout and feelings of resentment may not be uncommon. Not only do they have to contend with the physical stress of care-giving, they are also struggling to balance the demands of paid work and dealing with care-related expenses which they are also now responsible for.</p><p>When you become a care-giver, it very often becomes the central identity and the focal point of your life, and you find that the other aspects of your life: your job, your friends, your hobbies, your leisure time, have to accommodate care-giving, not the other way around.</p><p>How can we better redistribute care-giving responsibilities between men and women, but also between the family, community and state? How can we as a society ensure that care-givers are not compromising on their own health and financial security as they carry out this often invisible and thankless work?</p><p>Over the years, the Government has introduced numerous policies to support family care-givers, including most recently the Caregiver Support Action Plan. Many of these initiatives, such as the subsidies for long-term care services and foreign domestic worker levy, have no doubt been of tremendous help to those who benefited from them. However, I believe that our efforts can still be strengthened and would call for even bolder moves.</p><p>To start, we need up-to-date and more robust data on care-givers in Singapore. The last national survey on informal care-giving was conducted almost a decade ago. There should be regular systematic tracking of the number of care-givers in order to understand the scale of challenges they are facing.</p><p>Next, I highlight two workplace policy suggestions that have been raised by various experts and civil society organisations like the Singapore Alliance of Women in Ageing.</p><p>Workplaces need to accommodate care, not the other way around when we recognise and accept the fact that all workers, including those who are employers, will likely find themselves with care-giving responsibilities at some point in their lives. Can we consider legislating the right for employees to request for Flexible Work Arrangements (FWA)? Such legislation has already been successfully introduced in the UK, New Zealand, Canada and Australia.</p><p>Research shows that current utilisation of flexible work arrangements is low due to bias by middle management and requirements for \"facetime\" at the office for performance appraisal, bias against part-timers and reluctance to change the status quo. Without equal mandated access, those most in need, like care-givers, are likely to be denied access to FWA and will have no choice but to exit the workforce.</p><p>Second, childcare leave should be converted to family care leave so that all workers have the option to utilise it for their dependents. Those with children and other older dependents should be given a longer quantum of leave. Unpaid care-giving leave is not sufficient for care-givers as they must use up their own personal and medical leave, leading to care-giver burnout and health problems. Currently, family leave that allows for care-giving of relatives is voluntary, unlike childcare leave that is mandated at six days paid per parent for Singapore Citizens.</p><p>In 2018, only 20% of companies offered some type of paid family care leave. Finally, we need to continue expanding care options. Whether it is through hiring a professional homecare nurse, going to a daycare centre or living in a retirement home. We need to make these options affordable for families. According to a local study, they found that lower, middle-income households would spend between 23% and 59% of their household income on long-term care services after subsidies. The figures are 24% to 63% for upper middle income households. I hope the Government can review the subsidies system to ensure that the cost of these services are not prohibitively high to families, including middle income ones.</p><p>On to the next topic, having just graduated from SMU in the recent years, I am particularly concerned about the recent spate in campus sexual violence cases as well as how the use of technology has enabled new forms of sexual violence to be committed. This next part of my speech would focus on how we can better address these two forms of violence. But first, I would stress the importance that sex education plays in ending violence against women.</p><p>Efforts to address sexual violence are usually focused on legislation, punishment and remedying the effects for survivors. However, there is a crucial need to address social norms and attitudes which enable sexual violence. The prevalence of sexual violence, committed overwhelmingly by men against women, reveals an ugly truth about the way society views women: that women are not human. Sexual violence is fundamentally rooted in the idea that women are objects, devoid of agency, rights and feelings, that women exist for men\\'s pleasure, that women are not equal to men.</p><p>Education on consent, sexual violence, gender equality, is therefore absolutely necessary to transform society\\'s understanding and views for the better. In this vein, I believe that the sexuality education children and young persons receive in schools is a powerful tool to catalyse change from young.</p><p>Is the current sexuality education curriculum reflective of and relatable to young people\\'s experiences with sex, sexuality and gender-based violence today? Are students themselves consulted to find what they need and want to learn from sexuality education? What needs and gaps in knowledge do they have that are not being met by the curriculum?</p><p>According to the United Nations, comprehensive sexuality education, apart from providing scientifically accurate information about sexual and reproductive health, also importantly includes discussion about gender roles, human rights, gender equality and threats such as discrimination and sexual violence. Our sexuality education syllabus should be inclusive and explicitly address these topics.</p><p>I now turn my attention to campus sexual violence. News headlines have recently been dominated by sexual offences committed within education institutions. From the Academic Year 2015/2016 to 2017/2018, 56 cases of sexual misconduct were reported to Autonomous Universities in Singapore and 37 of these cases were reported to the Police. Given the stigma around sexual violence, it is reasonable to assume that many more of such cases go unreported.</p><p>Students have a right to feel safe in schools. In 2016, it was asked if MOE would formulate guidelines and provide anti-harassment training to staff in tertiary institutions in Singapore, based on the recommendations of the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment. Then, they responded that institution-specific codes of conduct were already in place to prevent harassment on campuses across the nation.</p><p>However, in the wake of Monica Baey\\'s brave sharing last year, it has become apparent that relying on individual institutions to develop their own policies and protocols is often inadequate. There is an uneven level of protection across institutions, with differing definitions of what constitutes harassment, and varying complaint, investigation and disciplinary processes. This means that whether students get their case investigated, how it will be investigated and what the outcome may be, and what support they receive as victims would differ, depending on where they go to school. This should not be the case. Violence is violence, and should be dealt with in the same way, regardless of institution setting.</p><p>Therefore, I believe the way forward is for the development of a national code or guideline addressing campus sexual violence that all education institutions can adopt. This code should set out the duties of the schools to ensure zero tolerance of sexual harassment, provide adequate victim-care support and set out standards and principles for investigating and managing complaints.</p><p>Another worrying trend is the rise of sexual violence involving the use of technology, such as social media, spy-cameras and mobile recording devices. According to AWARE, the number of technology-facilitated sexual violence cases they have seen had increased threefold in the last three years. In 2018, they saw 124 cases, more than half of which involved sexual images of the survivors that were non-consensually shared, obtained or created.</p><p>The effects of technology-facilitated sexual violence on the survivor can be just as traumatic as other forms of sexual violence. Having one’s privacy being invaded and intimate images of themselves shared publicly without consent renders a distressing sense of helplessness. Even with the successful conviction of the perpetrator, the traumatic effects of having one’s intimate images and recordings still circulating in the public domain will still be felt by survivors. I hope that survivors of such offences can be better protected.</p><p>Perhaps mechanisms could be set up for the swift removal of non-consensually shared intimate materials, even before conviction. In Australia, complaints about one’s intimate recording being shared non-consensually can be made to the eSafety Commissioner online. The Commissioner is then empowered to issue removal notices for the end-user or service provider to remove the materials in question within 48 hours. We should consider having such a similar mechanism in place.</p><p>I hope that Deputy Prime Minister Heng and the team behind the Budget will take these suggestions into consideration.</p><h6>12.33 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: \"Daddy, why don\\'t I take the school bus so that you do not need to rush anymore?\" Those words by my daughter Ella cut through my heart like a knife. My six-year-old daughter taught me an important lesson that morning when I was sending her to school last year, a very painful lesson.&nbsp;She made me realise that it was time to slow down and not rush all the time, especially in front of her, how my actions had made her feel bad and a reminder about how precious time is.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Spend time with those you love, one of these days you will either say I wish I had or I\\'m glad I did\". I used this quote in this House a few years ago and I am sharing it again not just because it is a beautiful quote to live by but also as a timely reminder to myself and to all of us.&nbsp;</p><p>I do enjoy sending Ella to school. I love singing all the Disney songs with her on the way to school, I love listening to her talk about her dreams, how she was at the ice palace and enchanted forest and met Elsa. I love listening to all the gossips and playground politics in her school and, my goodness, there is so much politics. But, most of all, I love just spending time with her, precious Daddy-Ella time. Time we can never get back.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, we gave out a lot in this year\\'s Budget, helping our workers, enterprises, parents and their children, seniors and our environment. Many are appreciative of Budget 2020 but if there is one thing we did not give out, it is time. Time, which is priceless and time which our Government can give out.&nbsp;</p><p>We need more precious time with our loved ones.&nbsp;We need more time with our children who desperately need us. I am glad we provide childcare leave, which \"will provide sufficient time for working parents to care for and spend quality time with their children\".</p><p>But it has been more than a decade since childcare leave provisions were increased and it is time to review this again. Are the current six days sufficient? We already know that the vast majority of childcare centres have six days of annual closure. This means that, for most parents, the entire six days of childcare leave could be used just for these annual closures. Let us not forget about the additional three half-day closures on the eve of any of the five stipulated public holidays. What happens when your child falls sick or for any other times when childcare leave is needed?</p><p>Sir, my first suggestion is that we have specific childcare sick leave. Applications for such leave must be supported by a medical certificate.&nbsp;This is much needed as parents should be there to look after their children when they are sick. Out of all the illnesses, including chicken pox, influenza, stomach flu and the list goes on, let me focus on the Hand Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) as an example of why we need more childcare leave.</p><p>In Singapore, 90% of children have had HFMD infection by 12 years of age. This is something almost all parents face and we should help them. We must help.&nbsp;It is extremely difficult for parents to find help to look after their children as the infection can last for up to two weeks. It is also hard to find someone to look after your child as the care-giver has a good chance of being infected. I was infected by my children when they had HFMD.</p><p>From the employers\\' standpoint, do they really want their employee who may also be infected to come to the office and possibly spread the disease or any other illness to other employees, resulting in everyone going on medical leave?&nbsp;Also, do we honestly think that the employee can concentrate at work and be productive? Would they not be worrying about their child who is sick? How is this beneficial to the company?&nbsp;Having childcare sick leave will help the children, the parents and, ultimately, the employers.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, my second suggestion is that we provide this childcare sick leave on a per-child basis.&nbsp;Our current childcare leave does not make sense. Surely, we can all agree here that if you need six days of childcare leave for one child, you cannot also only need six days of childcare leave for two, three or four children.&nbsp;It may make sense if you can make sure all your children fall sick at the same time, which is not quite possible.</p><p>Sir, having childcare sick leave and having it on a per-child basis is not something foreign to this Government.&nbsp;The Public Service, one of the largest employers in Singapore, already gives some officers childcare sick leave and it is on a per-child basis.&nbsp;For example, officers with two children, one of whom is below age seven is eligible for four days of childcare leave per year with MC. An officer with three or more children, has nine days of childcare leave per year with MC. This is on top of the six days of childcare leave per year.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government clearly feels that childcare leave is important for people who work for the Government, why then would it not be important for the people we serve? Let us level the playing field.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;There may be an argument that giving more childcare leave can inadvertently affect the employment prospects of parents with more children. But this is not the case for the Public Service and, surely, this cannot be a reason for us to not do what is right for our people. Surely, the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices can be used to address this concern.</p><p>If we want Singaporeans to have kids and have more kids, then we need to give them more time to look after and be with their children. It is not just about making pre-school more affordable. That is important. But many I spoke to feel that if they are going to have kids but just leave them at childcare centres most of the time, then what is the point of having kids?&nbsp;We are trying hard to increase our TFR and beyond looking at the dollars and cents, we also need to look into providing parents with more time to spend with their children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The reply to my suggestions might be that we rather focus on flexible work arrangements. But this is not a zero-sum game. We can work on providing more flexible working arrangements for our people but also legislate more childcare leave.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, Deputy Speaker Charles Chong gave me one of the best advices just before the last General Elections. I used to help out at his Meet-the-People Session (MPS) and he always made sure I go home as early as possible once MPS ended. He said to me, \"Louis, make sure you don’t go home one day and your daughter calls you uncle!\". That advice is not just for me but for everyone and a timely reminder that while we work hard, we should also spend quality time with our loved ones.&nbsp;And it is not just about spending time with our children but also with our parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I am glad that all civil servants are eligible for up to two days of parent-care leave per year and that a growing number of civil servants are using both days of leave.&nbsp;The Government has stated, \"With a rapidly ageing population and smaller family units, officers with elderly parents will need time to take care of them. The new parent-care leave reflects our position as a family-friendly employer.\"&nbsp;</p><p>It is encouraging that an increasing number of private companies are providing this. In 2018, 20% of private sector companies offered such leave benefits, up from 15% in 2012. But 20% is still really a small percentage.</p><p>Our parents are the reason we are here today. They worked hard to bring us up and looked after us when we were young. We should be there for them when they are aging and now need us to look after them.</p><p>Sir, I lost my Dad five years ago. On 11 May 2015, I was getting ready to go to work and I told my wife I was going to inform the ACRES team that I needed to take some time off to spend with my Dad who was in hospital.&nbsp;I was already visiting him every day but I decided I should spend more time with him. As I was about to leave my house, my sister called and told me that Daddy had lost consciousness. He passed away that day.&nbsp;I really wish I can turn back time. I made a mistake and I regret it till today. I wish I had spent more time with Daddy and I miss him dearly.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps, through sharing this with everyone, this wound might finally heal and, through sharing, I hope that others will not make the same mistake I made. Spend time with those you love and remember that life is a one-way ticket.</p><p>Sir, this Government recognises that we need to spend time to look after our parents. It has been eight years since we introduced parent-care leave in the Civil Service and it is now time for everyone else to have this. It is time to legislate it.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government\\'s statement: \"With a rapidly ageing population and smaller family units, officers with elderly parents will need time to take care of them\", holds true for all of us and not just civil servants.&nbsp;If the Government feels that it is important for civil servants to have parent-care leave, then why not others?&nbsp;We are a family-friendly employer and now we should be a family-friendly Government.&nbsp;</p><p>I understand that the tripartite partners have also encouraged more employers to adopt the Tripartite Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, regardless of whether they already provide parent-care leave.&nbsp;But this is unpaid leave. Why do civil servants get paid parent-care leave and others have unpaid leave? Again, can we level this playing field?</p><p>I also understand that care-givers have given feedback that they prefer flexible work arrangements over parental leave as a more sustainable way to balance work and care-giving responsibilities.&nbsp;But the parent-care leave we provide to everyone can, again, be the same as those provided to civil servants where they have the flexibility to take this leave in full or half-day blocks. This will address the feedback we have received and, if we want to, we can take it a step further and offer parent-care leave in blocks of hours.&nbsp;It is, ultimately, a personal choice to take leave to spend time with those you love but this Government can help make things easier for employees and I hope we do so.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, the Prime Minister said a few months ago that, \"We will always stand with workers (and) ensure your well-being. We will always do our best to help you and your children progress with Singapore and have a better life\".&nbsp;Let us also stand with our workers when it comes to childcare leave and parent-care leave.</p><p>Time is the most precious commodity. I hope this Budget is not just about the economy but also about giving our people precious time to rest and to spend with their loved ones.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, I hope that we can (a) introduce a new childcare sick leave; (b) provide this childcare sick leave on a per-child basis; and (c) legislate the provision of parent-care leave.</p><p>Minister Vivian Balakrishnan once said, \"Life is a one-way ticket. A baby will only remain a baby for a very short time. They will grow up before we even realise it. The thing about life is we cannot rewind time. So, my advice to young parents here is, your children need you, they need you desperately and they need you only for a very very transient time in their lives. If we miss it, we can never get it back.\"</p><p>Sir, I thought I should end by saying that I am still sending my daughter to school and picking her up. A few months ago, she made a card in school for me and gave it to me when I picked her up.&nbsp;This time, she melted my heart with her words. She said, \"I love you, Daddy, because you always take me to school\".</p><p>I am now a part-time school bus driver as I now have to send our twins, Katie and Poppy, to school as well. They, too, melt my heart with their words. I picked Poppy up the other day and she gave me a big hug and said, \"Daddy, I really missed you\".&nbsp;I look forward to more previous Daddy-Ella, Daddy-Katie and Daddy-Poppy time. I look forward to more hugs, more laughs and much more sweet words from them that give me that warm fuzzy feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, let us give our people more precious time to spend with their loved ones. Thank you and I support this Budget.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Dennis Tan.</p><h6>12.44 pm</h6><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Regrettably, I had to turn down my daughter\\'s request to bring her to school today because I was rushing out to work. [<em>Laughter.</em>]</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Mr Speaker, Sir, during last year\\'s Budget debates, I spoke of building resiliency in Singapore in economic and security matters. This year, I would like to devote my time to speak on environmental resiliency.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The world today is at a crossroads facing down the existential threat of human-induced climate change. Over 11,000 scientists worldwide now warn that the world \"clearly and unequivocally faces a climate emergency\". Singapore\\'s vulnerability to climate change is also evident. Our island is now being heated up twice as fast compared to the world and maximum temperatures, we are told, could reach 35 to 37 degree Celsius by the year 2100.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Many countries seek to take concrete action. One in 10 people on the planet now live in a place that has declared a climate emergency and have effectively used it as a jumping point for real action. Inspired by young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, youths across the world are rising up and demanding immediate action to address the climate emergency we are facing. Singapore\\'s recent SG Climate Rally is a cry for action from our youths, one that the leaders of today ought to heed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">My colleagues and I in the Workers\\' Party have heard it loud and clear. We agree with them and have sought actively to raise concerns about climate change and the policies that can be taken by the Government. We are glad that some policies have been looked into and taken up.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Yet, it would be prudent to recognise that there is a long way to go in building environmental resiliency in view of the lessons the world has learnt and is continuing to learn about our relationship with our environment. With the certainty of climate change, we, as a nation should be daring and set a bold Green Agenda to guide Singapore\\'s trajectory of development. Please allow me to put forth some ideas to this House.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We need a holistic view on climate emergency. We need a holistic response to all issues of climate change. In other words, the success of efforts to combat climate change must not solely be measured by the effectiveness of any one policy narrowly. We must also invest in and track efforts to address the wide-ranging impacts of climate change and our policies on society at large, whether be it on urban drainage systems, food security, water security, waste management, urban liveability or public health, to cite but a few impact areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">An example of this is coastal adaptation and flood protection. Thirty percent of Singapore\\'s land area lies less than five metres above mean sea level. Even under an optimistic emissions scenario, there has been projected that sea level in Singapore could rise by about half a metre by 2100, posing a coastal flood risk. Therefore, the establishment of the new Coastal and Flood Protection Fund with an initial injection of $5 billion is a timely move.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">As the Government commits to investing more in coastal adaptation and flood protection though, where will this money be spent on? Will the money be invested in the best science so that better projections of sea level rise can be made for Singapore? Will investments be made in the best social science, so that the prioritisation of coastal land uses can be better assessed? Will soft-engineering, nature-based approaches such as the restoration of intertidal eco-systems, which have the potential to protect our coastlines be considered for use under this fund, or will only hard-engineering approaches such as polders and land reclamation be chosen? It would be useful if the Government could give a sense of its spending priorities in this regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Preparing to adapt to climate change alone would be unwise. There must also be a move to mitigate climate change while we still can. Even as we have committed to the 36% cut on emissions intensity by 2030 in our first pledge, how have our efforts been to date? Perhaps the Government can provide an update.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Workers\\' Party also welcomes both the announcement by Minister Masagos Zulkifli at the Madrid Climate Conference last December that Singapore will submit its long-term Low Emissions Development Strategy soon, and the announcement by the Deputy Prime Minister that Singapore\\'s commitment to the Paris Agreement will be updated this year. We look forward to the Government\\'s updates, and to understand how they represent progress beyond our current commitments and strategies.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Next, Greening out Transport Infrastructure. Climate change has also accelerated the need to calibrate Singapore\\'s infrastructural development to meet environmental challenges. Transport is a major sector which requires such calibration. The Workers\\' Party therefore welcome<strong><em> </em></strong>the Government phasing out all ICE vehicles by 2040. However, many practical EV issues are to be hammered out in the interim and I will like to ask what actions the Government will take on them.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The biggest elephant in the room is on rebuilding an infrastructure currently tailored for ICE engines. The power grid in particular will be taxed. While Singapore is in a power glut now, electricity demand will only go up as Singapore moves on in its Smart Nation ambitions. One looks to Sweden with a ban on ICE vehicles slated for 2030, where demand for electricity is currently outgrowing capacity in local grids, forcing EV charging networks to compete with other infrastructure projects for electricity.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This is not to mention that Singapore currently generates upward to 95% of its energy via natural gas. While it is the least-polluting fossil fuel and has higher efficiency compared to ICE vehicles, there will continue to be a carbon footprint generated. While our current power generation mix will improve by 2030 due to more solar capacity, how are we moving to lowering the carbon footprint of our power generation in 2030 – 2040?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Also, with regard to charging points, the Government expects to have 28,000 charging points by 2030, but even assuming a 30% conversion from the current vehicle population to EVs, it still means about one charging point to 10 EVs by 2030. Should we even be contented with this ratio? Besides intelligent charging solutions, should the Government also consider the alternative of battery swap stations which have the advantage of speed, ensuring load on our power grid can be managed well, as well as providing a ready infrastructure for battery recycling? This has been tested in China and should be a key consideration here.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">How soon can we electrify our public bus and private hire infrastructure to EVs will also be important as many Singaporeans rely on such services. Would the Ministry of Transport give a timeline on this happening separately from the 2040 overall target?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">ASEAN cooperation is also needed if we are to successfully electrify our transport system. A key consideration here is Malaysia, where people and trade currently travel via the Causeway and the Tuas Second Link on ICE vehicles currently. If we do phase out ICE vehicles here, are we also implementing a ban on foreign ICE vehicles from entering Singapore? If there is no infrastructure in place in Malaysia to support commercial EVs, would that also impact our businesses with a top partner in trade?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This is important to get right as, on one hand, foreign ICE vehicles and how we handle the issue, may have a significant impact on our EV plans, and on the other hand, we should not be seen to export our green problems away with unilateral bans. Indeed, we can work with Malaysia\\'s state and federal authorities to build a sustainable and inclusive eco-system for EVs. To go one step further, we can propose an ASEAN Autonomous Vehicle and Electric Vehicle project that holistically looks at all the challenges of EVs that my colleague, Mr Leon Perera had previously mooted in this House. This will help to focus minds towards a target and benefits interconnectivity across the region.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The effective solving of these issues I have highlighted in the adoption of EVs can turn us into the bellwether state in ASEAN for EV adoption, just as Norway is for both the Nordic region and the world.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Next, Green Housing Initiatives. Housing is another area where calibration is required. If urban planning is right, we can reduce the Urban Heat Island effect, increase energy-efficiency and promote better waste management in our towns.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We therefore welcome the HDB Green Towns Programme as it encourages sustainable living. However, will the benefits afforded by this concept be accessible only to new towns, or will our current HDB estates in places such as Hougang and Aljunied be retroactively upgraded to enjoy these benefits?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We should also not forget about private properties and improving green efforts there. Even as they make up around 21% of the total resident households in Singapore, they account for 41.4% of the total electricity consumed in 2018. Therefore, improved greening efforts there can help net bigger gains. Would the Government consider expanding the Estate Upgrading Programme to include greening items for private estates? This may include solar-friendly installations in common areas and greening up shelters or building community gardens that act as carbon sinks.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Also, could there be further incentives to push for solar installations across private households that allow excess power to be sold back to the power grid? Currently, payment is made by way of a credit adjustment based on the prevailing nodal prices. However, there does not seem to be incentives beyond that for private households. If private property owners can buy in to such plans, this can help us reach the 2 GWp capacity target sooner and give further sustainability and robustness to our power grid.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Let us next talk about Protecting our Green Areas and Redefining Development.&nbsp;In addition to gearing up our economy and infrastructure to prepare for the climate emergency, it is worthwhile to ask ourselves whether we are doing our best to reap the benefits of environmental sustainability for our society.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Government often lauds its green accomplishments under the City in a Garden paradigm&nbsp;– on increasing accessibility to parks, on the upkeep of community gardens, and on projects like Gardens by the Bay, for example. Each of these efforts bear their own positive outcomes for environmental education, community involvement, ecotourism, and liveability. But, amidst the continual urban greening of Singapore, are we prepared to risk undermining the benefits provided by the relatively more natural and more sensitive green eco-systems in our country?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">These eco-systems benefit us in a plethora of ways – from helping us store carbon and cool Singapore, thus aiding our response to climate change, to acting as havens for biodiversity with educational value. In addition to their potential as sites for low-impact, sustainable eco-tourism, they provide Singaporeans with recreational value and with relief from our stressful urban environment – a benefit that is much harder to quantify but is nonetheless important.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Already, an NParks study indicated that Singapore\\'s land became a net carbon emitter in 2014. Over the past few years, we have seen the prioritisation of development projects over the benefits afforded by sensitive eco-systems due to such projects as the Cross Island Line, the Tengah HDB project and the Mandai Project. The latter two of these have been styled as a \"forest town\" project and a \"nature destination\", respectively.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Thankfully, environmental groups, academics and public agencies have come together seeking to reduce the negative impacts these projects will have on the environment, in particular on our local biodiversity and forest cover, even after mitigation measures. However, the question remains whether the Government will commit to securing the inviolability of our nature reserves and greater protection of the little that is left of our more natural, green eco-systems in the future, while finding better ways to plan land use for housing, transport and tourism. I will speak more on this in MEWR\\'s Committee of Supply (COS) debate next week.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I will now move to Shifting Mindsets.&nbsp;Beyond good policy, Singaporeans also need to come together in buying in to this Green Agenda. Mindsets must shift in the way we consume, to only use what we need to use.&nbsp;Just to cite a common example: single-use plastic bags. Can we take or use what we really need? Can we pack more things into each plastic bag? Do we really need to double bag all our groceries at the checkouts? If we only need to use say, one or two plastic bags for refuse disposal a day, do we need to take 20 bags from the supermarket a week? We can also reduce the number of single use plastic bags we need to take for our refuse by concurrently using good quality re-usable shopping bags. We may end up using fewer single-use plastic bags and may still have enough bags for our refuse.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">To encourage Singaporeans, we should ramp up our public education to reach out to Singaporeans of all ages and educational level and in different languages. We should even encourage easy accessibility to the latest research on climate change by the average citizen. Translating this research into readable, digestible commentaries for Singaporeans gives further buy-in and builds awareness.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">As the lead Government agency on climate change, the National Climate Change Secretariat should consider working with public and private research agencies and researchers on this so that easy-to-access facts and evidence on climate change can be in the public domain to build further buy-in for green policies.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, Singapore\\'s environmental resiliency is being tested in ways unprecedented. We should spare no effort to lead the region and the world in this effort, not only as an honest broker but also as an innovator in the space. As such, a bold Green Agenda should be considered as Singapore moves to the next chapter of nation-building. We owe it to our future generations to do so.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Cedric Foo.</p><h6>1.00 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore\\'s success is evident. Whether it is the PISA scores of our 15-year-olds, our economic competitiveness, our healthcare outcomes, our CPF system or our public housing, the world looks to us as a model of a highly-functioning and thriving country. To be sure, we are still a young nation and we too, look to other nations for examples of how to do better here.</p><p>Singapore\\'s per capita income was about S$1,600 when we became independent in 1965&nbsp;– just S$1,600. Today, our per capita income is about S$90,000 (in 2019). This is more than a 50-fold increase in a short span of 54 years. Put it another way, we have achieved a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 8% on average, each and every year over the last 54 years.</p><p>How did we manage to do this? I believe the pre-conditions of success are, firstly, the peace and stability afforded us by an effective MFA, our SAF and our Home Team. Beyond that, an effective and honest government, which is sometimes quite rare, and working hand-in-hand with our employers and workers.</p><p>These pre-conditions are necessary but not sufficient. I can think of two key principles that have served us well and have brought us here.</p><p>The first is fiscal prudence. Achieving fiscal prudence starts with having a balanced budget during every term of Government. Unlike in many other countries, Singapore has been building up its reserves, instead of running deficits. How we achieve this is to ensure that recurrent revenue – those that are built into our system and are not one-off in nature&nbsp;– equals to or exceeds recurrent expenditures&nbsp;– those that we expect to incur year after year after year and not one-off in nature. So, recurrent revenue must equal or exceed recurrent expenses. That is a formula for a balanced Budget and that is very important for fiscal prudence.</p><p>As pointed out in this House, Singapore is facing rising health care costs for two reasons&nbsp;– advances in medical technology and, specific to Singapore, a very rapidly ageing population. And also because we did so well in healthcare, our life expectancy is getting longer and that also mean that medical costs will go up.</p><p>Singapore’s healthcare expenditure is budgeted at S$13.4 billion for this year\\'s Budget and that is an increase of 16% just from last year\\'s Budget. This figure is expected to further increase over the next decade for the reasons I cited. This means that we have to address such increase in healthcare costs soon if we do not want to kick the can down the road for a future government to deal with, and to do so, in a way, by using recurring revenue because rising healthcare costs is a recurring expenditure.</p><p>Therefore, the Finance Minister has recommended a GST rate increase of two percentage points to take place between 2022 and 2025.</p><p>Now, the need for more recurring revenue becomes even clearer if we also consider two other risks to our fiscal revenues.</p><p>First, our Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) and, secondly, the OECD\\'s proposed Base Erosion and Profit Shifting\\'s (BEPS) regime.</p><p>First, let me talk about the risk of a lower NIRC.&nbsp;Today, the Net Investment Returns Contribution from our reserves is the biggest component of our revenue. In fact, NIRC is expected&nbsp;to&nbsp;be S$17 billion in our 2020 Budget, but lower than the S$19 billion in FY2019. Going forward, it will be increasingly challenging to achieve similarly high NIRC due to the very low interest rate environment all around the world. In fact, last night\\'s 10-year treasury is about 1.35%. So, 1.35% for 10 year\\'s money. In some other countries like Germany, Switzerland, Japan and so forth, they are even experiencing negative interest rates.</p><p>GIC\\'s mission is to beat inflation by investing in non-Singapore dollar assets and one of the instruments that they would use would be bonds. And if interest rates remain low, the risk of achieving high NIRC over the next decade or so, may become more challenging.</p><p>Secondly there is a proposed OECD Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS) regime. What it means is that the OECD seeks to change&nbsp;the current corporate tax system from one which is based on the \"residency of the company\". So, if you are a company incorporated in Singapore, you pay taxes here. If this company has a subsidiary in the UK, it pays taxes in the UK. The proposal here is to change that concept of \"residency of the company\" to one where the \"consumer is based\". So, even if you are a company based in Singapore but if you sell digital services or other products or services to another country, say, in the United States, which has a large consumer base, then the US will be the country collecting the taxes.</p><p>Singapore is a small hub economy with a lower consumer base compared to larger economies&nbsp;with&nbsp;higher consumption. Should the OECD\\'s BEPS proposal be adopted, we could end up with lower corporate tax revenues.</p><p>So, the two risks are our NIRC, facing challenges to generate high returns and, secondly, if the OECD\\'s BEPS is adopted, then our corporate tax revenue will be negatively affected.</p><p>It is understandable that raising GST is very unpopular. But as an honest Government, we need to level with our people and we need to continue to abide by the principle of fiscal prudence, having recurring revenue matching or exceeding recurring expenses. And this is the formula which has secured Singapore\\'s success so far and we should not throw that away. Of course, this Government can ignore it because I do not think we will run into deep problems any time soon. But this is like kicking the can down the road and letting future generations deal with the problems. I do not think this is the right way forward.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I hope that the Finance Minister, when raising GST, would&nbsp;design the Assurance Package in such a way that makes GST progressive.&nbsp;So, while we raise recurrent revenue, we also try to reduce the income inequality here in Singapore.</p><p>But some have argued forget about raising GST. After all, we have big reserves. So, why not dip into it to fund our expenditure. Again, our reserves is finite and if we have recurring expenses, we need to think about recurring revenue in the system and not dip into a finite savings pool.</p><p>But more important than that, we should not forget that Singapore is a country without natural resources. We have no oil, no&nbsp;natural gas, no minerals, no gold, no silver, the list goes on, we just have no natural resources, period! Our financial reserves is our only reserve. If we deplete it, Singapore has no&nbsp;fall-back. We have no back-stop facility to draw upon. We have no European Union equivalent to bail us out. And if we have to resort to the IMF as past examples have shown, we would have to go \"hat-in-hand\" and such rescue&nbsp;package will come with many, many onerous conditions that will bog us down for many, many years to come. This is not where we want to be.</p><p>It is indeed the fiduciary duty of the government, as stewards, to ensure the fiscal sustainability and not to squander away the reserves, which, strictly speaking, we did not earn in totality but our forefathers and past governments have earned it for us. We inherited it. Therefore, squandering it would be leaving future generations ill equipped and vulnerable to deal with future crisis and to continue to bring Singapore forward.</p><p>The second important principle other than fiscal prudence, is long-term planning. In fact, we should not look at Budget 2020 in isolation but we should look at all such government budgets across the years, you will see a theme emerging.</p><p>This Government has over many years built up our infrastructure. Today, our tree-lined roads, our air and sea ports and our skyline are the envy of many. We are continuing with such long-term planning and are putting aside S$5 billion now to address rising sea levels and climate change. This is a problem that would probably only happen maybe in 100 years, maybe in 50 years, but this Government now, today, is dealing with this, and this is what long-term planning is about.</p><p>The other sterling example is Marina Bay where we had to reclaim land, let it settle for 25 years, and then solving a water problem and also creating a beautiful skyline at the same time. And that would not have happened had we not adopted long-term planning.</p><p>But beyond physical infrastructure, we also invested in digitalisation, which is a very important aspect of transforming our economy. Again, looking into the future, looking forward.</p><p>Most importantly, for many years now, the second largest expenditure item in our Budget, after defence, has been education. Healthcare is catching up. This is testament to our commitment to develop Human Capital. In fact, many economists have said that investing in human capital is perhaps the best way forward. Because the more you invest in infrastructure, the more maintenance cost you will incur, and the risk of obsolescence is high. So, I am glad that we have put education right up there as the second biggest budget item in many, many budgets of the past.</p><p>Equipping the Singaporean worker with the ability to be more productive and employable will enable them to earn higher wages. This is the best way to becoming a&nbsp;more equal society. Education affords social mobility. It gives hope and it allows our citizens to have a higher quality of living.</p><p>In conclusion, I have talked about fiscal prudence and about why we should be careful&nbsp;– in fact, very, very careful – about dipping into our reserves. I have also talked about adopting a long-term planning horizon when it comes to government budgeting.</p><p>But beyond these issues, this year’s Budget has also set aside an additional $4 billion to address short-term immediate challenges like cushioning the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. And I applaud the Deputy Prime Minister and the Finance Minister for looking into this.</p><p>Although we do expect an overall Budget deficit of $10.9 billion for 2020, there is still a S$7.7 billion surplus for this term of Government commencing from 2015. Therefore, all the capital and operating expenditures as well as the government transfers including transfers into the Merdeka Generation (MG) package are all earned by the respective terms of government. And this is no mean feat. In fact, the total recurring cost of the Merdeka Generation package as well as the Pioneer Generation package are all paid for upfront and all earned by the respective terms of government.</p><p>Mr Speaker, this is a Budget I believe we can all support! Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Darryl David.</p><h6>1.13 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not an exaggeration to say that we are living in somewhat unstable, uncertain times.&nbsp;The magnitude of global events have increased and the impact of these events are far-reaching. For example, just as the world saw a potential improvement in the global economic landscape last year with the inking of Phase 1 trade agreement between the United States and China, along came the COVID-19 virus to make an unforgettable impact on the international stage.</p><p>The true impact of COVID-19 on countries and economies is hard to estimate, and it is likely that the long-tail impact of the outbreak could be significant.&nbsp;I am thus heartened to know that the Singapore Government has put forth an expansionary Budget to cushion the impact of COVID-19 and help Singapore-based companies and our citizens emerge stronger from this episode.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Government has come up with the Stability and Support Package to help key sectors of the economy – Tourism, Aviation, Retail, Food and Beverage, and Point-to-Point transport services – that are hit hardest by COVID-19. I am encouraged that the Budget will cater for tax and rental rebates to defray the cost of businesses, as well as wage-support schemes and training incentives to up-skill Singaporeans and keep Singaporeans employed during these difficult times.</p><p>Based on current medical knowledge, COVID-19 is more infectious than SARS and current epidemiology models seem to predict that the outbreak is likely to last longer than SARS. But even when the worst is over, it will take many more months before it is \"business as usual\". Would the Government cater more funds to support businesses and Singaporeans if the downturn period turns out to last longer than expected?&nbsp;Also, will the Government consider extending help to other industries besides the five already mentioned in the Budget, if the economic fallout spreads to other industries?&nbsp;</p><p>Moving on to the topic of supporting families, Mr Speaker, Sir, building on the momentum of the past few Budgets, the current Budget continues the trend of investing in our children and youth by enhancing the level of support for the pre-school and early childhood sector. In 2018, the Government committed $1 billion to the early childhood sector and I understand that it will invest almost twice this amount per year for the next few years to further support this sector.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of this investment will be used to enhance grants to ensure that quality pre-school remains accessible and affordable for young parents and that every young Singaporean child will be able to have a good head start in education to maximise their potential and human capital gains regardless of their family\\'s socio-economic situation.&nbsp;</p><p>While we have raised the income eligibility for additional subsidiaries for the Kindergarten Fee Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) to $12,000 a month to benefit a larger number of families, would the Government consider putting in place more support and subsidy for after-school student care once the child graduates from pre-school and enters Primary school? I believe this will help support families especially by providing working parents alternative care arrangements for children while they are at work</p><p>It was announced in the Budget that over the next 10 years, the Government will also set up a Community Capability Trust of up to $350 million to support our Social Service Agencies (SSAs) to strengthen their organisational capabilities and enhance their levels of service provision. This is part of the overall effort to transform the social services sector so that the SSAs can better meet the complex needs of our evolving society, especially when Singapore is experiencing a rapidly ageing population. I believe that this is a step in the right direction towards building a more caring society.</p><p>We also need to constantly encourage and incentivise our companies to employ people who are differently-abled. An example of one such company is Foreword Coffee that employs people with special needs as their baristas and cashiers or fast food restaurants that hire differently-abled individuals as wait staff and service staff.&nbsp;</p><p>As announced in the Budget, the Enabling Employment Credit (EEC) will replace existing schemes to support the employment of differently-abled individuals by providing wage offsets for employers. Can we further incentivise companies to employ differently-abled individuals by providing more direct incentives to these companies, perhaps in the form of tax rebates? I believe these direct incentives will provide a strong impetus for companies to offer fair and equal employment opportunities to everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the theme of a caring society is a significant and powerful one.&nbsp;Indeed, the COVID-19 situation, though challenging, has brought out and continues to bring out some of the best behaviour from Singaporeans from all walks of life as Singaporeans and local communities have come forward to support their fellow citizens.&nbsp;</p><p>Some have left masks and sanitisers at lift landings for their fellow residents. Others have come forward to organise food delivery and even social programmes for those who are under quarantine or those who have to stay at home. Many Singaporeans have also extended similar courtesies not only to their fellow countrymen, but also to the foreigners in our midst. NGOs have come forward to distribute masks and sanitisers to migrant workers, to educate them on proper hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the migrant communities and some have even raised funds for those who need it.&nbsp;</p><p>These are examples of the indomitable spirit and resilience of our people. So, instead of sharing pictures of empty shelves at supermarkets or showing videos of residential storerooms that are stacked with hoarded goods, let us showcase more positive examples of how Singaporeans and Singaporean residents have rallied together to weather through this storm as one people.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, in many ways, this is a Budget for everyone and every segment of the society. More importantly, this is a Budget to help Singapore get through the economic uncertainties during COVID-19 and to ensure that we emerge stronger from this entire episode.&nbsp;</p><p>The current Budget demonstrates the decisiveness of the Government and its commitment to Singapore and Singaporeans as it has acted quickly and decisively to come up with a budget to deal with the many challenges that have arisen due to COVID-19. I am thus confident that this Budget is well-designed for such extraordinary times and end my speech in support of the Budget.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Rahayu Mahzam.</p><h6>1.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Budget reflects the Government\\'s priorities and directions for the country. It has to be visionary to prepare our economy and our people for the future, but yet also address immediate needs. To me, the Budget is also an opportunity to nudge behaviours and shape norms. The Government\\'s schemes and policies send an important signal on key issues and should encourage efforts that make Singapore better as a nation.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the support given to firms to train and redesign jobs for workers would hopefully translate to businesses and a workforce that is more productive and future-ready. Incentives for energy-efficient appliances or cleaner energy products should encourage better adoption of such products and in the long run create a greener Singapore. Support for employers to hire Singaporean persons with disabilities (PwDs) should encourage more to be inclusive and allow more space for PwDs to participate and contribute to the economy.</p><p>I am always keen to see the initiatives in the Budget that will help shape our values as a people. I am happy to note that the Government is building on the efforts from previous years to build a caring and inclusive society. This year, the Government introduced the Enabling Employment Credit (EEC) to provide stronger support for employers of PwDs. The intent is to provide help for PwDs to find employment and remain in the workforce. To me, this is important as it is a signal to be inclusive and normalise PwDs\\' participation in our society.</p><p>In recent years, I have had the great privilege of engaging with family members and care-givers of people with different abilities. There is a whole range of disabilities, including intellectual and physical disabilities, and PwDs come from a broad spectrum of age groups, from infants to the elderly. In my speech in 2018 on the Motion in support of inclusive education, I shared some of the challenges faced by parents of children with disabilities and called for more support for these families. Last year, as part of the PAP Women\\'s Wing paper on supporting parenthood and families, my colleagues and I engaged many parents to hear their views on the support needed. Dr Intan Azura, Miss Cheryl Chan and I had carried out an online survey to get a sensing of the needs of these families and we also held a dialogue to hear their stories. We had to summarise much of the information we received to fit the paper, but we shared our insights with the relevant Ministries after the paper was finalised.</p><p>Through this experience, we have found that: firstly, there is still a lack of awareness of the different types of support available for families with children with different needs. Secondly, there are specific circumstances in each family and thus the support extended needs to be more customised to be more meaningful. Some families, for example, may have more than one child with special needs and may need more support. Thirdly, the infrastructure and services available need to be more pervasive and accessible to families. Facilities, like playgrounds, should ideally be equipped for children with different abilities. We may have a few of such inclusive playgrounds but only in certain parts of Singapore. We also have a hub at Enabling Village in Bukit Merah where parents and care-givers could get assistance with some services. There is also a Care-givers\\' Pod in the village meant for the care-givers\\' use. However, those living in the east or north of Singapore may find it to be too far from them and are not able to benefit from the support and facilities available.</p><p>Much have been done in the sector, through the Enabling Masterplans, various policies and schemes as well as through the formation of workgroups to review the support to address different aspects of disabilities. However, there is still some way to go in closing the gaps to better support PwDs and their families. More significantly, one theme that repeatedly comes up from the feedback from parents and family members is the need to build a culture of care and compassion towards PwDs. Parents especially, worry about the world they would be leaving their differently-abled children in when they pass away. Could their children be meaningfully integrated within the community and be given opportunities like others? Will the society be kind, patient and understanding of their child\\'s needs? Will they be taken advantage of? Will someone stand up for their rights?&nbsp;</p><p>There is, therefore, a fervent hope that the Government continues to make effort to create awareness, build infrastructure and implement policies that would normalise inclusiveness and allow for people with different needs and abilities to be truly embraced as part of the community. This may sound like a lofty ideal to some, but not one which we should shy away from. We need to constantly and relentlessly participate in such efforts and seek partners from amongst the community.</p><p>In seeking for partners for causes that matter to humanity, I have found hope in the youths. I feel that the youth of today are very accepting of differences and have a strong sense of social fairness. Over the years, I have continued to be involved in the youth sector efforts especially through my engagements under M<sup>3</sup>, the collaboration between MESRA, MENDAKI and MUIS, and as a council member of National Youth Council. In my dialogues and discussions with young people, many of them have shown much desire for a more inclusive, more compassionate society. I am very heartened by their passion and I feel that it is so important to continue to engage them and seek their views as we build this nation.&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, I laud the Government\\'s efforts through MCCY and the National Youth Council, to meaningfully engage our young people. Now more than ever, young people are given opportunities and are empowered to make the change they want to see. There are many support mechanisms, for example, through, the National Youth Fund, the SG Youth Action Plan and NYC\\'s Young Changemakers Programme, which not only provide monetary grants but connect youths with mentors and like-minded peers to help implement ground-up projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from providing support to youths for their causes and to carry out their projects, it is also important to support them to achieve their aspirations. I note the provision in the Budget to ready our youths for various opportunities by providing more overseas exposure. This is very welcomed. I am hoping that many youths from different backgrounds can take up this opportunity. We should also continue to build on the efforts to support youth through empowerment and mentoring programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>I oversee the youth engagement efforts under M<sup>3</sup> and one of the key initiatives is to create a culture of mentoring within the community so that the Malay/Muslim youths have somewhere to turn to for guidance as they navigate through challenges and choices in life. There are also resources like the MENDAKI Future-Ready Toolkit and the M<sup>3</sup> Resource Directory which are available online for youths to refer to for information on various matters.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, at this juncture, allow me to continue my speech in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-27 Feb 2020 - Ms Rahayu Mahzam - Speech on Budget Statement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>It is very important for us to continue engaging and supporting our youths because they are the next generation who will inherit our nation. We must empower them and help them achieve their aspirations. I oversee the third workgroup under M<sup>3</sup> related to youth matters, and one of the focus areas in our current projects is the development of a culture of mentoring within our community, so that our young can receive guidance and knowledge from those who are more experienced.&nbsp;</p><p>This will hopefully help our youths grow their confidence and seize any available opportunity so that they can continue to progress. At the same time, we also encourage our youths to get involved and give back to society, regardless of race, religion or background. I hope that our community will continue supporting this effort and we can achieve our objective to develop youths who are highly competent, competitive, confident and show concern towards the people around them.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Indeed, the efforts to empower, mentor and engage youths should continue. We should involve young people in discussion of key issues and policies and find opportunities to work with them to create positive social norms within the community. There should, therefore, be an appropriate budget allocated for these efforts as well as provision of the necessary platforms for them to implement their ideas and work with people from different ages and backgrounds. I believe that if we work together, we can harness our diverse strengths and bring Singapore to greater heights.</p><p>It is akin to what we see here in Parliament. The Budget season is one of the more exciting periods for the House. The House is abuzz with anecdotes, findings and information about a myriad of issues. Members of this House pour our hearts and souls to the issues we champion because they matter to us, to the people we represent. I have seen the views that we raise in Parliament make their way to the formation of policies and I trust this will continue to be how the Singapore Government improves and builds on its framework for the future.</p><p>This Budget is aptly named Our Unity Budget as we stand together, united by our desire to make Singapore stronger and better for generations to come. Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Budget.</p><h6>1.29 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Budget statement by Finance Minister.&nbsp;The past year has been a challenging year for many Singaporeans. Many businessmen whom I had spoken to lament about the slowdown in their business due to the on-going trade war between China and USA. They worry whether their business will be able to sustain in the long term.</p><p>When the COVID-19 virus outbreak hit Singapore, it was an even greater blow to these businesses. MTI reduced its projected growth rate to a lower range of -0.5% to 1.5% for 2020. The drop in tourist figures, the fact that more Singaporeans are staying at home have affected the confidence of many.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, the expansionary Budget announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister last week is a real confidence booster.&nbsp;</p><p>As stated by many in the media, the Budget was generous and provided for several measures to help affected Singaporeans and businesses cope with the economic slowdown. There were also many long-term measures to help affected Singaporeans prepare for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Individually, many Singaporeans are happy with the Care and Support Package of $1.6 billion because it puts money directly into their pockets. This will help alleviate the cost of living pressures for the residents. I support the principle that those who are lower income should receive more.</p><p>I am also glad that the cash component of the Care and Support scheme is pegged to their income and not tied to the property type of the Singaporean.&nbsp;Last year, I had called on the Government to do away with distribution of Budget benefits based on home type alone. I believe this will benefit many retirees or seniors who are living in private properties but without any income. So, my appeal to the Government is to consider extending other benefits like the U-save vouchers and GST vouchers to retirees or seniors without income but staying in private properties. Again here I wish to stress to Minister&nbsp;– these retirees would not have income. The fact that they stay in private property does not in any way mean that they are rich or are able to sustain themselves. What they are looking for is also whether the Government can do more to recognise them for their contribution to nation building when they were younger.</p><p>Sir, I also support the measures to help keep our workers employed. For many Singaporeans whom I meet, their main concern is whether they can get a good job which pays them commensurate with their skills and experience. Most workers prefer not to be on any form of welfare. Hence, the Jobs Support Scheme, the Wage Credit Scheme, the corporate tax rebate and the rental waivers for some of the tenants would help businesses to survive the economic slowdown and allow them to retain their staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am also pleased that the Finance Minister had remembered the hawkers in the food centres and markets. The majority of such stall licensees are small businesses and the rental waiver for them would go a long way to helping them sustain their small businesses during such trying times when the food centres are quieter and business has dropped drastically for them</p><p>However, in the long term, what is important is not just cash handouts to affected Singaporeans or tax rebates to help businesses tide over difficult times. These payments cannot be permanent and moneys will eventually run out some day. Thus, I support the Government\\'s emphasis on helping business to transform and grow; to help our workers to upgrade and learn new skills; to help our students venture overseas so as to be better equipped to face challenges in the future.</p><p>This is akin to the old Chinese saying that if \"you give a man one fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach him how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.\" We must not ease our efforts in pushing our local enterprises to change and grow into efficient and competitive businesses that can make Singapore proud. I long for the day when Singapore can boast of our own large corporations like Alibaba, Samsung, Apple and Google.</p><p>Sir, I have three points for the Government\\'s consideration.</p><p>I support the provision of Enhanced Housing Grant (EHG) to first-time flat buyers. The purpose of the Enhanced Housing Grant is to allow Singaporeans to own their own home and this is important for nation building. However, the quantum of EHG given is currently based on the monthly income of the flat buyer. If the applicant’s income is higher, the EHG will be lower. This means there is less incentive to buy a resale flat because you will get a lower EHG if your income is higher. This may result in Singaporeans with higher income always applying for a BTO flat where the subsidy will not change based on their income level.</p><p>I urge the Government to review the tagging of the amount of EHG based on the income of the applicant. I also urge the Government to consider providing the EHG based on the per capital basis and not just based on gross income. Otherwise, a Singaporean who may have a higher income will get less EHG even though he may have more expenses and need to provide for more children or retired parents.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I appreciate the intent of the Government to help Singaporeans stay employable and to use the SkillsFuture Credit to learn new skills. However, may I ask the Finance Minister how many Singaporeans have not used the 2016 SkillsFuture Credit of $500. Are the unutilised figures within the expectation of the Government?</p><p>Will the Government consider targeted useful courses that would help nudge Singaporeans to apply to use these funds to improve themselves to upgrade their skills? Otherwise, the 2016&nbsp;and now the 2020 SkillsFuture Credit may remain untouched for a long period of time.</p><p>Finally, in this year’s Budget, the expenditure for Healthcare has jumped to $13.4 billion. It now accounts for the second largest expenditure of the Government\\'s Budget, just before Defence. And it used to be Education when the Minister for Finance was Minister for Education.&nbsp;I acknowledge that healthcare costs have gone up and the recent COVID-19 outbreak has caused Singaporeans to be more aware of the need to ensure that our healthcare system works.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Minister has assured us that the GST hike will not take place next year, the reality is that healthcare costs will continue to rise. The Government needs to decide how to apportion the taxes which is collected and what resources to allocate into Healthcare as compared to Defence, Education, Housing and Transport.&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody likes a tax hike, but Singaporeans must understand that increased spending on healthcare must come from somewhere. I urge the Government to reach out to more Singaporeans to help them learn about the GST offset packages which is intended to help the lower income cope with the GST eventual increase.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, I am of the view that this is a good Budget to take care of affected Singaporeans and to prepare the country for the future. It shows that the Government deeply cares for its citizens and the deferment of the GST increase is a clear signal that the Government is responsive to feedback from the citizens.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I affirm my support for the Budget and wish to thank the Finance Minister for an excellent Budget that seeks to bring Singaporeans together.</p><h6>1.37 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I am heartened that the 2020 Budget has been carefully calibrated to cater to the COVID-19 situation which has had an unexpected but swift and severe impact on our economy and society. This is a big, bold Budget which comes at the price of a $10.9 billion deficit, responding to the need for help by Singaporean households and businesses.&nbsp;This crisis has shown the importance and relevance of our Government\\'s tradition of prudence. With an accumulated surplus of $18.7 billion over this current term of office, there remains a war chest of $7.8 billion, which is very reassuring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We should be prepared for a protracted outbreak as the situation is still evolving with growing cases reported globally.&nbsp;The solution does not lie in just successful containment in Singapore. It is a global effort by all countries to find a solution, as indicated by the World Health Organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Should the COVID-19 outbreak become more prolonged and have an even greater impact on households and companies than what is currently experienced, we believe that the Government would draw upon the surplus funds to finance further measures to help.</p><p>I would first like to touch on support measures. The Government\\'s Care and Support Package will go some way to provide relief to individuals who have experienced income disruptions due to the impact of COVID-19 on businesses. The combination of cash, rebates and grocery vouchers will help households to manage their living expenses for a period of time.&nbsp;</p><p>For Singaporeans living in 1-room and 2-room HDB flats, the $100 Groceries Vouchers provided to assist them are limited for use at participating supermarkets.&nbsp;May I ask whether the Ministry would consider allowing them to be used at provision shops or even markets?&nbsp;This will also be a way of supporting small businesses in our housing estates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I welcome the widening of qualifying criteria for the $100 cash support to citizens who earned more than $100,000 in 2019 or who live in private properties. This recognises that the COVID-19 situation is a challenge that all Singaporeans are facing and may be affected in one way or another regardless of their income level.</p><p>It would be good if the Ministry would share how it arrived at the various financial assistance figures. This will help to illustrate the intended impact of the financial assistance and also, the timeliness of the payouts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng has said that the Government \"…will be prepared to do more when the situation warrants it\". Has the Ministry also set for itself some indicators internally to decide on when further assistance be rendered should the outbreak crisis deepen? In such a scenario, the cost of certain essential goods may increase as disruptions in supply chains may create shortages in supply. Singaporeans may then suffer the double whammy of lower or even loss of income, and a higher cost of living.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the Jobs Support Scheme, employers will receive the 8% cash grant on the wages of local employees for the months of October to December 2019.&nbsp;What about businesses that started operating this year which are also affected by COVID-19?&nbsp;Would the Government consider helping them as well?&nbsp;In addition, may I request for the grants to be given out earlier, especially for smaller businesses which operate on tight cashflows and are already severely impacted?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Minister to review if the current reliefs are sufficient to prevent the loss of jobs, particularly in the retail and food and beverage sectors. With the decline in sales, operators will immediately look at cost cutting. Operating hours will be shortened, the number of part-timers hired will be reduced, full-time staff will be placed on part-time shifts and asked to clear their leave or take no-pay leave.&nbsp;In the event of a prolonged crisis, what can be done to support businesses so that job losses are kept to a minimum?&nbsp;</p><p>Feedback from various businesses indicated that the rent rebates of one month for NEA hawker centres and markets, and half month for commercial tenants in Government-managed properties are insufficient as they expect that the situation will take at least till second half of the year before it returns to normal. It is good for the Government to elaborate on the working assumption of the time frame for these rebates.&nbsp;If the rebates are meant to cover serious business earnings loss for February to April, one or half month rental rebates put in this context does seem reasonable.&nbsp;However, businesses seek the assurance that more help would be available if the situation prolongs or deteriorates further.&nbsp;</p><p>I would also like to request for more support to be given to companies embarking or expanding their sales via e-channels. This crisis provides the impetus to push SMEs which have been reluctant to consider this sales avenue. With the current cost structure and labour situation, it is inevitable that e-commerce would become the norm and form an essential part of any business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I would like to touch on positioning for the longer term.&nbsp;This Budget, like previous Budgets, have schemes to support the transformation of our local enterprises.&nbsp;Many of these incentives have a pre-set time period, for example, three years, or are subject to renewals or extensions.&nbsp;Companies change and transform at different paces, depending on the maturity of the industry and support available, especially for smaller ones.&nbsp;To encourage companies to plan ahead and remain continuously invested in the future, would the Government consider setting longer term horizons for selected incentives?&nbsp;For example, when Pioneer Tax Incentives were first introduced, longer durations, up to 15 years, were given.&nbsp;</p><p>As we continue on the digital transformation of our economy, more support would be needed to help smaller companies adopt new technology, not only with respect to the technical aspects but also with the costs.&nbsp;Perhaps tax incentives for the telecommunications or selected sectors can be provided so that they can lower the fees for the eco-system to promote adoption and switch-overs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Closer cooperation between MOM and Institutes of Higher Learning will be necessary to ensure that the SkillsFuture courses are of high quality and relevant to industry to support our economy’s transformation.&nbsp;The course materials, modes of instruction, quality of instructors, just to name a few, should be constantly reviewed and audited to ensure that they are up to par. The courses could also be broken down into mobile modular sections for the workers to learn on the go and achieve accreditation over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, while we are now facing an intimidating combination of challenges which include a global health concern, economic transformations and geopolitical tensions, I remain optimistic that we will be able to emerge from this victorious and become even more competitive and nimble.&nbsp;The trust among our people, our businesses and the Government is strong and that is the main reason for my belief.&nbsp;I would like to conclude with my hearty support for the Budget.&nbsp;</p><h6>1.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>: Mr Speaker, this is is a responsive, responsible and remarkable Budget.&nbsp;Responsive because it addresses an immediate crisis. Responsible because it remains fiscally sound. Remarkable because it took all of a few weeks to prepare. This is a Budget for extraordinary times.&nbsp;That we are facing potential global financial instability is moot. What we face is not just an invisible enemy but also the real visible damage it causes to the economy.</p><p>Last Sunday, I stopped by Marina Square at about 1.20 pm between my events.&nbsp;I wanted to pick up some things from a maternity shop. I was somewhat apprehensive because&nbsp;I knew how crowded Marina Square can be at the weekends. Yet, I entered a carpark that was sparse.&nbsp;From the carpark to the shop,&nbsp;I consciously counted a total of only 38 shoppers. At one of the empty children\\'s playgrounds in the shopping centre,&nbsp;I saw the counter staff staring blankly into space because there was never one shadow of a child within the space.&nbsp;At Jewel, outlets famous for their long queues were momentarily famous for non-existent queues.&nbsp;Although the crowds and confidence has returned in the last week, the damage has been done.&nbsp;Heartland malls have fared better a little bit better but still report lower numbers than usual. People are taking precautions.&nbsp;Food and grocery delivery services perhaps have benefited most from this crisis, But tourism and service sectors hit directly will take time to recover. This is also no longer a regional problem. It is not a regional illness anymore. It has global reach.</p><p>A responsive expansionary Budget is a needed assurance The $5.6 billion Stabilisation and Support Package, even if adjusted for inflation, far outstrips the $230 million SARS package in 2003. This is not just for business but for Singaporean.</p><p>The $1.6 billion Care and Support Package not only provides a leg up but also goes towards, hopefully, stimulating the economy through spending There are not many governments that can do this and do this quickly, and be so detailed in its response to a crisis.</p><p>Yet questions remain: one, is it enough? Two, can we do more? And three, when will we do more?</p><p>The MTI has downgraded the 2020 economic growth forecast, projected between -0.5% and 1.5% on the impact of COVID-19, just slightly better than Hong Kong’s projected -1.5% to 0.5%. According to the S&amp;P Dow Jones, the S&amp;P 500 has wiped out $2.138 trillion since last Wednesday with $1.737 trillion or 63% loss in two days of trade since the start of the week. And this is just on fear of COVID-19 impacting the Amercian economy.&nbsp;We need therefore to buffer ourselves against a potential recession.</p><p>The two packages are significant, but how much will the needle move? How much does the Government expect the worst downside to be?&nbsp;Are we able and prepared to do more? Can we still as responsive as we are currently?&nbsp;People are worried for their livelihoods.&nbsp;They have taken to heart with what this Budget has provided.&nbsp;But it may take more than care, support and stabilisation to shore up, if this drags on.</p><p>During the Ministerial Statement on COVID-19, I asked if more can be done quicker. I am heartened by the Budget announcements but urge more haste and more heart for those who are affected. And&nbsp;I hope Deputy Prime Minister can provide further reassurance on this.</p><p>While we need to be responsive, we also need to be&nbsp;responsible. We expect to run an overall Budget deficit of $10.95 billion.&nbsp;This is about 2.1% of our GDP.&nbsp;Yet our fiscal prudence means we will not be drawing on past reserves. This is a hallmark of stability and a responsible Government. There are not many governments that can do this.&nbsp;We only need to look around us and observe how things can go&nbsp;wrong. Getting our politics right is key. Looking north in the last few days, we are lucky to be spared the intrigue and drama in our system. Perhaps we should be thankful to the late Tengku Abdul Rahman that we are no longer party to this.&nbsp;We wish our northern neighbour well but we also wish that such distractions may never plague us.</p><p>In fact, despite the major interruption posed by COVID-19, we have not allowed ourselves to be distracted.</p><p>While responding to the crisis decisively, this Government has also not shifted focus With an eye on the future,&nbsp;SkillsFuture prepares us as a people for future challenges, gives us both the resource and also encourages personal responsibility. However, we also need to be mindful of how we implement the schemes. I heard feedback from SkillsFuture WSQ course providers of the challenges they face in claims, especially when participants do not complete or fail their course.&nbsp;Many end up not being able to pay and providers cannot claim. Some providers have also been told that if a trainee does not complete, they should factor the trainees as part of attrition or bad debts to be written off. We are all in this together.&nbsp;Honest course providers commit resources to develop and maintain these courses, and hope to be reimbursed in a timely manner.&nbsp;I hope that while we care for our workers and help them upgrade that course providers, been mostly SMEs, are also aptly protected for playing their part and not to be left with a recourse or assistance.</p><p>Beyond the short to mid term, the Budget also looks far ahead to an existential threat brought about by global warming. The problem is not immediate, but committing an initial $5 billion to Coastal Protection does show our commitment.</p><p>Mr Speaker, being responsible also means telling the hard truth, even if sometimes unpalatable. Yesterday, it was said in this House that, \"If you have nothing good to say, then best to keep quiet.\" That is easy, Mr Speaker, is the easy thing to do. It is easy to only say nice things. It is easy not to have to make hard decisions. It is easy to be popular and likeable.&nbsp;But being a good and effective leader is not easy.&nbsp;The difficult task is to tell it like it is.&nbsp;The difficult task is sacrificing personal standing to say the needful. And the difficult task is calling out bad behaviour when required.</p><p>This Government knows that hard truths hurt but does not shy away from it.&nbsp;Without these hard truths and hard decisions, Singapore would not be where it is today. That to me is the mark of true leadership and wisdom.&nbsp;When someone takes his or her duty seriously to make hard decisions, that is true responsibility.</p><p>Credit is due to the Deputy Prime Minister and the MOF team as well as the other Ministries for being able to respond to this crisis so rapidly. This Budget would have been a long process but to turn it around in face of a crisis takes mettle. It is therefore remarkable because it is responsive. It is also remarkable because it remains responsible.&nbsp;A government that can respond to trouble and not fall to the temptation of being populist in the process,&nbsp;all this because we also have a remarkable people and a remarkable country.</p><p>Our common response to COVID-19 is mirrored in the Budget. When DORSCON Orange was declared, many banded together to do something for the community. We have heard many examples over the course of the many speeches in this House.&nbsp;My own volunteers in my constituency asked what we could do to encourage our frontline heroes.&nbsp;In three days, we managed to pull together a programme which we called \"Cookies for SG Heroes\".&nbsp;We started off wanting to bake cookies and progressed to preparing care packs for the staff of Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. Within hours of putting the word out, the Girl Guides responded donating their famous biscuit tins,&nbsp;Hock Hua Tonic responded offering their herbal tea at cost, the Singapore Kindness Movement responded providing encouragement decals,&nbsp;Gain City came on board offering the use of their show kitchens, residents, Singaporeans responded.&nbsp;By the morning we had so much that we needed bigger bags to pack the care bags. A total of&nbsp;136 residents came together and we baked close to 11,000 cookies that day. The feeling was moving.&nbsp;One of our baking coordinators Pey Yng was interviewed for a video. She had moved out of our constituency a few years earlier but responded immediately when we asked for help. When asked why she wanted to help and stepped forward, she said, almost tearing, \"Instead of discriminating, we should be encouraging them.\"</p><p>&nbsp;Mr Speaker, these frontline heroes include our medical staff, allied healthcare workers, cleaners, conservancy workers, security personnel, back office staff and many many others. These are our fellow Singaporeans, our brothers and sisters.&nbsp;We are battling a stealthy enemy that does not discriminate. Yet a small minority do.</p><p>Yesterday, a former colleague of mine shared his wife’s experience. She works in the frontline and she was helping with contact tracing and temperature taking. Yet, someone felt that even amidst the heightened alert that he was entitled to take it out on her and her colleagues.&nbsp;Throwing the pen at her and shouting at her colleagues. Because? Actually, there is no need for a because.&nbsp;</p><p>Another resident confided in me sending me a Facebook message. I asked for her permission to share this with everyone. She wrote: \"Sir, I do not know why people treat us like this. Why is my uniform, which I aspired to and was inspired by others to don, now deemed as a mark of shame? Why do people stand away from me even when I am on the way to work, and not the other way round. Why do people look at me with a glint of horror? Have I committed a crime? It hurts. But I will keep doing what I love. I will keep on saving lives because many Singaporeans are not like them. And when those who shun us arrive in my hospital, I will care for them just the same as the others. With love, with respect and to the best of my ability because just like the Nurse\\'s Pledge I took, I will uphold my integrity.”</p><p>Mr Speaker, when this crisis comes to pass, when we get back to normalcy,&nbsp;I ask that we commit ourselves to do something meaningful to recognise our frontline workers.&nbsp;Let us do right by them.&nbsp;Give them back the dignity they deserve and in the process earn on behalf of all Singaporeans the forgiveness we all need for shunning them.&nbsp;We salute you, our brothers and sisters.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I apologise for the lengthiness of my speech because there is a lot of good to say about this Budget. I therefore add my voice in support of this Budget.</p><h6>1.57 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I congratulate our Finance Minister for presenting this very caring and heart-warming Budget which will take us through the difficult circumstances caused by COVID-19. It is like a very much needed vaccine to support our economy, especially the badly affected sectors, and also to protect jobs for our people. Having said that I would like to raise a few pointers for the Minister to consider. In Chinese, please.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah Budget 27Feb2020-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Currently, many people are concerned about the impact on the economy brought about by COVID-19. Employers are worried that they are unable to carry on with their businesses. Employees are worried about their job security.</p><p>I would like to thank the Government for providing a half to one month’s of rental rebate to hawker centres and Government-managed commercial tenants. If the outbreak continues, is this enough? Will the Government introduce more measures?&nbsp;</p><p>For example, will the Government reduce the rental until the DORSCON level returns to green? JTC or HDB, for example, can take the lead to reduce rentals of their commercial tenants and office spaces.&nbsp;I believe this will be able to reduce the impact brought about by the outbreak.&nbsp;</p><p>Of&nbsp;the $4 billion assistance, how much will be used to help SMEs? How can we make sure that landlords will share the savings with the SMEs?&nbsp;</p><p>Besides tourism-related sectors, many other industries such as manufacturing, maritime and construction, are also affected severely due to various extra expenditures and the fact that China\\'s manufacturing industry has come to a standstill. They asked if the foreign workers\\' levy could be temporarily waived.</p><p>Why is everybody looking to the Government for help in times like these? The outbreak has no mercy, but there is warmth in the world. Have faith in our Government, which is a caring Government.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah Budget 27Feb2020-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em> </em>I have also received feedback from several Grab and Gojek drivers who said that they are not eligible for the support package for full-time drivers, because they do not meet the minimum number of trips made due to reduced demand within that period, Will the Minister be able to take a look at this group?&nbsp;</p><p>I would also like to urge taxi companies to consider reducing the taxi rental rates until the DORSCON level returns to green. Many taxi drivers have shared with me that their income have dipped by 50%. A reduction of the monthly taxi rental rate by 50% will help them get through this difficult period.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Speaker, I will now move on to climate change.&nbsp;Are we exploring our full potential for photovoltaic (PV) systems?&nbsp;A PV system employs solar modules, each comprising a number of solar cells, which generate electrical power.&nbsp;Are we ready to allow Town Councils to install PV panels on roofs and vertical areas such as lift shafts?</p><p>A case in point is MPC@Khatib, our covered multi-purpose court that can accommodate four basketball courts.&nbsp;During its design, we enquired if PV panels could be installed to harvest the solar energy. As usual, I always explore ways to make Nee Soon South cleaner and greener. Unfortunately, the answer from HDB then was no. Maybe at that time, they were not ready. So, I would like to urge them to review this.</p><p>Many residents welcome the SkillsFuture top up which is very useful. I urge the Government to monitor if course providers raise their prices as a response.&nbsp;</p><p>I note there is a reduction in S Pass sub-dependency ratio ceilings (DRCs) for the Construction, Shipyards and Process sectors.&nbsp;It is good that the Government has a long-term view to reduce Singapore’s reliance on foreign labour. But if we do not have a pipeline of Singaporean labour for construction and shipyards, then cutting the DRCs might be an additional burden on companies. This could leave the companies no choice but to relocate out of Singapore, especially the shipyards.</p><p>May I ask what are the plans to ensure that we continue to create good jobs for locals and have a steady pipeline of local PMETs for the Construction, Shipyards and Process sectors?</p><p>In facing the COVID-19 difficulties, it is important to have the entire industry, that is, developers, contractors, consultants, subcontractors, suppliers and all stakeholders tackle the challenges cohesively as a whole. In the same way as how the relief measures are rolled out for the hospitality and retail sectors, the same should be done for the Property and Construction sector. This sector also holds a lot of jobs and should not be neglected.</p><p>Many local contractors also told me that they feel discriminated in recent few contract awards. In the LTA Jurong Regional Line Projects, for example, four out of seven contracts were awarded to foreign contractors. Another example, LTA awarded contract N112 tender to a foreign contractor though our local contractor submitted the lowest tender. The lowest tenderer is an established home-grown contractor. Why pay $6 million more to a foreign contractor? I know there is such thing as PQM (Price Quality Method) scoring.&nbsp;But if there is a gap in the capabilities of our local contractors, then we should handhold them and nurture them. We need our home-grown contractors to grow, to build up their experience, their portfolio so that they can venture overseas.</p><p>If we do not even support our own contractors, who will support them? Can we consistently apply the policy of Buy Singapore First?</p><p>New Budget measures aimed at boosting the retirement incomes and employability of seniors are a step in the right direction, but I feel we need to understand residents need better and get the priority right. I had seen cases where residents do not have enough money to service their mortgage loan or no roof over their heads, but they have money in the retirement accounts. To many residents, having a roof is more immediate and more important need than providing for retirement. How can we help them?</p><p>And I feel financial incentives alone may not be enough to encourage businesses to hire and retain older workers. This requires more in-depth study.</p><p>I move on to issues that residents are facing. Noise pollution from vehicle engines is a common occurrence faced by Nee Soon South residents and I am sure in many other parts of Singapore too.</p><p>If I may refer to a Swedish report published in 2009, which found people who were regularly exposed to traffic noise in excess of 50 decibels were 40% more likely to suffer a heart attack than those who lived in quieter neighbourhoods. So, the implication is besides the noise nuisance, they also create health issues and a cost to society. There are technologies used in other countries. The UK use Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) tech to dish out fines to drivers over excessive noise. Calgary, a city in Canada, is using Sound Camera and fine motorists with excessively loud vehicles. Similarly, Abu Dhabi Police have invented a noise-measuring camera, which will help officers take action against abnormally loud cars. There are also intelligent speed bumps that flatten when you are driving within speed limit. Is Singapore exploring some of these new technologies? Any Budget allocated for these? And will there be more stringent action against car workshops which do illegal modification to the motorcycles and cars?</p><p>Town Councils are essential in improving the environment of HDB residents. But often, Town Councils are hampered by regulations. For example, Nee Soon Town Council has been flying drones for its estate inspection but due to the regulations, our drone inspection could only be carried out during weekends. Can these regulations be relaxed? Another example, some Town Councils have been asking the HDB since Jan 2018 to allow Town Councils to procure our goods and services online.&nbsp;Currently, Government is on GeBIZ but Town Councils are not allowed to make use of GeBIZ for procurement.</p><p>There are e-procurement platforms that we could adopt but HDB has not come back to us on our request. Can we get some timeline for this? Also, can I ask MND to consider providing additional grants to Town Councils for older flats or flats built for the silver generation for the maintenance of silver-friendly facilities such as the Alarm Alert System.&nbsp;Such systems and others are expensive to maintain.</p><p>I am happy to hear that HIP II is being implemented. And on this note, I would like to request for flats in Nee Soon South those which were built in 1987, be among the first few batches? My residents have been waiting for the programme for a long, long time.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, despite the issues I have raised, I want to put my speech within the right context. I fully appreciate Deputy Prime Minister\\'s thoughtfulness and insightfulness to swiftly get into the thick of things, given that this COVID-19 only came to attention in January. He was able to adroitly dribble his way and roll out so many measures across so many fronts.&nbsp;He was able to assess the impact on our economy and the ramifications globally, and work out the packages, without forgetting the packages for our seniors and for families. And while doing all these, the coronavirus was still evolving.</p><p>No one knows how severe it would pan out.&nbsp;Even as we gather here today to debate, the virus is rearing its ugly head in many places worldwide. I think it is very fitting that we assure Deputy Prime Minister that we stand behind him and he is not alone. Perhaps my thoughts would be best expressed by quoting the lyrics from the Liverpool FC song: \"When you are walking through a storm, hold your head up high.&nbsp;Don\\'t be afraid of the dark because at the end of the storm, there\\'s a golden sky.\"</p><p>Mr Speaker, I would not sing, I cannot and I do not want!</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>: And I do not want to empty this&nbsp;House. But I will say this to the Deputy Prime Minister:</p><p>\"Walk on, walk on</p><p>With hope in your heart</p><p>And you\\'ll never walk alone</p><p>You\\'ll never walk alone.\"</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I was about to say that the HIP II flats should come to Kembangan-Chai Chee first, before Nee Soon. But because you quoted that song, I will let you go first. Mr Terence Ho.</p><h6>2.13 pm</h6><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member)</strong>: Speaker, Sir, the arts have always played an important role in defining our nation\\'s cultural identity in Singapore. The arts bring diverse communities together. For the arts to remain sustainable and accessible for all in Singapore, Giving plays a vital role to allow arts to live strong, develop and grow.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Amid the evolving coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak, the arts community brings people together, spreads love and positivity. My colleague in Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO), the CEO of SSO, Chng&nbsp;Hak-Peng shared \"three reasons why the arts in general, and classical music concerts in particular are essential even during times of crisis for a modern and complex society like Singapore\", in The Straits Times on 25 February 2020.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The arts is an essential part of life. As shared by Hak-Peng, firstly, it is important to maintain an environment of normalcy as life goes on. Secondly, music feeds the soul. And it re-energises, and allows audiences to breathe. Lastly, the arts help you to cope with uncertainty. Allow me to quote him in his article, \"For me, this is like building our psychological resilience. The arts help you to surrender yourself to the unknown, and the beauty of a piece of art or music reinvigorates your belief that, as human beings, we have the ability to transcend today’s problems and attain greatness.\"</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The current measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 have led to a number of shows and performances being cancelled or postponed. This has spurred arts groups to consider creative alternatives, such as digital performances, to bring some comfort during this trying time. Ding Yi Music Company held a very first digital concert Together We Stand, with local artistes and our Minister for Community, Youth and Sports Grace Fu sang in the finale piece. It was a touching and inspiring piece to battle COVID-19.</p><p>Prime Minister Lee also shared a special music video of \"Home\", performed by the Singapore Chinese Orchestra in tribute to our healthcare and frontline workers, on both his Facebook and Instagram. In his post, he mentioned that he was glad the arts community is doing its part to rally Singaporeans during the outbreak, including National Arts Council. They produced a very interesting and inspiring video called \"#StayStrong and #DontKancheong\" video, which involved many local artists and they shared what they have been up to and what they have to say to Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>Other than tapping on online platforms and social media, some arts groups and individuals continue to perform and bring the audiences some encouragement and positivity. When a group of people see others appear calm and able to appreciate the arts, it reinforces a sense of peace and chill in the community. This is more positive and encouraging than seeing each other rush to buy daily necessities, like rice and toilet paper and develop a sense of panic.</p><p>Just over the weekend, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) organised two full house concerts at The Esplanade. Just last evening, two young gentlemen&nbsp;– Wong Qin Kai and Goh Shunta&nbsp;– held a recital, \"The Erhu Works\" which I had the honour of attendingl; I was there at the performance. This is the flyer. And it was almost full house, even during this trying period. I hope such examples will inspire more to come forward, to build a more caring, cohesive and confident society, together.</p><p>Giving to the arts and culture has been significant in the past few years. For instance, Deputy Prime Minister Heng shared that the Government will set aside $250 million to boost efforts to partner with the community in projects, during the recent Budget announcement. This includes a $20 million that will be used to top up the Our Singapore Fund, which supports projects in the social and community domains initiated by citizens. The Fund will also be extended for five more years from this year.&nbsp;</p><p>I am heartened by the news and I thank the Government for putting aside this sum of money to boost community partnership and efforts, to bring forth more opportunities for all and to empower the arts.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Our Singapore Fund was announced in Budget 2016, I understand that it has committed nearly $4.3 million to more than 240 ground-up projects in areas ranging from heritage to sports. This Fund continues to help create access and opportunities to arts of different forms and engage Singaporeans of all ages. The arts build a more cohesive society and&nbsp;I wonder how this Fund can be further be extended to help arts and culture companies and enterprises to bring more Singaporeans together, groom and grow attendance and participation for the arts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak has also an impact on the worldwide economy. Economists believe that the growth of the economy has slowed down and in the case of a downturn, it would have an impact on the arts giving and sponsorship.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that a more targeted and well-defined Cultural Matching Fund (CMF) policy can help small, medium arts groups in Singapore to enjoy the benefits. To battle the economy downturn, I propose to review and reconsider the CMF. This could be a long-term measure, instead of a short-term or mid-term measure. Perhaps, the Ministry can consider to match not only for funds raised, but also for earned income such as the ticket proceeds. This would help many of the smaller scale arts groups with less fund-raising power to be able to tap on the matching fund.&nbsp;I will share more, during the Committee of Supply.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Terence Ho Budget 27 Feb 2020 -Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Arts have always played an important role in defining Singaporeans\\' cultural identity. With the increasing number of artists and people involved in arts groups in Singapore and a vibrant arts sector, every Singaporean is able to enjoy the arts.</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak has sparked worldwide concern and impacted public life. With the DORSCON outbreak alert level raised to orange, many Singaporeans inevitably felt anxious. Quite a number of arts performances were also cancelled or postponed.&nbsp;</p><p>In an attempt to uplift public spirit amidst the outbreak, local chamber music group Ding Yi Music Company held a digital concert on Valentine\\'s Day to spread positivity to frontline healthcare workers and members of the public who are feeling uneasy. In fact, online platforms have become a channel for many arts groups which seek to be heard. National Arts Council also launched a video with the theme \"Stay Strong, Don\\'t Kancheong\" on the 20th of February, with many local artists joining in the video to boost the morale of Singaporeans. The video has been well-received.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the Singapore Chinese Orchestra produced a heartwarming music video in a tribute to healthcare workers battling the COVID-19 virus at the frontlines. The music video, featuring one of Singapore’s national songs \"Home\", was brimming with emotions. Although everybody is feeling anxious amidst the outbreak, healthcare workers braving the storm deserve special support and care from the community. The music video by SCO received a \"like\" from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who said he was glad the arts community is doing its part to rally Singaporeans to fight the outbreak, and is able to continue performing for the public by going online.&nbsp;</p><p>The value of arts in the daily lives of Singaporeans have also been recognized. During this extraordinary period, arts groups have sought to encourage and unite the nation, as well as pay tribute to healthcare workers, through arts and music. In times of crisis, arts and culture can uplift spirits. For example, last weekend, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra performed two sold-out concerts; two young Erhu musicians Wang Qin Kai and Wu Fu Jun also performed to a full house audience last night. I personally attended this concert and I am heartened to see the huge turnout. The music does not stop, and life must go on!</p><p>In the budget statement announced recently, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat shared that the government will set aside $20 million to top up the Our Singapore Fund (OSF) and extend the fund to 2025. This is to encourage Singaporeans from a wider range of domains to initiate and launch more meaningful community projects. The Government will set aside $250 million to boost efforts involving community partnerships, with $20 million earmarked for OSF top ups to encourage more ground-up community initiatives.</p><p>The sustained development of arts groups is not only dependent on strong government support, but also the support of companies and foundations that identify with them, as well as the active participation, sponsorship and donation of our people. I hope that the Government will consider exercising greater flexibility and adopt a more targeted approach in the administration of the Culture Matching Fund. For example, besides providing matching funds for donations, the Government could perhaps consider providing matching funds based on proceeds from performances and ticket sales. I believe that this would help many small to medium-sized arts groups such as Siong Leng Musical Association, Nam Hwa Opera and Singapore Traditional Arts Centre, so that they can benefit from the Culture Matching Fund despite limited fundraising resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Arts knows no boundaries in terms of age and background, everyone can enjoy the arts. Arts helps to build confidence, enhance one’s image and attractiveness. Looking ahead, I hope that culture and the arts will continue to bring diverse communities together and contribute to a more cohesive society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): I am in support of Budget 2020.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Mohamad Irshad.</p><h6>2.25 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, allow me to begin with a moment of self-reflection.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Sorry. My apologies. Mr Vikram Nair.</p><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>: Sorry to interrupt the self-reflection.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I rise in support of this Budget.&nbsp;A government has many competing needs for expenditure and it is always a difficult exercise to allocate scarce resources to these competing needs.&nbsp;Singapore has, for many years faced structural challenges that each Budget has had to address, including an ageing population, ever increasing demands for social spending, particularly in healthcare and a risk of falling revenues as the workforce shrinks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This year, we had an added spanner thrown into the works as the COVID-19 virus threatening lives, but which has also had a withering impact on our economy.&nbsp;Against this backdrop, this Budget does an excellent job of both addressing our short-term needs in relation to cushioning the economic impact of COVID-19 while continuing to invest in our people and meeting our country\\'s long-term structural needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I will focus on the implications of COVID-19 for us in this speech, as I believe it is an important area in which the Government can send the right signals and messages, but ultimately, the entire population needs to come together with the right mindset to weather the storm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The situation in relation to COVID-19 is rapidly evolving.&nbsp;Singapore has dealt with pandemics before in recent memory. This includes the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009.&nbsp;COVID-19 appears to be less deadly than SARS, but more infectious but less infectious than H1N1. And while it has killed many people in Wuhan and China, the overall death rate appears to go down as more cases are diagnosed and we have evidence of more people making recoveries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore had taken very firm measures to try and contain this, led by the 4G team of leaders, and its efforts have won praise from many quarters.&nbsp;We had to develop a strategy for dealing with the virus in very short order, including developing protocols for confining those at risk, treating those who were diagnosed and, at the same time, trying to keep the economy going.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Businesses were encouraged to test out Business Continuity Plans and many businesses are now experimenting with teams working remotely, and this includes banks, financial institutions, law firms, including mine and even the Courts.&nbsp;I have to admit, I was a little sceptical at first about the need for trying out such plans, but having tried the working from home, I have actually found it is quite workable and, in some respects, even more productive as you have less distractions and do not have to spend so much time travelling to and from the office. All in all, I think we can come out stronger.</p><p>However, this does not detract from the very real harm that COVID-19 has done to many sectors of the economy.&nbsp;Air travel and tourism, in particular, has been very badly hit.&nbsp;Changi Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world, has been relatively quiet, including the Jewel, where I understand you can now get an A&amp;W meal without much queuing. F&amp;B places are not getting their usual crowds, particularly those in town and employers and workers in these sectors are clearly worried.</p><p>In this respect, I think the Government\\'s measures to assist businesses are timely and send the right message.&nbsp;Rental is a big concern for many businesses and the provision of rental rebates as well as property tax rebates to property owners send a strong message that the Government is helping to buffer some of this pain.&nbsp;I am also heartened that many of the bigger landlords have also taken the cue and have confirmed they will be passing on these rebates on to their tenants.&nbsp;The Wage Support Scheme helps to cushion employers from wage costs, and I hope they take the message to try and keep their employees as long as possible.&nbsp;Ultimately, I hope we can come through this episode building stronger relationships with each other, whether it is with landlord, employee or customer and do not just see these relationships as transactional ones.&nbsp;</p><p>The Budget sends the right signal, but we need everyone to work together to make it work. Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will speak in Tamil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Tamil</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Mr Vikram Nair (Take 11) 2.30pm-2.45pm (27 Feb 20).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;COVID-19 has created slowdowns throughout the economy. Food and beverage, retail, transport and events related businesses are all suffering. Workers in these businesses also face uncertainty.</p><p>This Budget plays an important role in helping businesses and workers tide through this difficult period. It is important though for us to look out for one another during this time. For property owners getting tax rebates, please pass this down to your tenants. For businesses that get rental rebates and wage support, please keep your workers. If business is down, this will be a good time to go for training.</p><p>For older workers, please use the additional SkillsFuture grants wisely, and go for training that may help you pick up the skills that will be helpful at work or to transition to new work. The Government can create opportunities, but you need to come forward and use them.</p><p>It is my hope that we will come out of this adverse time stronger than before, like we have done during our previous challenges in 2008 during the global financial crisis and in 2002 with SARS.</p><p><em>(In English)</em>: In Singapore, we have had some good news over the last week.&nbsp;While in the early days, we were getting more and more news of people infected and some in critical condition, now we get more news of people being discharged.&nbsp;According to a CNA report yesterday, we now have 58 cases of people who have made full recovery.&nbsp;Of the 33 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving although seven remain in critical condition and in intensive care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, COVID-19 is now spreading rapidly outside our borders.&nbsp;Cases are now emerging all around the world, including in Europe, South America, Middle East and the USA.&nbsp;China’s economy has already been hit hard by the virus, with its growth forecast revised down to 4.5% in the last quarter, the lowest since the Global Financial Crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>If this becomes a global pandemic and different countries take different measures, the economic impact could have longer term implications for Singapore.&nbsp;As it is, the drop in business from China has hurt our economy and many others in the world as China is the world’s second largest economy.&nbsp;If other countries start closing borders or restricting business activities in response, there could be serious economic repercussions.&nbsp;If large numbers of businesses fail or close during this period, the implications on growth could be significant and Singapore will not be cushioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In this respect, I think it will be important for our companies to be braced and prepared for the implications of significant disruptions in global trade and supply chains.&nbsp;In the short term, for companies that need to pay wages, bills and rentals on a monthly basis may appear existential, but in the long term, most analysts believe this will be a bump on the road.&nbsp;For workers who may lose their job during this period, please understand it is a difficult economy, but please make use of the wide range of measures available, including the SkillsFuture top-ups to retrain and try and pick up new skills. I believe if we ride the storm together, we can come out stronger. And this Budget is a big help in that process.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Mohamed Irshad.</p><h6>2.34 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, allow me to begin with a moment of self-reflection. Over the current term of Government, this House has accumulated a Budget surplus of over $17.4 billion. In the preceding years, many Singaporeans have expressed concerns over the size of this surplus. They have always wondered whether we could invest more in our people. Sir, Budget 2020, partly influenced by COVID-19, provides a timely answer to this perennial question.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, I will be focusing on three areas from this year\\'s Budget.&nbsp;First, our ability to quickly respond to crisis; second, creating a future-ready city; and third,&nbsp;continued investments in our fellow Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I begin by speaking about our nation\\'s ability to quickly respond to crisis. As Members are aware, COVID-19 spread like a wildfire.&nbsp;Without doubt, COVID-19 is one of the biggest crises Singapore has faced in over a decade. As the impact of COVID-19 continues to unfold, Budget 2020 addresses several of our immediate macro-economic concerns and with such a forward-looking budget, I am confident that together we will overcome this crisis and emerge stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Mr Speaker, in my conversations with our fellow Singaporeans, many have expressed the views that the crisis management aspect of the Budget will only last a few months.&nbsp;Sir, I understand their concerns. Those of us who experienced SARS keenly remember its impact. Given the uncertainty behind the long-term progression of COVID-19, I wish to ask the hon Minister what further measures can we expect in a Supplementary Budget.</p><p>In the event that the war against the virus becomes protracted, how will this House respond? I am sure that a positive response will allay the anxieties of many.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I wish to speak about the individuals fighting on the frontlines. As we continue to manage the outbreak, we are witnessing many companies tightening their belt. Reports of companies freezing staff salaries, implementing pay and bonus cuts are increasingly surfacing in the media.&nbsp;</p><p>To my understanding, our healthcare system is not immune to these financial pressures. Our hospitals have understandably been forced to shelve their revenue-generating cases to deal with this outbreak. It is understood that this decrease in revenue will have an impact on the bonuses that our healthcare workers will receive.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, given the extraordinary circumstances, I hope the Finance Minister will consider extending financial support or even bonuses to our nurses and doctors who are in the frontlines. In this regard, I echo the suggestions made by Member Murali Pillai yesterday. Ultimately, Sir, they not only had to work longer hours, but literally put their lives on the line.</p><p>Sir, I turn to focus on our economy as a whole. I am keenly aware of the Government’s announcement that GST will remain at 7% for 2021; and the $6 billion dollar Assurance Package for Singaporeans to cushion the projected increase in GST.&nbsp;</p><p>While I understand that we cannot put off the increase indefinitely, can the Minister give an indication of when the eventual hike will be implemented? Additionally, would the Minister consider increasing GST in stages; from 7% to 8% and eventually from 8% to 9%.</p><p>Lastly, turning away from GST, I also note that Deputy Prime Minister has announced a Corporate Income Tax Rebate of 25% for 2020. In view of the economic crunch that we are facing, I wonder if the Government would consider granting a similar tax rebate for Personal Income Tax to help Singaporean with their cashflow.</p><p>Sir let me close this segment on our response to COVID-19. The rationale behind our Budget surplus has always been twofold. First, to ensure that Singapore has room to maneuver in times of crisis; second, to ensure that future generations can have a share in the fruits of our growth.&nbsp;</p><p>We are facing a clear and present crisis with COVID-19. It is imperative that we do not lose sight of the big picture, avoid knee-jerk reactions, and respond swiftly for the well-being of fellow Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I turn to speak about creating a future-ready Singapore. As the COVID-19 crisis shows us, Mr Speaker, our nation\\'s success is not something which occurred in a vacuum. We are successful because we have continually planned ahead. Given our time constraints, I will focus on our national efforts in preparing for climate change. Today, I aim to spark a deeper conversation about whether Singapore has the infrastructure to survive.&nbsp;</p><p>I begin by speaking about our nation’s food resilience. In particular, I will speak on our investments in future technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, it is fair to say that the changing climate will have a serious impact on our food supply. The rising temperatures and concurrent decline in global fish stocks are an existential threat to Singapore. I remind this House that over 90% of the food consumed in Singapore is imported.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In this vein, Singapore must ensure that we are food resilient. As the recent panic buying episode reminds us, we have the capacity to withstand sudden shocks in our supply chain. However, what happens if we face a long-term disruption?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, I note that the Government has announced that MEWR will adopt a \"row Local\" strategy.&nbsp;The Budget commits to setting aside a portion of the $300 million under the Startup SG Equity in supporting agri-food related deep-tech start-ups.&nbsp;I support these measures. However, I have three questions.&nbsp;</p><p>First, what success did previous programmes aiming to encourage the production of local produce have? If those successes were limited, what changes are we making to ensure that our \"Grow Local\" strategy will be successful?</p><p>Second, do we have a local pool of agri-tech start-ups which will benefit from the increasing funding set aside for them?</p><p>And third, does the Government intend to support and encourage deeper integration of research and development processes between business and our tertiary education institutions in this regard? If so, what funds are being allocated to this in order to catalyse the process?&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, the point of these questions is simple. As we continue to invest in creating a food resilient Singapore, simply setting money aside is insufficient. We must create an innovative eco-system with positive feedback loops. It is my vision for future generations of Singaporeans to be able to consume local produce daily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Looking closer to our immediate future, Sir, I speak about our transition to electric vehicles. First, I state for the record my support for our efforts in encouraging cleaner modes of transport. After years of investment, the electric future is almost upon us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, I have some concerns about the overall impact of the scheme. I raise them in the form of questions for the Minister to address.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>First, 95% of our electricity is generated from natural gas. Insofar as we do not transition toward cleaner sources of electricity generation, what will be the impact of incentivising electric vehicles be? Are there any proportionate investments being made in transforming our energy mix?&nbsp;</p><p>Second, it is not disputed that public transport is more efficient and less polluting as compared to personal vehicles. A perennial problem preventing greater utilisation of public transport is \"first mile and last mile\" connectivity issues. In this regard, does the Government intend to accelerate our investment in our park connector networks to ensure greater access to public transport hubs and to encourage alternative modes of transport via cycling?</p><p>Lastly, as we even transition toward electric vehicles, how can we ensure that even less pollutive technology such as hydrogen fuel cells, are not locked out of the market?&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, I submit that simply transitioning to electric vehicles is not enough. If we want to have a significant impact, we must be prepared to think boldly. We must transform our mindsets. We must transform our infrastructure. We must take the lead in moving toward a fossil fuel free future in our region.</p><p>Thus, over the next few years, I hope that this House will seriously consider adopting alternative power sources including nuclear energy given the advances in technology and to look beyond electric vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I move to the final segment of my speech. Mr Speaker, one thing which unites all Members of this House, is our desire to serve fellow Singaporeans. In this final segment, I will focus on how we can continue to invest in our fellow citizens.&nbsp;</p><p>In this segment, I will first address our SkillsFuture programme. Following that, I will speak about how we can further invest in our fellow Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to succeed, our people must be adaptable to changes. They should be able to ride the structural waves that are disrupting the world. Our aims of becoming a global node of innovation and enterprise will materialise when we can ensure that our Singaporeans who are locally trained are globally framed.</p><p>On to SkillsFuture, Mr Speaker, I welcome the Government’s proposal to top-up the individual SkillsFuture funds. This sends a strong signal about our priorities. However, beyond topping up our SkillsFuture funds, I raise the following questions for the Minister to consider.&nbsp;</p><p>Although we have done well to promote the ethos of lifelong learning in Singapore and with Singaporeans\\'&nbsp;take-up rate of SkillsFuture&nbsp;being at 49% in 2019, how can we incentivise more of our workers to upgrade themselves?&nbsp;</p><p>Second, and related to the first point, I am concerned that the current SkillsFuture programme does not maximise the potential of all Singaporeans. I note that Budget 2020 does not provide any SkillsFuture top-ups for workers aged over 60. Given our increasing longevity, I wonder if the hon Minister can extend the additional top-up to those aged over 60.</p><p>In this regard, Sir, I have two potential solutions which this House can consider moving forward. The first involves tapping on&nbsp;existing expertise of our local SMEs. The second will require us to leverage upon existing technologies.</p><p>Firstly, I propose creating a framework for a Structured Apprenticeship Programme as implemented in the UK and Germany. In this programme, students will undergo apprenticeships which will eventually culminate in a full bachelor\\'s degree or industry recognised standards or qualifications. All these while earning a real wage and being trained in the skills employers want.</p><p>Sir, this idea is not without precedent. We currently have the ITE Traineeship programme. This is an apprenticeship programme that benefits both employers and employees where students can work towards their ITE qualification while gaining practical experience. In SUSS and SMU, part-time degree programmes are also available to individuals who wish to work and study.</p><p>Sir, a natural progression would be to tap on these existing frameworks and expand the work-study offerings in our system. I am confident that our SkillsFuture programmes will see higher participation rates if we are able to provide practical pathways to success.&nbsp;</p><p>More than a specific programme, Sir, I suggest that we leverage upon existing technologies to enhance our SkillsFuture experience. Currently, our SkillsFuture programmes exclude workers with little control over their schedule, such as shift workers. Singapore is poorer for the fact that a segment of our population cannot upskill themselves adequately.</p><p>Sir, I wonder if the adoption of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), or similar e-learning technologies, may be a potential solution to this issue. Over the last two years, our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have seamlessly transitioned to e-learning following the COVID-19 situation.</p><p>Thus far, many lessons and tutorials have gone online. For instance, in our local Universities, even group work and presentations are being held virtually. This move clearly shows that the required infrastructure, platforms and systems are well in place.</p><p>Indeed, there are many models available for Public Service to consider. Such a synergy has the potential to lay the foundation for a public, open university that offers alternative structured higher education pathway for those seeking to upgrade themselves for their career progression.</p><p>At the end of the day, Sir, I hope that SkillsFuture will be made more accessible for our fellow Singaporeans. We should enable them to upskill, no matter the circumstance.</p><p>My last point on investing in our fellow Singaporeans, Mr Speaker, can be summarised with this phrase \"Locally Trained and Globally Framed\". Since our separation from Malaysia, we have always recognised that Singapore cannot be insular in our economic approach. We have invested heavily in ensuring that we are an attractive place to do business.</p><p>However, as the current crisis demonstrates, it is not enough that we create jobs in Singapore. Sir, I believe that our nation’s long-term economic survival depends on Singaporeans being able to compete overseas.</p><p>This is where the phrase \"Locally Trained and Globally Framed\" comes in. We need to ensure that our Students acquire the cross-cultural skills and deep international understanding which would enable them to compete with the best in the world. I am heartened that Budget 2020 sets a target for 70-70 exposure in our IHL students. In this regard, the New Colombo Plan initiative by the Australian Government is a model worth studying.</p><p>Sir, we must prepare our young people to succeed in the new economy. They must be relational. They must possess an international outlook and must hold their own in this ever-changing world.</p><p>In conclusion, Mr Speaker, a hallmark of Singapore’s Budgets is that in good times, we are prudent and sensible. In tough times, we demonstrate our mettle and sensitivity. Budget 2020 is a clear and unambiguous reflection of the latter.</p><p>In this time of crisis, Budget 2020 provides some much-needed stability. However, we must always look towards the future by making long-term investments in our infrastructure and our people to ensure Singapore is staged for success. On this note, Mr Speaker, I state my support for Budget 2020.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leon Perera.</p><h6>2.50 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 2019, we were considered by the World Economic Forum (WEF) to be the country closest to the frontier of competitiveness in the world. However, instead of giving in to the temptation to vaingloriously bask in such rankings, we looked critically at the report on real shortcomings so we can reflect on them. The WEF report highlighted room for improvement in respect of promoting entrepreneurship and improving the skills base, for example.</p><p>Sir, I should therefore focus my speech on three aspects of national life that pertain to the longer term outlook that we face – vibrancy, meaning the quality of the economy; livability and the well-being of the people and sustainability of our fiscal resources&nbsp;– before concluding with some directional suggestions that attempt to speak to the challenges we face across all these three dimensions.</p><p>Before I begin, I declare my interest as a CEO of a research consultancy that undertakes work in a variety of business arenas including industry 4.0 spaces.</p><p>Firstly, on vibrancy. Mr Speaker, Sir, on the back pages of The Economist magazine, they track economic indicators of various countries. Decades ago, Singapore\\'s GDP growth was consistently among the highest in the region and the world. In recent years, it has been more modest but still better than or the same as other developed countries in this region. In 2019, however, our GDP growth was low against even developed Asian economies like Korea, Taiwan and Australia, let alone the US, and this was before the coronavirus.&nbsp;The Government\\'s forecast for 2020 is roughly the same rate of growth.</p><p>Sir, while we face the short-term challenges of dealing with COVIC-19, in the mid-term, our economy faces deeper structural challenges.</p><p>Firstly, our economy is now heavily dependent on China which was experiencing a growth slowdown even before the coronavirus.</p><p>Second, our productivity performance goes up and down but it is also bifurcated between high productivity, manufacturing and other externally oriented sectors and some less productive sectors, and between an MNC sector with higher productivity and an SME sector that employs two-thirds of our workers with less.</p><p>Thirdly, our SMEs and particularly micro businesses will face headwinds, not only from the coronavirus, but also the more general China\\'s slowdown. In fact, it is argued in a recent letter in the media from the Chairman of Credit Counselling Singapore, many micro businesses may become ensnared in a cycle of chronic indebtedness as a result of the economic impact from the coronavirus episode, as happened with SARS in 2003.</p><p>Fourth, while the GDP share of R&amp;D is decent, it is not as high as in some developed countries, and there is some evidence that R&amp;D GDP share is linked to Total Factor Productivity.&nbsp;More importantly, beyond the MNC sector, it is not at all clear if R&amp;D is being taken up and commercialised successfully on a substantial scale by our local companies, notwithstanding some take-up of licences from A*STAR by local enterprises, for example.</p><p>Fifth, we continue to be successful in attracting foreign direct investment or FDI. But we have all come to acknowledge that future FDI inflows may be under threat from anti-globalisation trends that my party Chairman Ms Sylvia Lim spoke about yesterday. In particular, the deliberate efforts some countries may take to pull back supply chains to their domestic economies in light of things like the coronavirus and US-China geopolitical tensions.&nbsp;To insulate against this risk, we face the challenge of raising the game of our local firms.</p><p>Sixth, with the rise of uniquely disruptive technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things and drones, whole categories of employment may be wiped out practically overnight. The advent of autonomous vehicles may put at risk the jobs of drivers in the taxi and private car hire industry. Many jobs in back-end operations and front-end services are also at risk from AI,&nbsp;robots and chatbots.</p><p>So, one additional challenge is to ensure that our people can keep their heads above tomorrow\\'s rising waters of employability amidst the sea of economic disruption not seen in generations, not only in respect of skill sets like Deep Tech and coding but also soft skills like creativity, leadership, entrepreneurial acumen and resilience. In fact, the authors of the WEF report cited room for improvement for Singapore in skills like critical thinking.</p><p>Sir, how do we meet the challenge of enhancing our vibrancy, which implies stimulating homegrown innovation and entrepreneurship?</p><p>The next broad point I will speak on is livability. A blind chase for vibrancy of an economy is no full guarantee of the well-being of its citizens. Putting effort into livability, therefore, is one of the most crucial challenges facing Singapore. What else can be done to breed confidence that our system will manage livability in the future?</p><p>Our total fertility rate has been one of the lowest in the world for years. Twenty-nine percent of young Singaporeans in a recent survey said that they would consider migrating in the next five years. I suspect that getting livability right would make a difference on these fronts.</p><p>The approach to managing the cost of living is a case in point. Why not develop an approach to policy-making that commits the state to adjust for future conditions by building the adjustment mechanism into policy design, rather than leaving it to future acts of Executive discretion, which may or may not happen? Right now, this is done in some cases like permanent GST Vouchers but not in others.</p><p>One example of this would be adjusting Silver Support for inflation from time to time based on policy design rather than leaving it up to the Government and Parliament at its discretion. Parliament can still vote against inflation-based increases should fiscal resources be insufficient. So, the mechanism can still contain an element of evaluation. But the fact that the design of the policy has a built-in&nbsp;mechanism to recommend changes and adjust based on inflation at certain defined time intervals create some assurance that, yes, society will not leave me stranded in the future one day. This is not just a benefit for today leaving me uncertain about tomorrow.</p><p>This is a very specific example to make the general point that if more well thought through social protections and stabilisers are built into policy design, it may assure Singaporeans that the society&nbsp;has their back. And this may reduce risk adversity and the focus on short-term income rather than long-term income. This in turn may promote a culture of being more willing to take risks to re-skill, to start a business and possibly even to have children because one is more confident about the future.</p><p>Some research suggests that our economic outlook and our sense of economic security does impact these behaviours.&nbsp;And if we fail to address the challenge of livability like parts of the US and England, our people may turn against globalisation which would damage prospects for vibrancy.</p><p>Let me note in passing, one could respond to this point by saying that this is a call for profligate spending because it requires spending commitments before we know we have the money to fund it. It is not. It is a call for building into policy design mechanisms that self-correct and have built-in adjustment processes rather than leaving it purely to future Executive discretion. The Executive and Parliament can still decide not to go ahead if the money is not there.</p><p>Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to talk about sustainability. Vibrancy and livability already difficult challenges in themselves but we must ensure that policies aimed to address these challenges are sustainable and are responsible. To be sure, it is a good thing that we have large reserves that yield net investment returns or NIR, the largest state revenue stream today and that can be drawn down in emergencies. Many countries do not have this and have high levels of fiscal debt relative to GDP.</p><p>But are there not also dangers in going to the other extreme and being too prudent as it were? Could that also lead to a failure to seize opportunities to develop the capacities of our people for the future?</p><p>Clearly, we have to find the Goldilocks zone between these two extremes. An analogy from the business world might be the two extremes of spending too much and running into a cash crunch on the one hand and not investing enough in the company to develop the capabilities of the employees, new business strategies and intellectual property on the other.</p><p>Sir, our reserves have been estimated at over a trillion dollars. Every year, these reserves grow from half of the net investment returns as well as from land sales and any unspent surplus from each term of government, among other things.</p><p>I am not suggesting drawing down on the reserves at this point. But in the longer term, is there more scope to slow the rate of reserves growth, so as to release more funds to invest in our people and address the challenges we face in terms of livability, employability, innovation and so on that I spoke about in the first part of my speech?</p><p>Let us bear in mind that during the worst global economic crisis the world had ever seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s, during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, we drew down only a tiny fraction of the reserves. Should our reserves always go up and up at the same rate? Can we not have reasonable conversations about how to vary the slope of reserves growth while agreeing that the principal should only be drawn down in an emergency? And&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">how, in doing that, we can invest in our people and our companies so as to help them become the most creative, the most resilient, the most innovative, and the most entrepreneurial that they can possibly be so that they can deal with any challenges the world can throw at us with confidence?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">If we do use more fiscal resources to do that, we should also recognise that if our efforts are successful, we may be able to save and social safety net spending further downstream and we may also raise GDP and hence tax revenue which are good fiscal outcomes. My analogy here would be spending more to make vaccines free or close to free </span>–&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">a subject that I have raised few times in this House </span>–&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">which may have the effect of reducing state spending on hospital subsidies, MediFund and so on further downstream. And this is just an analogy.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, Sir, the three dimensions of national life I mentioned, are very much interconnected. However, as formidable as the challenges are, they are not insurmountable if we tackle them earnestly. Therefore, I would like to conclude with just a few directional suggestions on how we might address these future challenges from where we are at, at this point in time.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Firstly, investing more in local enterprises that can deliver. This was how the Japanese built up their world-beating giant firms&nbsp;</span>–<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\"> the Japanese and Koreans I should say. For those local firms which can consistently deliver financial and economic growth while safeguarding or growing domestic jobs to those firms that significantly enhance our economic vibrancy, more support could be provided beyond the caps and limits associated with current economic schemes. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">I had an exchange on the subject in this House with the then Minister for Ministry of Trade and Industry, Mr Iswaran in 2017. I understand his counter argument that we do not want to go too far down the path of picking winners. There is a grain of truth there.&nbsp;But some of our existing efforts like state-backed co-investment, for example, could be seen as picking winners anyway. And why not let the winners pick themselves?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">This was the philosophy of Korea in the 1960s and 1970s, where the state insured provision of loans to chaebols on large firms, which could consistently grow exports and hard currency earnings and loan support was withdrawn from those that could not consistently deliver those results.&nbsp;While to be sure not everything Korea did in those decades was correct in hindsight, that policy contributed to the emergence of giant companies like Samsung and LG today. Conversely, supports to local firms that do not demonstrate ambition and performance can be disciplined and focused on competitiveness improvement, job safeguarding and business succession planning.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Sir, this is a call for strategic results-based spending to develop local entrepreneurs in ways that benefit domestic employment. This is not a call to give away state monies to local firms irrespective of outcomes, and I trust that it will not be referred to as the latter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Secondly, Sir, we know that productivity is partly a function of investment and we cannot depend only on FDI for this investment in the long term. Can we not do more to tap on our fiscal resources to channel substantial R&amp;D investment into creating IP that is then seated to local companies in a very substantial and systematic way, but with the IP owned by the state and licensed to the firm\\'s so that the state can nudge these firms to grow in ways that benefit the domestic economy and locals?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">The area\\'s earmarked for R&amp;D investment in this way could be targeted so as to fill gaps in the global IP landscape in future-ready fields like AI so as to ensure maximum \"commercialisability\", so to speak. I know that there are limits to how much we can do under WTO rules and other treaty obligations, but surely there are ways to navigate these obstacles to some degree. And, as I referred to earlier, A*STAR has licensed IP to SMES, but the question I am raising here is how to upscale this to enhance the commercial impact and provide enablers to ambitious local firms to become world-beating.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Thirdly, many of our talented youth go into the Civil Service. Twenty-six percent of Autonomous University graduates go into the public service as their first job, according to a Parliamentary answer given in 2018. Can we create a programme that mentors and coaches civil servants in their 30s, 40s or 50s, who wish to leave the service to become entrepreneurs? Such a programme could help them develop skill sets relating to fund-raising, employee recruitment and retention, marketing and so on. Not so much training, but coaching and pointing them in the right direction as well as connecting them with funding sources including state back ones. After all, we do not only want locals to get the $7,000 jobs and the $10,000 jobs. We also want some locals to create such jobs.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Fourthly, can we undertake a project to map out the categories of jobs at risk from Industry 4.0 and then initiate a programme to inform workers in these sectors of the imminent risks over the mid and long term and nudge them to engage in re-skilling and career switches to high growth disruptive industries. Perhaps an incentive scheme could be deployed to attract local workers into Industry 4.0 sectors, like renewable energy, drones, AI and deep tech, especially those sectors where the Singaporean Core is weak. Having a pool of workers with such training could also help attract both foreign and domestic investment in these high growth sectors. Of course, any such move has to be done in tandem with the growth of investment in these sectors to ensure the jobs and career paths are available to those who join such industries.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Lastly, as part of the Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review (SPOR), can we adopt independent measures that regularly track the capacities of our people versus other countries in terms of attributes, like resilience, entrepreneurship and creativity? Beyond just hard skills and cognitive intelligence, it is these capacities that we need to nurture in the long term. It is these capacities that will be our surest defence against whatever economic and technology evolutions bring; and tracking them in the SPOR report is a nod to the fact that our policies do play some role, not the main role, or the only role to be sure, but some role, in nurturing these capabilities and capacities among our people.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the future is always uncertain but there are some epochs in history where it is more uncertain than average and we are probably living through one of these. We are dealing with huge geopolitical shifts, massive economic disruption, changing demographics, the existential threat of climate change and the possibility of Black Swan events like disease pandemics.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">But uncertainty is never a reason not to make projections and not to make both plans times of change and crisis are also moments for the agile the resilient and the creative to find new opportunities, anticipating and adapting to those moments in history like our own that see non-linear change can bring immense benefits not only in economic terms.&nbsp;</span></p><h6>3.09 pm</h6><p><strong>Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, by now it is no surprise to hear many saying that Budget 2020 is a timely relief for workers and some specific business sectors impacted by COVID-19. It also addresses short-term inadequacies while setting out plans for our strategic long term. I am thus encouraged by this Budget and glad the Government has prioritised assistance for different groups of citizens across our society.</p><p>Over the years, we have seen significant financial packages announced to address long-term healthcare needs for our ageing population, GST offsets for the lower income groups, housing support, education subsidies to level the playing field for improved social equality and much more. These packages seek to enhance social mobility, provide care for those more in need and promote greater wealth distribution across society. Without doubt, these packages which have a long tail, will have a hefty price tag as they cater for increasingly larger groups of Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, I wholeheartedly agree that the responsibility of the Government is to provide for those who have less resources and less able to sustain their daily needs. But the cost of living has been a perennial concern amongst Singaporeans, and even more so as we age. How can we better address this in current uncertain times?&nbsp;</p><p>Are the financial packages that we see now an indicator of the Government on what is to come in future? Are we moving towards more of a welfare state? And to what extent can the society safety net provide if self-sufficiency from family and personal means remain as the first line of support in our country? This is a topic that I think we should begin to consider – retirement adequacy.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, MoneySense commissioned a Financial Planning Attitudes Survey that showed only one in five surveyed felt they are knowledgeable about investing. Some Singaporeans also had misconceptions about when to start planning for their finances. Half of the young working adults aged between 17 and 29 have not started thinking about financial planning because they think it&nbsp;is still too early to do so. And just 20% of those surveyed felt the need to do financial planning only when they are looking at retirement. Whether the number of survey respondents were in the thousands or less, this is reflective of a worrying trend and the existing mindset of the young working class.&nbsp;</p><p>It is totally understandable that our current Pioneers and some Merdekas will need all the support that can be given as they earn lower wages in their lifetime and thus limited savings, much less a decent CPF savings to depend upon. But this cannot be the case for the younger generation.&nbsp;Today, most seniors rely on their CPF, housing, personal savings and some income from work if they are still gainfully employed or if their children are willing or able to provide for them. However, we need to recognise that this landscape is changing for the middle-aged individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>First, family sizes have shrunk with each family having at most one to two children. Parents are naturally more indulgent in their expenditures for every child. From enrichment classes, tuition, gifts, holidays and more; it is impossible to imagine any parent will give less to their offspring even if they do not compare with others in society. Through growing affluence, changing lifestyles and personal aspirations, it is par for the course today that each family have more expenses outlay&nbsp;over time. While general income level has risen and theoretically should be more for dual income families, it appears that meeting immediate financial needs are already a problem for some.</p><p>To&nbsp;plan for retirement which may be two to three decades down the road, may be a tall order for many of them. For some, the necessity to plan is just before they are about to enter retirement or have less certainty in being employed. The issue will be further exacerbated with fewer children in each family and for those whose children may be able to, but are less willing to provide financially for their parents.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, an increasing proportion of our younger generation are gaining overseas exposures at study or work and some are involved in the gig economy. For their benefit, we encourage more to internationalise, to learn and capture broader experiences and opportunities globally. But with rising percentage of such families living overseas, their retirement support pillars will inevitably change. For those living and working overseas early in their career, they may not have invested in housing within Singapore and the CPF contributions differ depending on their compensation package or the nature of their work. When they choose to return to Singapore in the later years, the cost of building their retirement nest will take a different starting point. By then, some may face different challenges in their ability to accumulate sufficiently for their retirement.&nbsp;</p><p>On one hand, I support and feel it is necessary for the country to continue to provide for its citizens. But on the other hand, I think it is time for us to consider if and how we can continue to afford&nbsp;these long term, larger support packages for every generation. As working and income pattern changes, increased exposure of living or working in more than just the home country before retirement, and investments in the next generation burgeoning for each family, I cannot help but ask if our citizens should plan their financial and retirement needs more holistically and earlier.</p><p>Sir, I would advocate that, as a nation, we should begin this awareness on financial retirement&nbsp;planning when each worker still has an active income and as they begin different stages of their life-cycle decisions. This has consequences on how and when we provide subsidies for those who cannot afford or those who are more vulnerable. How can we measure who qualifies or not for any scheme? That may need re-definition in future. Simply means testing by per capita income for each household may see the need for a different yardstick, or how intrusive would it be for the state to assess deeper&nbsp;on their situation beyond funds availability or even immediate family support. These are areas worth pondering and better sooner than later.</p><p>On this issue of retirement adequacy, I would also like to draw attention to the group of special needs individuals. There is a large spectrum of people with varying needs and the type of support required. As able-bodied persons, it is typical for us to have our own concerns about growing up, education, livelihood, family and occasional thoughts of what life might be like in our senior years. But for individuals with special needs, these may not even be fleeting thoughts for some of them. Some lack the ability to plan and defend for themselves, others could be limited for different reasons, thus, becoming an added worry for their parents who are ageing.</p><p>MSF has also continuously engaged different groups to understand and assist through provision of integrated support services aimed at promoting inclusion of persons with disabilities in the community and to enhance their quality of life. The third Enabling Masterplan for 2017 to 2021 spells out some of these enhancements.</p><p>In my conversations with my residents and having attended focus group discussions for people with special needs, their families, care-givers and employers, I realised that there is still much we can&nbsp;do as a society to assist them. How are we ensuring opportunities for all via our social strategies in education, healthcare and housing?</p><p>While some would argue that many recognise the need to include people with special needs and acknowledge their existence, I cannot agree that we have truly taken actions to be more inclusive in embracing people with special needs. There seems to be a lack of in-depth lifecycle planning support pillars for people with special needs from childhood to adulthood to their old age.</p><p>If we must begin the process, it starts from helping and partnering them, allowing them to be a part of our community from young. Indeed, this is a much needed step to provide their parents, family and themselves a little more comfort that they can live, work and socialise as a part of the community while comfortably being themselves.</p><p>There are a number of support that we can provide for them. I will cover more of this in the Committee of Supply debate on their living environment in public housing, their employment post-schooling age and how the community and businesses can partner them. Here, I will focus on two aspects.</p><p>One, rally the society to be inclusive from young.&nbsp;As a start, we must recognise the presence of people with special needs and their ability as an individual. Pre-schools and formal schools can do more to educate the children in embracing differences and welcoming them from within the school community. As individuals, all of us, too, can be more gracious, accepting and forgiving to families who have children of special needs. They deserve a place in our community, from the neighbourhood playgrounds to public transport and common dining places. There is no need for cold stares, harsh words or social media commentaries for any special needs individuals. They are individuals with their own rights and well-deserved to be treated with dignity like any other person. We should have campaigns that counter such negativity and give more room for families with special needs to be out in our community, to share our common spaces and feel at ease that they are one of us.</p><p>Second, provision of affordable legal support and streamline the search process of assistance schemes suitable for their needs. For special needs individuals, some may have disabilities or are cognitively challenged to handle legal matters on their own when their legal guardians are no longer around with them.&nbsp;Be it the Will, having an acting Attorney-in-fact or managing other legal matters that involve their daily lives, they are more likely to need better access and support at affordable cost on a regular basis. Having trusted parties who have a long-standing relationship with them and being able to defend their interests are crucial for those with special needs.</p><p>With the extensive assistance schemes available across the Ministries or specific to their special needs, it is not an easy task for them to navigate and know how to seek help. It is uncommon today for each special needs person to have been assigned to a social worker or being supported in network groups. When their legal guardians are no longer able to extend the help in organising their life needs, this will be an escalating concern and possibly more pressing for them apart from financial aids.</p><p>Mr Speaker, as a country and Government, we always begin with good intent to support and provide the best possible care for our citizens. This continues to be the guiding principle in our process of extending financial and broad-based support to the society. But as we progress in our nation building, it is also our responsibility to deliberate how much more we can do, whether a fiscally sustainable assessment is made for support packages and how do we address the future state of support that we hope it to be. My concerns, notwithstanding, Sir, I stand in support of the Budget.</p><h6>3.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, the COVID-19 outbreak is a test of our nation\\'s social fabric, our collective&nbsp;strength and character.&nbsp;</p><p>Around the world, we observed how the deficit of trust in government and public institutions prevented or worsened efforts to contain and control the outbreak. In one Asian economy, hundreds rallied for days to protest against plans to turn some buildings into quarantine centres. In one European economy, hundreds in a town protested having their fellow countrymen who were COVID-19 evacuees from China from being quarantined in their town, despite assurances by the government that none had symptoms of infections. They put up roadblocks, burned tyres and hurled stones at buses, resulting in several injuries. Out of desperation, the health minister declared she would spend the next two weeks locked up in quarantine with the returnees. In other places, government attempts to refute false rumours, although backed by medical experts, were ignored at best and stoked fear at worst. People hoarded critical supplies and deprived them from people in high-risk environments who needed them the most. In a public health crisis, it is&nbsp;heartbreaking to see such anti-social behaviours. Where has the “leave no one behind” belief gone to?</p><p>It is a different scene in Singapore, thankfully.&nbsp;In Singapore, we see some of the ugly behaviours, too, but there is a lot more of the good acts that we have observed. Where we saw frontline workers being discriminated or denied service by some individuals, we see an even stronger response from many Singaporeans who wrote messages and prepared gifts to express their support. We also see ground-up initiatives by groups of volunteers who engaged seniors and the more vulnerable within our communities to give out practical items, such as hand sanitisers. Of course, another example is when the silent majority seemingly came to life during the recent \"Twitter Parliament\", suggesting that hoarding and, therefore, depriving others of essentials should not be encouraged.</p><p>With decisive leadership and strong public institutions, we have so far kept the situation under control. Our leaders regularly inform the public of the latest development in Singapore, and the Government responds to queries with clarity and transparency. Civil servants worked tirelessly every day since before Chinese New Year to ensure \"no stone left unturned\". Medical frontliners bravely stepped up to care for patients, and cleaners worked extra hours to ensure a clean and safe environment for Singaporeans.</p><p>In fact, our efforts to combat the COVID-19 virus has been widely recognised. A Harvard study described Singapore as having \"gold standard\" for case detection; WHO was \"very impressed\" by Singapore’s response to COVID-19. Kudos to our Government and frontliners! Kudos to my fellow Singaporeans who demonstrated calm, reason and compassion in the face of uncertainties that allowed us to control the outbreak quickly. Thank you for showing us and the world how beautiful Singapore is.</p><p>These would not have been possible if not for the trust between our Government and people, as well as the strong social cohesion forged over time. We must cherish this and never be complacent.</p><p>Speaker, Sir, I see Budget 2020 as one that preserves jobs and social cohesion.&nbsp;In the midst of our battle against the coronavirus, we have this Budget debate. I am glad that in his Budget, the Deputy Prime Minister addressed the impact of COVID-19 on our economy as well as the long-term needs of Singaporeans.&nbsp;Budget 2020 is a responsive Budget that prepares Singaporeans for the challenges ahead. The $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package helps companies to stay liquid, thus preserving the jobs of Singaporeans. Against uncertainties arising from global headwinds, it is essential to ensure that Singaporean workers remain supported and adaptive, with measures to encourage them to be more productive and innovative.</p><p>In particular, SMEs – comprising 72% of our employment – are most in need of supportive measures to help them retain local employees. Jobs are important to Singaporeans\\' livelihood, important to keeping families financially buoyant and important to social cohesion. Various studies, including one by the World Bank in 2013, have shown that job access has&nbsp;a direct impact on a society\\'s trust and civic engagement. The same 2013 World Bank report also stated that jobs and the types of jobs influence people\\'s aspirations, social beliefs and their sense of belonging to the country. I, therefore, applaud the decisive move to set aside a whopping $4 billion to help Singapore companies and Singaporeans in this time of difficulty.</p><p>To ensure that the Government\\'s intent of providing our citizens with strong and reliable support is achieved, I have two suggestions, based on feedback from my residents and grassroots leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>First, ensure the good will that comes from these Budget measures ultimately flows through to the micro and small enterprises. For instance, passing on cost savings from commercial landlords to tenants and ensuring access to the Enterprise Financing Scheme by micro enterprises. Banks may be less motivated to serve individual micro enterprises, even with a greater risk-share by the Government, but these enterprises can band together if facilitated by the respective merchant associations.</p><p>Of course, it is not just the Government that can help the smaller enterprises. I note the recent launch of a “SME Help Fund” that aims to help SMEs whose businesses are struck by the COVID-19 outbreak. Member companies&nbsp;pooled together $5 million and leveraged&nbsp;technology platforms to offer low interest loans to affected SMEs, which must also be majority owned by Singaporeans. From application to disbursement, the process is as fast as 48 hours. I was told that the responses from SMEs have been overwhelmingly positive. When I spoke with one of the fund\\'s founders, JL Family Office CEO Andy Lim, he said they wanted to help SMEs and that this is one practical way of how Singaporeans help Singaporeans. I was very heartened to hear this.</p><p>This is an example of how different groups in the society can take the initiative to help fellow Singaporeans in times of need. Their efforts complement the Government\\'s and, collectively, these efforts help to strengthen our social cohesion.</p><p>Second, provide more recognition and support for freelancers. Freelancers are especially vulnerable to changes in the economic conditions. Many events and work assignments are cancelled or deferred as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. A number of them have taken their own initiative to band together online to support each other as they are hit by the outbreak. I trust that the unions are actively reaching out to them. Freelancers are especially vulnerable to changes in the economic conditions.</p><p>Many events and work assignments&nbsp;are&nbsp;cancelled&nbsp;or&nbsp;deferred&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;COVID-19 outbreak. They have little savings or \"fats\" to see them through this&nbsp;period of work drought. Worse, if they have a family to support.</p><p>Many of the financing options available now are not readily accessible to them as they are not registered companies and have no GST registrations. Could the Government consider extending the working capital loan to this group of freelance workers? Or help them access the other measures aimed at helping businesses with cashflow to keep them afloat as well?</p><p>As we address the immediate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, we should also not lose sight of investing for the future. I am glad that the Government continues to have a firm grip on this, evident in the other components in the Budget.</p><p>Still, I would like to reiterate the importance of investing in our people to ensure a high concentration of high-quality talents in Singapore, for Singapore. During this period of economic uncertainty, it is a precious opportunity for us to re-skill and upskill our workforce, catalyse the transformation and get ready for the future economy.</p><p>Singapore is clear about our future economy direction. We need talents to fulfil this. Technological disruptions have resulted in jobs becoming obsolete. But with technological advancements, many more new jobs will be created.</p><p>We need to provide good and meaningful jobs, where workers are empowered and have agency. But to take on these future jobs, Singaporeans need to be equipped with the right skills and possess international perspectives.</p><p>I support the ITMs and welcome the next bound of SkillsFuture initiatives. Singaporeans should be encouraged to work with employers&nbsp;to determine what courses to attend to ensure job relevance and be guided along as well. However, I wonder if these measures are enough.</p><p>Also, to attract top enterprises to Singapore to create good jobs, we need a high concentration of skilled workers with a critical mass of world-class talents. Singapore excels in the biotech sector now after 20 years of investments. A critical success factor is the large pool of high-quality talents that we built up over the years, enabling Singapore to lead in this sector ahead of competition. Similarly so for other sectors. Looking ahead, Singapore needs to offer an abundance of talents who not only meet existing demands but also attract future unicorns to Singapore from the region and beyond. As talents beget talents, there is a virtuous cycle to this.</p><p>Yet, global competition for skilled workers is stiff. In a February 2020 McKinsey\\'s article , it was reported that 87% of companies surveyed around the world say they either are experiencing manpower gaps now or expect to experience it within a few years. Respondents expect market and technology trends to play a big part in these shifts.&nbsp;More dramatically, the World Economic Forum describes the world as facing a \"re-skilling emergency\" One billion people globally need to be re-skilled by 2030.&nbsp;Companies and countries are motivated to close the skills&nbsp;gap fast. Singapore needs to be even faster – one to two years\\' window of opportunity, according to some prominent business leaders I encountered from within and outside of Singapore.</p><p>The Government has been investing and introducing targeted programmes to build up our talent pool. As the Chinese saying goes, \"百年树人\", talent cultivation takes time. But we are racing against time.&nbsp;Topping up with foreign talents may be part of the solution, but strengthening our Singaporean Core is, of course, the core solution. Therefore, to reinforce the momentum, may I suggest the following:</p><p>&nbsp;First, we need a stronger push for Singaporeans to re-skill and upskill, and right-skill from young. I am happy to know that coding is now compulsory for all upper Primary students, in the form of a 10-hour coding enrichment programme. This is a good step, but I hope the Government can consider taking an even bolder step and recognise it as part of formal curriculum. This signals the importance of this subject. Furthermore, some would argue that computer language is increasingly akin to English or mother tongue languages that we learn in school. As the digital future is inevitable, why not take that step further and recognise coding as our third language?</p><p>We also need stronger incentives to encourage adults to take on future economy-oriented courses. The additional SkillsFuture credits in this year’s Budget are a welcome addition, but to help Singaporeans pick up essential skills that allow them to compete globally over the long term, there should be stronger guidance and more targeted initiatives.</p><p>&nbsp;Second, we must continue to encourage international exposures for students and younger working adults. It is essential for young adults to be given full internship opportunities as well in countries like US, China, Israel and other emerging economies with a vibrant tech scene such as Indonesia and Vietnam, for them to gain a global perspective and foster meaningful networks that will benefit them and their professional community.</p><p>In this year\\'s Budget, the Asia Ready Exposure Programme, together with the Global Ready Talent Programme, are timely. Business China, too, is working closely with MOE and other agencies to promote internship opportunities for our tertiary students and young working adults to intern in China, and the response was encouraging. We need to work on availing more of such overseas opportunities for our young, so that we can cultivate a critical mass of young Singapore talents with a world view.</p><p>Third, we need to deepen our relationships with global top talents and facilitate value transfer to our own local talents. Could we consider a mentorship programme that attracts top talents and company founders from around the world to mentor our youths and start-ups? Singapore is a hub for many top technology and professional talents, and we should make use of this opportunity to groom our younger generation and&nbsp;benefit from their mentors\\' expertise, experience and networks. This initiative will also increase Singapore\\'s mindshare among these top talents and foster our youths\\' image as motivated, hardworking and bright young individuals who are globally competitive.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Tin Pei Ling Budget 27Feb2020 -Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mr Speaker, through this COVID-19 crisis, we can see the composure and decisiveness of Singapore leaders, the efficiency and meticulousness of organizations within the Government, the bravery and kindness of our frontline workers, as well as the generosity and mutual concern that Singaporeans have for each other. It has shown what Singapore is capable of, and how beautiful this country is.</p><p>In comparison, we have seen how citizens from other countries have lost faith in their government, discriminated against their fellow countrymen, prevented disease control measures from being implemented, resulting in the spread of the disease. It is indeed disheartening.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, the deep trust between our people and the Government is especially valuable. This was built over the years, with government policies that have always put the long-term interests of Singapore and Singaporeans at the core, allowing Singaporeans to enjoy a good quality of life and stable jobs. There should be no let up in efforts to build this trust.&nbsp;</p><p>In difficult times, the ability of governments to figure out the root cause of problems and implement targeted solutions to minimise impact on the people is very important. Hence, I am very happy that the Deputy Prime Minister has introduced a budget to deal with the situation during this critical period. Besides ensuring adequate supplies for frontline workers, funds have also been set aside to reduce the impact on companies\\' cash flow, so as to protect jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>Although it is important to deal with the current situation, it is equally important to plan for the future. Singapore has experienced many rounds of economic transformation and ventured into new emerging industries at different junctures, maintaining its lead successfully. The key to our success is the high concentration of good quality talent here who can meet the skills demand of new industries.&nbsp;</p><p>With Singapore moving towards the future economy, there will definitely be a strong demand for talents. In view of the shortage of talent around the world, some corporate big wigs believe that Singapore may only have a window of opportunity of one to two years to get ahead in artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. Attracting talent is a short-term solution, but more importantly, we need to ensure that Singaporeans upgrade their skills, and that we nurture our young to equip them with future skills and global mindsets. Although talent development schemes have been included in both last year’s and this year’s budget, I hope that the Government can consider the suggestions below.</p><p>One, incorporate coding into mainstream curriculum, ensure that all Singaporean children have basic understanding of coding so that they can have a head start.</p><p>Two, instil the spirit of lifelong learning in our people and encourage them to make use of the SkillsFuture Credit to take up courses relevant to the future economy.</p><p>Third, continue to encourage students and young working adults to intern in countries where technology development is more rapid. Aside from gaining experience, these internships will also broaden their horizon and their networks.</p><p>Fourth, set up mentorship programmes where top-notch talent and entrepreneurs can be matched with young local talents and start-ups with potential, to build capabilities, share experiences and network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;As we enter more uncertain times, with pressure on our community from the COVID-19 epidemic and global financial turmoils, I am heartened to learn that this year’s Budget is comprehensive and inclusive. This is a Budget for our people and our future.&nbsp;I support the Motion.</p><h6>1.37 pm</h6><p><strong>Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Our Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister has delivered a remarkable Budget this year. In this regard, I wish to speak on 3Ms pertaining to the Budget. You might think, given the generosity of the Budget that my 3Ms stand for Massively More Money. But no, the 3Ms I will speak on today are mobility, maturity and mentality.&nbsp;</p><p>First, mobility. Social mobility is the holy grail of governance. In Singapore, we have made persistent efforts to boost social mobility with significant injections of social spending, especially within the past decade. Budget 2020 is no exception, especially with its Care and Nurture and Stabilise and Support Packages. I welcome the various measures including grocery and GST Vouchers, kindergarten, transport and school meal subsidies that will certainly help lower income families ease their financial burdens. We cannot underestimate the impact of such subsidies. I recall that when I volunteered at the charity Food from the Heart, children from poor families who received monthly food goodie bags saw improved grades. Why so? Once their parents stopped bickering over where the next meal would come from, and there was money left over for transport, the children started to attend school more regularly and this translated tangibly into improved academic performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond these financial measures, however, what more can we do to ensure that our society is not overly stricken by the proverbial Great Gatsby Curve? This curve describes how family resources and social networks influence a child\\'s future earning potential. When this curve is too pronounced, the advantages conferred by family wealth and connections get entrenched over time, leading to social stratification. As the World Bank\\'s Fair Progress report argued, low mobility, both real and perceived, can dampen an individual’s aspirations for the future.</p><p>To more directly address such discouraging perceptions, we need to initiate more systematic mentorship for children of less advantaged backgrounds so that they are inspired by role models who have successfully risen from similar circumstances. As the saying goes, \"you cannot be what you cannot see\". We therefore need to invest more strategically in more after-school programmes where students from lower income families are offered targeted academic support and career guidance in order to bridge the privilege gap.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My second M is maturity. As our economy matures and digitalises ever more intensively, we are at a critical crossroad to consider future growth directions. Clearly, in our well-connected society where we are bound together by the internet of people and also the internet of things, a promising path for us to explore is the one illuminated by big data. The application of data analytics in virtually all aspects of life, including finance, business, urban planning, healthcare and education, can generate powerful insights for enhancing resource optimisation, service delivery and efficiency gains. With data to fuel Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, we can forge a culture of data-driven innovation that aims to raise our quality of life.&nbsp;</p><p>But that begs the question as to who should own the data and be allowed to profit from it. The social compact between people and corporations which are collecting data about us is riddled with inequity. Indeed, the ‘compact’ is one of distinct asymmetry between the big technology companies and consumers. Hitherto, technology companies such as Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba have selfishly hoarded their data, from which they distill critical insights to create market dominating products and services. If we continue to let these Goliaths have exclusive rights to exploit the data that they harvest essentially for free from all their users, what chance is there for the scrappy start-ups of the world to innovate for the greater good? We must leave the door wide open for start-ups to compete against the incumbents. Oxford University professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, coauthor of Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data, suggests adopting a “progressive data-sharing mandate” that forces companies above a certain size to share some of their data with smaller competitors. In the same vein, the European Commission recently issued a document titled “European strategy for data” which outlined potential steps it may introduce to require companies to share and pool data.</p><p>Just as Singapore was a front runner as one of the first countries to launch a Model AI Governance framework, we should also consider blazing the trail and pioneer regulation on the collection and use of big data. This will have the twin benefits of levelling the playing field between first-movers and start-ups, and fostering a vibrant pro-innovation environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly too, academics should not be left out of the data game. At this point let me declare my interest as a professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design and a member of the Social Science Research Council.</p><p>Mr Speaker, our world is beset by a host of wicked problems such as sharpening income inequality, climate change, rising populism and the damaging scourge of online falsehoods. The best and brightest talents in our world-leading universities have much to offer by way of problem solving, as the multi-faceted COVID-19 crisis has highlighted. With more concerted regulation around data sharing, we can ensure that universities are well-equipped with robust data to conduct research for societal benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to further suggest that there be greater data sharing by the Government, for example from its national level surveys. Such data can help to facilitate productive and evidence-based policy analysis by academics and researchers in our Universities and research institutes. Concerns around data security can be addressed through the generation of synthetic data that realistically represents authentic data but that protects privacy and confidentiality. I am glad that plans are apparently underway for such data sharing and I welcome further details as soon as they are available.</p><p>Moving forward, we should also consider studying the experience of countries such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom that have advanced data sharing infrastructures and procedures, to identify best practices that we can seek to emulate. Data sharing by the Government is a strategic shift we must undertake to fully realise our Smart Nation ambitions.</p><p>Precisely because our economy is maturing and transforming, change is indeed the only constant and our workforce has to be prepared for that reality. I therefore applaud the SkillsFuture Credit top-ups in Budget 2020. However, this infusion of funds will be for nought if attitudes to upskilling do not shift.&nbsp;</p><p>My last M is therefore mentality.&nbsp;Our collective mentality around upskilling must change, from \"nice to have\", to \"must do\". And this mentality has to be shared by workers, employers and educators.</p><p>During a recent conference, I had the benefit of exchanging insights with practitioners and researchers in the adult learning eco-system. We all converged around several sobering points. That while our workers need to constantly upskill, they do not find the necessary motivation to do so. This arises from a combination of work-life pressures, inertia and resistance to change, and a sense of defeatism that the new skills they acquire will not translate into concrete improvements in their salaries or job prospects. Separately, when employers are dismissive of their employees’ needs or interest to upskill, their motivation is further undermined. Such negative mentalities around upskilling must be addressed, be it through nudges, support programmes or public education efforts.</p><p>Importantly too, we cannot expect Singaporeans to develop an inherent drive to learn unless they associate schools and other learning environments with positive experiences. As I mentioned in my Adjournment Motion in Parliament last month on the fear of failure, the overwhelming achievement orientation in our education system does not imbue an intrinsic love for learning. Instead, students become Machiavellian and grade-oriented, while instructors then teach to the test to meet KPIs. To become a nation of lifelong learners, we need to accelerate our transition away from a focus on grades towards broader and more enduring learning outcomes. Students should not just be learning, but learning how to learn.&nbsp;</p><p>With greater attention to these three Ms of mobility, maturity and mentality, I am confident that we can overcome the challenges ahead, both distant and immediate. I wish to therefore conclude by underlining my strong endorsement of the subsidies announced in response to the current COVID-19 crisis. The $4 billion package announced to help workers remain employed through three months of offset wages offer a vital lifeline in current climes. By helping an estimated 1.9 million local workers through this key Jobs Support Scheme, we can help to allay the anxieties of these workers and their families and demonstrate that ours is an inclusive society where we have a head, but also a heart.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Budget.</p><h6>3.47 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Budget. I will like to first declare my interest as the CEO of ComfortDelGro Taxi Business.&nbsp;</p><p>Given concerns over COVID-19, I am proud that Budget 2020 is the result of quick response, built on a deep understanding of what Singaporeans are feeling and going through. The Budget is one which will help us all to ride through this period of global panic in a calm manner.&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like to thank the frontline staff, especially the healthcare heros, MOH’s team and all involved in fighting the COVID-19 for their sacrifices, dedication and determination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am also heartened that in preparing Budget 2020, Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his team had spoken to more than 1,000 people, including corporate chiefs to collect feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As someone who is active in both the public and private sectors, the issue of balancing regulations to take care of the interest of the regulators and the companies being regulated, is one which continues to be of concern of many. Following my speech during Budget 2019 debate about cutting red tape, I was heartened that there were anecdotal improvements.</p><p>But apart from extraordinary situation, it is important for the policy-makers to consult the stakeholders regularly. Such consultation is a continuous process and a never-ending journey.</p><p>One area that catches my attention is SGX\\'s competitiveness.&nbsp;Following my Parliamentary Question in January 2020, last month, I am glad that SGX has relaxed the need for quarterly reporting and announced that half yearly reporting will suffice. This is a good move to reduce compliance costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, SGX seems to be losing its shine. I understand that many local companies are listing on other stock exchanges in New York, London and especially Hong Kong, over SGX. In 2019, 10 Singapore firms were listed in Hong Kong, raising US$155 million. This is a 25% increase from 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Computer gaming accessories company Razer chose to list not in Singapore but in Hong Kong in November 2017. Some of these firms listed overseas are apparently drawn to better liquidity and higher valuations. I have personally spoken to the head of two companies that listed their companies in Hong Kong last year. They have also affirmed the same.</p><p>Worse, according to Euromoney.com, delistings over the last five years have outnumbered listings. The number of companies registered on the SGX fell to 741 at the end of 2018, from a peak of 782 in 2010.</p><p>From the reply to my Parliamentary Question in January 2020, I understand that SGX is not tracking the number of local companies that choose to list in other countries. It may be wise for SGX to connect with some of these companies, to find out why they choose to list their companies overseas. This would also have implications on Singapore’s ambitions to become a prime financial hub.</p><p>Next, Mr Speaker, I would like to touch on the issue of sustainable transport. As a person intimately involved in the management of a large fleet of more than 10,000 taxis, a sustainable transport is an issue which I am most concerned with. On a yearly basis, ComfortDelGro Taxi replaces more than 1,000 vehicles on average and we are keen to replace them with cleaner vehicles that emit less carbon dioxide.&nbsp;Currently, we are trying to speed up the replacement of diesel taxis with petrol-electric hybrid taxis. Meanwhile, we also have four full electric taxis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, we are fully supportive of Singapore’s drive to move towards a sustainable and \"green\" transport and phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040. I am heartened by MOF’s announcement to launch an Electric Vehicle (EV) Early Adoption Incentive or EEAI by providing 45% rebate off the Additional Registration Fees (ARF), capped at $20,000 and subject to a minimum ARF of $5,000. At the same time, the Government will impose an additional road tax of up to $700 per year for EV.</p><p>When we do a calculation based on the more popular Korean full electric passenger car, the EV Early Adoption Incentive scheme does not appear to be attractive. In fact, the current Carbon Emission-Based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) which offers a rebate of up to $30,000 off the ARF is more attractive than EV Early Adoption Incentive Scheme of only $20,000. The additional road tax makes a EEAI even less attractive.</p><p>In addition, cabbies that drive EV have to endure the inconvenience of taking 30 minutes to one hour to fully charge their electric taxis.&nbsp;The promise of halving the charging time and halving the cost of car battery every three years still remain a promise. In fact, some in the car battery \"industry point out that exaggerated claims are commonplace, and that not everyone is convinced”&nbsp;that planned car battery breakthroughs will become a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, I will like to clarify with MOF do they really think that the EV Early Adoption Incentive will entice fleet owners like us to choose EV over hybrid vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Do not get me wrong, I am supportive of having more \"green\" and \"clean\" vehicles. It is just that we do not want Singapore to bet on the wrong \"green\" car like the experience we have had of CNG cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than putting all eggs in the one basket, I would like to suggest considering other alternatives to not replace, but supplement EVs, like fuel cell or hydrogen vehicles. China, Japan and South Korea are already working to put millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on their roads, because it is not only cleaner, its driving range and refuelling time are comparable to gasoline cars.&nbsp;</p><p>We understand that in the second half of 2019, last year, the Prime Minister\\'s Office has awarded a hydrogen feasibility study to American engineering giant Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, to assess the feasibility of importing hydrogen for downstream uses, ranging from vehicle fuelling to power generation.&nbsp;Can PMO or LTA share their preliminary thoughts while waiting for the full report of the study?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This year\\'s Budget, Mr Speaker, is the Unity Budget with an eye on COVID-19. Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to speak in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Ang Wei Neng Budget 27Feb2020-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;The COVID-19 outbreak has seriously impacted many Singaporeans, including taxi drivers. When people talk about the smaller crowd in downtown areas, I lament the fall in businesses for taxi drivers.&nbsp;</p><p>During the SARS outbreak, even though there was a drop in foreign tourists, locals still go to work as usual. But today, many office workers take turns to work from home and this has worsened the situation for taxi drivers.&nbsp;</p><p>We thank the Government for launching a special relief package for taxi drivers on Valentine’s Day. Taxi drivers will receive a rental rebate of $10 per day from the government, and another $10 per day in rental rebates from taxi companies. In total, taxi drivers will receive rental rebates of $20 per day. Yet, taxi drivers still complained. Taxi companies then decided to provide another $16.50 in daily rental rebates to taxi drivers. In other words, taxi drivers will enjoy up to $36.50 in rental rebates per day. Even though taxi companies will be running at a loss by doing so, for the sake of taxi drivers and the taxi industry, taxi companies still decided to go ahead with the rental rebates. But still, many taxi drivers are unable to make a living. We therefore hope that Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat will consider providing more assistance for taxi drivers. Thank you!</p><p><em>(In English)</em>: Their loved ones are most impacted by the outbreak for taxi drivers. All the taxi companies are providing additional help over and above the Government\\'s Special Relief Fund or SRF of $10 per day. Some taxi companies, including ComfortDelGro Taxi, is providing additional rental rebate of up to $26.50 over and above the SRF.&nbsp;That is, cabbies are getting a total rental rebate of up to $36.50 per day until the end of March 2020.&nbsp;With these additional rebates, the taxi companies will go into red over the next few months. Even then, the cabbies are still suffering a significant drop in their net income. Thus, I call on Government to do more for cabbies.&nbsp;Perhaps, the Government can consider matching what the taxi companies are doing for the cabbies by increasing the quantum of Special Relief Fund (SRF).</p><p>Singaporeans will remember the good deed by the Government.&nbsp;Just a couple of days ago, one cabby by the name of Robert Chew wrote me a touching email.&nbsp;Let me read out an excerpt of what he wrote: \"I would like to thank you as Member of Parliament for bringing our feedback to our Government and working with them to offer us some financial assistance by way of supplementing our daily rentals.</p><p>These are indeed very hard times for us as our incomes have been severely hit and many drivers have given up. Not to mention also the daily stress of fearing for our own health as we are frontline service providers who do not want to be a problem to our loved ones.</p><p>Sir, I would like you to know that we appreciate any help your company and the Government are providing us to help us survive this episode. This fight is far from over and may last several more months.</p><p>Let us work together in our fight against this epidemic as we look forward to coming out of this crisis stronger and better. We most certainly will overcome. We must!</p><p>May you and your loved ones stay safe and healthy.\"</p><p>Robert summarises nicely the sentiment of many taxi drivers.&nbsp;Other than P2P drivers, the livelihood of Singaporeans working in the private sectors have been badly affected by the negative impact of the economy.</p><p>Those working in the tourism industry are the worse hit.&nbsp;Gig workers and freelance workers are also badly hit.&nbsp;Many freelance workers are engaged by Government departments.&nbsp;For example, fitness instructors engaged by Active SG, orchestra music instructors engaged by MOE schools are having their earnings significantly reduced when organisations are cancelling activities involving more than 50 people.</p><p>While there is a cancellation clause which is included in the contracts of some legally savvy freelancers, many others do not. For such cases, I will like to appeal to MOF to allow the Government agencies to pay up to 50% of the fees charged by freelancers even when their engagements are cancelled due to COVID-19.&nbsp;Such help will go a long way in keeping them afloat.</p><p>Another vulnerable group are those in society who receive help from charities and non-profit groups. As fund raising has almost come to a standstill, this is because many businesses are more concerned with survival than corporate philanthropy. Thus, we must do what we can to help keep these charities and non-profit groups going and stretch their fund-raising dollars.</p><p>I will like to suggest the Government extend the Bicentennial Community Fund (BCF), where the Government matches $1 for each dollar of donation. It was supposed to end on 31 March&nbsp;– this year&nbsp;– 2020 but I strongly advocate that it be extended until the end of 2020 so that the beneficiaries whose lives depend on the money raised from well-wishers can continue to get help.</p><p>In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has done a very good job of managing COVID-19, putting all resources in finding and healing the sick. The greater challenge now is how we can pull together and help one another. Those who can must help those who cannot to tide over the economic crisis.&nbsp;The Budget has made a very good first step and the rest of the journey is for us to walk together and together we can overcome the odd.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.20 pm.</p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;Sitting accordingly suspended</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;at 4.00 pm until 4.20 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>Sitting resumed at 4.20 pm</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Deputy Speaker (Mr Lim Biow Chuan) in the Chair]</strong></p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\">&nbsp;<strong>Debate on Annual Budget Statement</strong></h4><p>[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, from the 14th to the 15th century, wages in Europe doubled and inequality declined significantly. Inequality would not rise to the same level until the 1700s. The cause was not productivity improvements or up-skilling. Unfortunately, the cause was the Black Death, also called the plague, which killed by some estimates more than one-third of the population in Europe. The demand for labour went up and land was redistributed amongst the survivors. The plague is a zoonotic disease. The bacterium is endemic to rodents and carried by the fleas that infest rats. The plague originated in China, was carried west along the Silk Road by traders and spread thence to Europe, most famously, by Italian traders fleeing the Mongol siege of Caffa by ship.</p><p>The Plague destroyed not only populations, but also the existing social and economic order throughout Europe. Governments of the day responded with novel and extreme measures. In England, the Statute of Labourers 1351 made it illegal for workers to demand pay greater than those wages prevailing before the Plague. While there is little evidence it was effective, it appears to have contributed to a major English peasant revolt in 1381. Governments also realised, perhaps belatedly, that inequality itself weakened society\\'s ability to resist the plague. The poor could not afford treatment, but they could pose a risk to all if they contracted it. As a result, towns hired plague doctors to treat rich and poor alike without payment. Necessity is the mother of public health.</p><p>I tell this story in the hope that history does not repeat itself. But it is startling what the parallels are between the plague and COVID-19. The policy questions have changed little over the years. COVID-19 is more than a public health risk: it is a threat to the present global political, economic and social order.</p><p>China\\'s strong policy of containment has essentially decoupled China temporarily from the global economy. Singapore has suffered more than most. In 2018, 3.4 million tourist arrivals – nearly one in five that year – were from China, and China is our largest trading partner. The efforts of Budget 2020 to address the economic impact of COVID-19, and beyond that, to restructure the economy, are timely and I fully support the intent behind them.</p><p>But even if, as we hope, the impact of COVID-19 will be short-lived, it would be irrational to plan to return to the same apparently prosperous world that we inhabited just a few months ago. Countries and companies are assessing whether economies and supply chains should be so tightly coupled. So, for our part, we should take this opportunity to strengthen weaknesses in our economy and society that may yet affect the course of the outbreak and our resilience to future ones.</p><p>International experts, Mr Deputy Speaker, have judged that Singapore\\'s approach to COVID-19 is a model for public health systems worldwide. We should be proud of the hard work that our healthcare and Home Team institutions have put in to protect our society.</p><p>We can afford the tremendous costs of containing COVID-19 because we have a highly successful market-based economy. But there is a paradox there. Our efforts to contain COVID-19 now depend on many people in the frontline who have benefited much less from the market economy than others have. Our efforts also do not depend on the private healthcare sector. They instead depend on the strength of our public healthcare institutions which are paid for outside the market.</p><p>The key contradiction which the present crisis has highlighted is the growing and invidious divergence between market prices and social value. To understand this, we need to deconstruct the ideology or the myth of market forces. In crude terms, the myth is the idea that the price and distribution of goods and services, determined by competitive market processes, must be efficient and socially appropriate. This model of market forces underlies our policy thinking about economic restructuring because for the most part it works well. It is impossible to protect all jobs or industries in economic restructuring, because doing so would cripple the efficiency of the economy and harm ourselves in the long run. However, we should never assume that the market price is equivalent to social value. Market prices may be efficient, but that says little about it being equitable or socially desirable.</p><p>What comes to mind to illustrate this is how the frontlines of our war against COVID-19 have been increasingly manned by people whose market prices are low but social values immeasurable, especially during a public health crisis. Rosalind, one of the cleaners at my University, does more on a daily basis to protect our students and staff from COVID-19 than I possibly can.</p><p>She and her colleagues go into our offices and classrooms and toilets daily to make sure that they are disinfected. The cleaning frequency has been stepped up. She bears the risks of cleaning up dirt and spills and worse things and she has more work now but the same pay. Our Town Councils likewise largely depend on foreign workers and elderly local cleaners who do jobs that few of us would accept for the same pay.</p><p>This disconnect between market prices and social value is not a problem confined to those of the lowest incomes. Security officers put themselves at risk serving quarantine notices and screening for sick persons at our institutions. One such officer did, in fact, contract COVID-19. Our emergency medical responders and nurses put themselves at risk every day as their work puts them in direct physical contact with the sick. And our general practitioners (GPs) are working under very difficult circumstances to screen and treat the sick, to make the judgement call if a patient is a suspect COVID-19 case. Yet, the rewards for GPs have never been very high compared to that for specialists and surgeons, to say nothing of the pay for nurses and first responders. There may be market reasons why elective aesthetic surgery gives a doctor a much better living than primary care, but surely, there are few social reasons why this is so.</p><p>A second reason for interrogating the myth of market forces is that there is no guarantee that market prices and allocations reflect efficiency. In theory, prices in a competitive market track the marginal productivity of any resource closely. This implies the market allocation of resources should be efficient at producing the greatest useful output for society at the least cost. But this need not be true, especially once we consider the importance of resilience in maintaining social functioning in difficult times.&nbsp;</p><p>Market forces have concentrated the production of medical personal protective equipment, such as surgical masks, in a relatively small number of factories worldwide, many of them in China. Medical institutions worldwide do not keep significant reserve stocks because the supply chain is usually swift and reliable. In normal times, yes, the globalised system of production is superbly efficient. We would, in fact, question normally whether it is good value for money if MOH were to start subsidising the costly production of surgical masks in Singapore, or the creation of a stockpile that far exceeds that of projected clinical use. The COVID-19 outbreak, however, demonstrates the limitations of efficiency as the sole judgement criterion.</p><p>The Straits Times reported on 21 February, just last week, that private hospitals in Singapore have seen big drops in foreign patients. Usually, they get about 40,000 medical tourists a month. But now, many have cancelled their appointments. Now, normally, it is a good thing to have a thriving private medical sector in Singapore. It gives patients choice; it makes Singapore a medical hub. But it is likely if the COVID-19 outbreak worsens, that our GPs and public hospitals will continue to be severely stretched with a high caseload while the private specialist sector may well be short of work. This is neither resilient nor efficient. And yet, it is the market outcome, because there is market demand to pay for excess capacity in the private sector. There is none to pay for it in the public sector.</p><p>Our public healthcare system is under pressure, as are healthcare systems worldwide, to be more efficient, to cut waste and slack. To keep public healthcare prices low, we schedule appointments for subsidised healthcare as tightly as possible, to extract the most out of our manpower and equipment. This comes at a hidden cost to the resilience and morale of our healthcare workers. In a crisis, these effects become more salient. Any lack of slack means that in a crisis, we risk&nbsp;having insufficient spare capacity to deal with unexpected surges in demand. We must then rely on our healthcare workers to work overtime to keep us safe.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">China and now Korea’s experience in managing the current crisis are important reminders of how vulnerable our public healthcare system could be. We are just one unlucky \"super spreading\" incident away from severely taxing our public hospitals. To be sure, the Government has done well in planning ahead. The NCID, which has been a mainstay of our fight against COVID-19, is proof that we have taken the lessons of SARS to heart. But we must guard against the short sighted pursuit of efficiency at the expense of resilience. We may have to prepare for a new normal where increased globalisation and the disintegration of public health systems worldwide mean that we will face imported disease outbreaks more frequently than ever before.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Let me now turn to inequality, Mr Deputy Speaker. The COVID-19 outbreak is likely to hurt the livelihoods of those who already live precarious economic lives – the freelancers, the workers in small and medium enterprises. The market forces myth explains inequality through the argument that pay is equal to productivity. This in turn forces us to emphasise improving&nbsp;our productivity in order to raise wages, which in the long run is more sustainable.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">But there are any number of market distortions which would explain why the productivity-to-pay relationship, while it may hold on average and in the long run, does not always hold for the individual or even the sector. In Singapore, wages for low-income workers stagnated for much of the 2000s. The occasional paper on \"Income Growth, Inequality and Mobility Trends in Singapore\" published by MOF in 2015, documents&nbsp;that from 2004 to 2009, cumulative, per-member household income growth was only 4% for the the lowest quintile as opposed to 19.5% for the top quintile.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Were the prices right for low-wage labour in the mid-2000s? If we believe fully in price theory the answer is yes and there is nothing that can be done about it beyond Government support and transfers. But, fortunately, wiser heads prevailed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In 2012, former Chairman of the National Wages Council, Prof Lim Chong Yah, called for \"wage shock therapy\" to raise the wages of bottom income earners while freezing that at the top. While the Government did not agree with Prof Lim\\'s approach to the problem, it nonetheless worked through the tripartite framework to introduce the Progressive Wage Model, which provides an explicit framework for pushing salaries up in key low-wage sectors. We have seen a strong reversal of formerly stagnant wage growth for low-income Singaporeans. As reported in the latest Key Household Income Trends 2019, cumulative real growth in per-household member income was 29.5% and 31.8%, for the first and second deciles, from 2009 to 2019. Top decile income growth, meanwhile, slowed to 15.9%t for the same period.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Does this mean that productivity for low-wage workers has jumped by 30% over the last decade? It is difficult to take at face value without more study the price theory implication that cleaners have suddenly become hugely more productive, even with the benefit of training. I suspect it is more likely that wages were simply too low, possibly because of the easy access back then to low-wage foreign workers and our low-wage workers\\' lack of bargaining power.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In any case, the solution to being a nurse is not for that nurse to become a doctor and the solution for cleaners is not to hope that our children do not have to take up that job or to depend on an inexhaustible supply of low cost foreign labour. Society needs both nurses and doctors, cleaners and lawyers. The solution is to pay and respect low-wage workers better.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Mr Deputy Speaker, in recent days, key corporations in Singapore starting with Temasek Holdings and now including SATS, SMRT and Capitaland, and perhaps more, have decided to restructure and reduce the wages of senior management staff in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. I applaud these moves to demonstrate solidarity with Singaporeans on the ground. They are important not just for the morale of frontline staff, who may yet face cost-cutting, but also sends a signal that the risks and costs of COVID-19 should be socially distributed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Let me suggest that this year, we orient all efforts towards protecting and even increasing the wages of lower paid Singaporeans, and paying for it by restraining and restructuring the wages of those higher up – which would include, I would suggest, hon Members as leaders in their own professions. Today, we commend our cleaners and security guards, nurses and public health workers, for being in the front line of protecting us against COVID-19. We acknowledge the work of our public transport workers, our hawkers and shopkeepers, in keeping our supply lines and life running as normal. Can we give them a tangible increase in their salaries to acknowledge their sacrifices?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If we do not have the words to express our gratitude, then at least, let us have the dollars.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">More fundamentally, COVID-19 and the demands of economic restructuring should have us question whether our social risk sharing institutions, for unemployment, housing and health care, provide sufficient protection and resilience. There was a lively debate yesterday on unemployment insurance in the Chamber and I think the discussion should continue. We cannot depend just on charity for filling in the gaps, especially since charitable activity may also be hurt by an economic or social crisis. In particular, our resilience today to major shocks such as COVID-19 depends very much on the government of the day enacting strong and tailored measures, because we do not have many automatic risk sharing measures in place. This is both a strength and a weakness because resilience depends on the performance of the political leadership of the day. Events near to us show that this cannot be guaranteed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I started this speech by noting how the Black Death fundamentally reshaped economic and social institutions in Europe. The long-run history of economic inequality is that significant reductions have only occurred in the wake of huge disasters such as the Black Death, the collapse of empires, the first and second World Wars. Left unspoken is whether inequality played a role in precipitating these collapses.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">At the moment it seems, if we are fortunate, COVID-19 will only be a shock, not a disaster, for the global economy. But we have to continue the work of strengthening and restructuring our economic, and societal institutions, to ensure that when the next test comes, Singapore will stand as resilient as it has today.&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Government’s Budget.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Senior Parliamentary Secretary Low Yen Ling.</p><h6>4.37 pm</h6><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the emergence of COVID-19 has in recent months, placed several threats in our horizon near and far. However, we take heart that since SARS, we have built up our defences and are better prepared to deal with this virus outbreak today. We are deeply thankful to our healthcare workers, government agencies, cleaners and many frontline personnel who have put their duties first, to protect us.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Apart from these, we have a strong foundation of community help and network to respond to challenges that come our way. Since its formation, the Community Development Councils or CDCs have played a critical role in partnering the community to strengthen bonds and help vulnerable groups. We have the “\"BC\" mission&nbsp;– A stands for Assist the Needy, B stands for Bond the People, C stands for Connect the Community. The mission is even more crucial than ever, in a time like this.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Each of the five CDCs – Central Singapore CDC, led by Mayor Denise Phua; Northeast CDC, led by Mayor Desmond Choo; Northwest CDC, led by Mayor Teo Ho Pin; Southeast CDC, led by Mayor Maliki Osman and Southwest CDC, helmed by myself – each of these five has its own set of local assistance schemes to meet local needs, as well as programmes to foster community development and ownership. A diverse range of partners from the community contribute to improving the welfare of the community and those in need. For example, in 2019, the CDCs rolled out 111 local assistance schemes that benefited close to 156,000 beneficiaries.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has in this year’s Budget, provided $20 million for the CDCs to better meet the needs of their residents through local initiatives. To this end, the five CDCs have been working together to launch an island-wide initiative to provide<strong> </strong>meals in the heartlands for vulnerable families. This effort not only complements the Care and Support package to help Singaporeans who need extra support with the cost of living, it will also bring business to many heartland food joints, coffeeshops which are feeling the effects of the slowdown due to&nbsp;COVID-19.<em> </em></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Yesterday,&nbsp;Member Mr Png Eng Huat had suggested that the grocery vouchers for low-income families be extended for use in small retail shops. In the past few years, our local constituencies have been working with heartland retailers and businesses to meet the nutritional needs of low-income families. The mayors and the CDCs welcome the timely $20 million injection of funds which will provide additional resources for us to scale up these efforts across the nation and reach out to more of those in need, as well as boost the support for local businesses and heartland enterprises.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The upcoming Free Meals and Drinks scheme will be redeemable at participating coffeeshops, participating food courts and participating heartland enterprises. Details are currently being worked out and will be released in due course.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The $20 million Meals in the Heartlands initiative is expected to benefit some 100,000 vulnerable families and each CDC will administer the scheme accordingly to meet the needs of its residents.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, being able to have a decent meal is a form of security and support key to boosting the resilience of families-in-need<em>.</em></p><p>Earlier, Prof Lim Sun Sun also talked about the importance of nutritional meals. These are important for the kids to start the day right. For example, the ability to have a simple breakfast of kaya toast and eggs – whether with Milo for the kids and Kopi-O for the parents – as a family can start the day right, and put parents and kids in a better mood to bond, talk and share. These kinds of moments can often be elusive for those preoccupied in making ends meet. So it is even more important for them to receive greater help in this area.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Taking a ground-up approach, the CDCs will work closely with partners in the community, merchant associations, F&amp;B outlets, self-help groups, SSOs, grassroots leaders and volunteers to form a cohesive network of support to shore up the nutritional, physical and psychological needs of this group of Singaporeans<em>.&nbsp;</em>This win-win solution not only provides businesses with additional revenue during uncertain times, it serves the families in need and brings the community closer together in mutual support.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This type of collaboration benefits the community at large and the CDCs have often involved volunteers and organisations who reach out to those in need. For instance, we have had the Central Singapore Milk fund for children; we have the NorthEast Community Vouchers; we have the NorthWest Food Aid Fund that provides food vouchers, cooked meals and food rations; we have the SouthEast Roxy Family Fund for daily expenses like diapers, food or medicine; and we have Food Connect@SouthWest and Meal Service@SouthWest.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In the coming months, we will see the CDCs widening our outreach and deepening our engagement with partners as we work together to beat the COVID-19 storm. SMEs form the lifeblood in our economy. SMEs make up 99% of our enterprises and SMEs hire close to 70% of employees in Singapore.&nbsp;Since 2013, seven years ago, CDCs have partnered Enterprise Singapore, key trade associations and business chambers to each set up an SME Centre in each of the five CDCs. The SME Centres reach out to heartland enterprises and support them through capability workshops, Government schemes, advisory services and help them improve productivity.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Last year, 6,800 SMEs benefited from the business advisory sessions from the SME@CDC centres and another 2,400 companies took part in 60 capability workshops to enhance their&nbsp;brand, productivity and marketing. The CDCs will continue to do more for our SMEs, as they face the need to constantly evolve, to stay relevant in today’s disruptive climate. From training and talent development, to business advice and community partnerships, we will continue to deepen our efforts with heartland businesses, to energise their growth and survival, for SMEs provide the majority of jobs in Singapore.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Apart from working alongside SMEs, the CDCs are dedicated to improving the future and prospects of Singaporean workers<em>. </em>In 2017, we started SkillsFuture Advice to help Singaporeans navigate their lifelong learning journey and capture opportunities to skill up with courses that they can attend with their SkillsFuture Credits. The CDCs have since surpassed the initial outreach target of 80,000 individuals in three years. By 2019, more than 100,000 Singaporeans have participated in over 3,700 SkillsFuture Workshops in the heartlands, in the community<em>.</em></p><p>Building on this strong foundation, the five CDCs look forward to closer collaborations with SSG, WSG and e2i to expand our SkillsFuture Advice outreach. All five CDCs will intensify our momentum to help Singaporeans, especially mid-career and also mature workers, to be better equipped and resourced to cope with the impact that COVID-19 may have on their careers.&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, please allow me to continue in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Low Yen Ling Budget 27Feb2020-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Neighbourhood shops and micro businesses in the heartlands are important members of our community and are important to the larger community as well. Over time, many residents and shopkeepers have become friends, and the entire neighbourhood feels like a close-knit family.</p><p>The merchants\\' associations are important organisations that represent merchants and they exist in many constituencies. Grassroots organisations, Community Development Councils and various merchant associations have always been in close communication, working together to organise various activities and events to inject vibrancy into the neighbourhoods, boosting pedestrian traffic to bring in more business.</p><p>Here, I will share an example.</p><p>In the Bukit Gombak constituency where I serve, a Chinese New Year event that is similar to the River Hongbao is organised every year. Businesses in the neighbourhood would participate in the CNY bazaar, and there would be large lantern displays and Getai to attract residents to the town centre to shop, eat and enjoy Getai performances. Both residents and neighbourhood merchants benefit from this win-win event, and I know that many constituencies have similar CNY bazaars.&nbsp;</p><p>From this example, we can see that maintaining the vibrancy of communities and neighbourhoods can help to ensure a sustainable business environment for heartland merchants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of funding, besides the $1.6-billion-dollar Care and Support Package, the Government will also set aside $20 million for ComCare schemes under the CDCs. This will allow CDCs to work with neighbourhood merchants to help low income families through their individual platforms. At the same time, this will help to boost residents’ spending at neighbourhood shops and coffee shops. More details will be revealed by the five CDCs soon.&nbsp;</p><p>The mission of the 5 CDCs is to build a caring and cohesive society, and many assistance schemes by the CDCs are people-centred. In 2019, we implemented 111 measures that helped more than 150,000 beneficiaries.</p><p>To better assist our neighbourhood shops in achieving success, the CDCs, Enterprise Singapore, trade associations and merchant associations have banded together to set up SME centres to provide advisory services for heartland merchants. In 2019, about 6,800 shops have made use of this advisory service. Another 2,400 small and micro businesses have also participated in workshops to improve their operations, management and promotion strategies.</p><p>Although large merchants have the advantage of providing new and diversified offerings, neighbourhood merchants have the advantage of providing personalized services, as well as friendships and mutual understanding with customers built over the years. I think this is extremely valuable.</p><p>&nbsp;People say that there will be businesses for shops as long as the community is vibrant. One crucial factor is taking proactive measures to drive customer traffic in the neighbourhood. It is the shared responsibility of everyone to ensure that the community and neighbourhood remain vibrant, to build a pro-people, pro-business and friendly neighbourhood.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the months ahead may hold uncertainties, we can be sure that on the ground, the five CDCs are fortifying the network of support across the heartlands and strengthening our local businesses, our vulnerable families and Singaporean workers. With concerted and specific measures as well as fresh resources, we are closing ranks with fellow Singaporeans and heartland enterprises as well as local businesses.</p><p>As we fight back, as we steady our ship, as we hold our ground, we can get through this together. For no matter what the odds may be, we stand as one – SG United – overcomers, to emerge even stronger.&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support Budget 2020. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><h6>4.51 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, this year’s Budget debate is taking place under the dark clouds caused by a global pandemic. But Singaporeans can take heart that we are better placed than almost any other country to deal with this crisis and to mitigate its impact. The Government has gone all out to address the potential fall-out from COVID-19, and my residents would like to express their thanks to the Government for this Budget and all the help that has been offering. My residents have also asked me to express thanks to our frontline workers whose bravery, commitment and calmness have inspired all of us to carry on.</p><p>However, COVID-19 is a once-in-a-decade threat to the economy and the full effects are not even apparent yet. Even if it does not get worse, it has already blasted a hole in the world’s supply chain. Chinese manufacturers have shut down for a month and many industries are hurt because of lower Chinese demand and because of the broken Chinese supply chain.</p><p>To cushion the impact on local businesses, the Government has introduced a comprehensive set of measures in this year\\'s Budget. Protecting businesses means protecting jobs and protecting families. This is why I support the Government’s efforts to inject additional stimulus in the economy. I am especially appreciative of the Stabilisation and Support Package where $4 billion will be made available to local businesses to tide over short-term dislocations, and the Transformation and Growth Strategy where $8.3 billion will be made available to local businesses to position for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, nevertheless, I would like to make four additional suggestions for the Government to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first point relates to feedback from the SME community. The Stabilisation and Support Package will help small enterprises but it is really too small for medium enterprises. There is a \"sandwich\" class of companies where it is too big for such small help to matter but too small to survive for long periods of negative cash flows. The Corporate Income Tax rebate of 25% of tax payable is a welcome measure, but it is capped at $15,000. This is a small drop in the ocean for such companies. Even a $600,000 loan guarantee by the Government may not be enough for a medium enterprise whose revenue may be up to in the region of $50 million to $100 million a year. I would like to urge the Government to calibrate and scale this assistance according to the size of the company.</p><p>The second question relates to the timing of the help. What can the Government do to speed up cash flow assistance to these companies? It has been almost six weeks since the virus started to impact travel and commerce. Many businesses are already running down on their reserves and they cannot depend on their suppliers to extend credit because their supplies are similarly impacted. Cash flow is the lifeline of every business. From what I heard from the banks, it will take until mid-March to approve new loans and these loans will not be disbursed until mid-April. For some, this will be too late. So, I would like to ask the Government what more can we do to open the spigot to make sure that these companies do not go down because of the virus in the short term.</p><p>The third point relates to what we must do to prevent short-term pain becoming chronic, in the form of long-term unemployment among mature PMETs. If companies go under because of COVID-19, many jobs will disappear and may never come back. Even if they come back, they might on to a different, younger crowd. Employment for mature PMETs exhibits a ratchet effect. It only goes one direction. It is much easier for a mature PMET to lose a job than to be hired back into one.</p><p>So, therefore the emphasis on SkillsFuture 2, SkillsFuture Entreprise Credit and the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package in this year’s Budget is therefore much welcomed. I am also gratified to learn from the Deputy Prime Minister Budget speech that in the last three years, productivity has risen by 2.6% per year and real median income has risen by 3.6% per year. These are positive developments for the Singaporean worker. But I would also like to ask how we can get Singaporeans to do the relevant training, instead of spending their SkillsFuture money on new skills and interests that might not help them to stay employed.&nbsp;</p><p>I totally agree with the Deputy Prime Minister when he said that enterprises know best what are the skills needed for their businesses to transform. But, under the Enhanced Training Support for SMEs, the Government already pays for 90% of the course fee and 80% of worker’s salary while employees are undergoing training. Minister Josephine Teo also said in her speech that funding is not the constraint or the impediment that is preventing workers from getting training. But I know that SMEs are not willing or are unwilling to send their workers because it is just too difficult for them to take their workers away from day-to-day work. Therefore, the new SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit that is capped at $10,000 per year, I feel might see a very low take-up rate.</p><p>I would like to suggest for the Government to intensify efforts to help businesses to find replacement manpower to cover their employees when they are undergoing training. And this might even include having to pay the salary of such temporary replacement. I think this would encourage upskill their workers while not compromising their day-to-day activities.</p><p>Residents have also given feedback that it is difficult to get placement into the Professional Conversion Programmes which operate on a \"place and train\" basis. Place and train means that you have to get placed in a job first before you can undergo training. But it creates a catch-22 situation for mature PMETs. They need the training to get a job, but need to get the job to get the training. So, they are stuck. I would urge the Government to provide more than the hiring incentive of 20% salary, capped at six months that is announced in the Budget, in order to further incentivise companies to make the first move.</p><p>The fourth point is what do we do for the longer term, how do we increase the resilience of our economy and our workforce?&nbsp;A key lesson learnt from the COVID-19 virus is that even when you have money, you cannot buy a mask.&nbsp;Similarly, in the area of manpower, we need to build up our self-sufficiency. We need to reconsider outsourcing.</p><p>I would encourage the Government to identify areas of critical need or essential services, and to build up a core of local talent.&nbsp;The speed and ability of GovTech to swing into action and update from \"gov.sg\" or \"maskgowhere\"&nbsp;is testament that in-house ability matters in times of crisis. Another example would be the need for experienced engineering tech talent, experienced engineering staff during the SMRT crisis in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>It might be cheaper to outsource in the short term, but the strategic value of insourcing would be very apparent and outweigh the cost when disaster hits.</p><p>One way of doing so is to build up a local eco-system of SMEs with the requisite local expertise to operate these industries to become our version of Mittelstand.&nbsp;Germany has its famous Mittelstand&nbsp;– the heart of German industry. The unifying mindset is a focus on social, inter-generational and community responsibility. Mittelstand companies contribute to the local economic and social welfare. They also offer stability and loyalty to their staff by investing heavily in training and retaining staff in times of crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>This stands in contrast to the more common Western style of capitalism, with an exclusive focus on profits.&nbsp;Their overriding obligation is to their shareholders, not to other stakeholders like workers. This \"winner takes all\" mentality might have also contributed to the growing inequality problem that we see in the world today.</p><p>From a societal perspective, it is not always clear that unbridled capitalism will lead to the best outcome. Perhaps it is time for us to explore how we can build a core of locally-anchored, stakeholder-conscious Singapore businesses that can help our economy in both good times and bad times.</p><p>Singapore already has many of the ingredients to cultivate our own Mittelstand eco-system. We are uniquely placed to work together as a government and as a society to achieve a bold vision. Enterprise Singapore and the private sector can work together to identify the right industries. EDB can can bring these businesses to Singapore.</p><p>Innovation can be driven by research and academic institutions, with funding from NRF and RIE, and there can be tripartite collaboration with the unions to make sure that our workers have a voice. Trade associations can also help to mobilise the workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Our emphasis on lifelong learning will provide a skilled workforce of craftsmen and domain experts. Perhaps what we really need is for the Government to invest in a Mittelstand fund or to start a Mittelstand development bank to catalyse the entire SME eco-system. Give it an inspiring name, articulate the bold vision, set an ambitious timeline and make it happen. Let us show our pioneering spirit once again. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Budget.</p><h6>5.02 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this year’s Budget is set in one of the most uncertain times of Singapore’s history. Our economy grew by a modest 0.7% in 2019, its weakest growth since 2008 Financial Crisis.&nbsp;With the current COVID-19 outbreak fast spreading across the world, the outlook for 2020 is even more bleak and uncertain.</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has provided much-needed assurance, by announcing a rock-solid Budget that inspires confidence to press ahead. People say money cannot buy happiness.&nbsp;But I can think of&nbsp;many things money, in the right hands, can provide:&nbsp;peace of mind, opportunities to better one’s circumstances&nbsp;and hope for the future. Budget 2020 offers us that. Let me elaborate.</p><p>Singapore’s economic foundations have been and continue to be strong. The fiscal strength has enabled Deputy Prime Minister to announce one of the most expansionary Budgets in 20 years – $106 billion to support families, seniors, workers and businesses.&nbsp;Budget 2020 will provide \"Stabilisation and Support\" for the current COVID-19 outbreak, enable Singapore to seize opportunities to transform and grow, as well as to build and secure our future.</p><p>The money will come from diversified sources of tax, Net Investment Return Contributions (NIRC) from our reserves as well as accumulated surplus from previous years’ fiscal prudence and discipline. It is at times like these when we really appreciate having this reservoir of financial resources to keep Singapore on an even keel, come what may.</p><p>It is at times like these when we should also reflect on the significant contributions made by NIRC. Its contribution to fund total expenditure has grown from 13% in 2015, it is now 22% in 2020&nbsp;– projected to be 22% in 2020. So, in five short years, it has gone from 13% to 22%. Besides being the single largest source of revenue, NIRC is also projected to grow at 9.3%, compared to only 1.7% total increase in all the taxes in FY2020.</p><p>I am worried about calls from some quarters for the Government to take more from our reserves, rather than to safeguard our strategic \"asset\". Is it not unwise to kill the \"goose that lays the golden egg”?</p><p>I am even more worried about the growing dependency on NIRC. As NIRC, we know, is subject to volatility from tough investment environments, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether it might be prudent to consider setting a threshold on NIRC dependency, beyond which recurrent spending should only be funded through recurrent revenue.</p><p>I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for responding to my call to delay increase in GST.&nbsp;Whilst he has assured us that GST will not increase for at least another two years and has also provided support in the form of GST Assurance Package, some Singaporeans are still wondering why would we need to raise GST at all, given the apparent budget surpluses and additional capacity of $6 billion of GST offsets?&nbsp;Increases in cost of living is foremost in the minds of many people, particularly retirees.</p><p>Sir, I would like to repeat my call to the Deputy Prime Minister to continue looking for other sources of revenue. Even though the wealthy are already contributing substantially to our taxes through a progressive Personal Income Tax, GST, property tax, ABSD and so on, I really believe there is still room to consider wealth tax and estate duties – all aimed at building an even fairer and more equal society.</p><p>Some may be concerned that a re-introduction of estate duties, previously abolished in 2008, may harm Singapore\\'s status as a leading wealth management centre and incentivise wealth and business owners to engage in complex structures for tax avoidance.&nbsp;As other forms of wealth taxation are now being considered by a number of other countries, the notion of wealth taxes generally do give rise to concerns about how taxpayers might react.</p><p>But income and wealth inequality are global issues and there are wide recognition amongst governments and wealth and business owners of the need to address them. As the world moves towards considering broader and fairer tax systems, Singapore should maintain its principles of keeping tax structures simple and tax rates low whilst meeting the interests of all stakeholders, particularly of those who are most in need.</p><p>So, now we live in a new era of automatic information exchange under the Common Reporting Standard and other global requirements to disclose beneficial ownership across the world. Transparency in ownership and value of assets is rapidly becoming a new norm.</p><p>When tax is well structured at competitive and fair rates, together with tax treaties similar to those to which other jurisdictions are parties, an effective estate duty and, perhaps, accompanying wealth tax regime may actually be an allure for assets to be maintained in Singapore.</p><p>In a world of turbulence and uncertainty, Singapore\\'s world class infrastructure, rule of law, financial and political stability is priceless for the peace of mind of the wealthy. This is especially so when the environment in Hong Kong, Asia\\'s other leading wealth management centre, has been marred by months of street protests and instability, and long-term uncertainties regarding its tax and legal systems.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister Heng for a very generous Budget with measures to help with cost of living, training, jobs and retirement adequacy. Whilst there is a really \"feel good\" sentiment on the ground, more needs to be done to help Singaporeans understand exactly how these measures will benefit them. And I am picking this up when I am on the ground trying to explain.</p><p>There are many different schemes to keep track of, from the new schemes such as Care and Support Package, Matched Retirement Savings Scheme, GST Assurance Package; to enhancements to existing programmes such as the Silver Support Scheme and SkillsFuture top-ups. On top of existing support programmes, they all have very different qualifying criteria, some based on housing type, individual income, household income, age criteria and often combinations of criteria.</p><p>And I do agree these multi-faceted targeted schemes are more cost effective than broad based ones, but together they can become too complex for the average person on the street to digest.&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Government provide a Personalised Budget Statement or make available a Budget Calculator on how Singaporeans and their family, based on their unique circumstances, can stand to benefit from Budget 2020.</p><p>Sir, regarding support for businesses, I urge the Deputy Prime Minister Heng to really stand ready to do more. The coronavirus outbreak has hit the businesses hard. The general feedback is that many businesses are experiencing up to 50% drop from their usual volume, and the Budget measures are too small and too short term to address these challenges.</p><p>Besides the dramatic impact on tourism, aviation and retail sectors, COVID-19 has significantly disrupted supply chains in manufacturing to even vegetables for the restaurants. Locked-down Chinese cities are unable to supply the parts that&nbsp;have become integral components of the supply chains here. Many workers are stuck in&nbsp;China, unable to return.&nbsp;Activation of Business Continuity Plans, extra cleaning, medical leave, leave of absence and so on have put additional pressure on costs and manpower.</p><p>It will be especially crucial, I agree with Member Ong Teng Koon, to provide relief for cash flows to tide them over this difficult period. With $7.7 billion of budget surplus left for this term of government to tap on, Deputy Prime Minister Heng has ample ammunition to do more, I hope. I would like to ask if he would consider a second package if circumstances warrant it?</p><p>Would the Deputy Prime Minister consider extending the Jobs Support Scheme to six months and increase offset of wages to 12%, as what was done during the Global Financial Crisis? Would he consider extending the support package to more sectors?&nbsp;Would he also consider coordinating efforts with banks to restructure loans, so that SMEs and affected individuals can get moratorium on repayments for, say, up to six months, just to ease the cashflow?</p><p>In the meantime, it is heartening to see large corporations and landlords rise to the occasion in support of the smaller ones – including rental rebates by Changi Airport Group to retailers and the Hope fund, put together by the Young Business Leaders of SBF, to support SMEs with immediate working capital. This is the time for the big boys to chip in and help their smaller brothers.</p><p>Sir, long-term transformation and growth remain the key focus of this Budget. The issue of manpower constraint continues to be a major struggle for businesses across the board, even as we are resolved to reducing our dependency on foreign workers. We need to urgently develop new ways to find, train and retain the talent necessary to sustain growth.</p><p>Learning from the Swiss, industry associations can play a pivotal role in galvanising players in the sector to join forces in curating and delivering impactful training for the industry. I believe that Singaporeans will become more accepting of supplementary foreign labour if we actualise the systematic plan to train and develop them for attractive careers.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, finally, Budget 2020 showcases Singapore\\'s capacity to build a bright and sustainable future. Deputy Prime Minister had set ambitious goal to tackle climate change and has put aside a $5 billion Coastal and Flood Protection Fund. The spark in Singapore\\'s climate change journey has been lit in this Budget. Singaporeans can look forward to a sustainable future and participate in exciting new developments as we manage Singapore\\'s transition to a low carbon, low emissions, clean economy.</p><p>In conclusion, Budget 2020 inspires confidence in uncertain times.&nbsp;It has provided Singaporeans&nbsp;with peace of mind, ample opportunities and a sustainable future. The concerns over COVID-19 will eventually fade over time, but the efforts to transform Singapore as a Global-Asia Node of Technology, Innovation and Enterprise will ensure Singapore remains exceptional. I cannot agree more with the Deputy Prime Minister Heng, when he says that the Singapore Spirit is strong and growing. Together, we will advance, as One Singapore. I support the Budget.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker:&nbsp;</strong>Mr Christopher de Souza.</p><h6>5.15 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I had my speech finalised on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, I found out that I was speaker number 48 out of 48. What can you say after a list of 47 esteemed speakers? So, I decided to rework my speech.</p><p>The past two days\\' speeches&nbsp;– many made passionately&nbsp;– reminded me of a BBC documentary which I had listened to last month while I was on the way to work. The documentary was called \"disagreeing better\". No. It was not a guide about how to better disagreements. Rather, it was a guide about how to resolve disagreements better. Hence, the title \"disagreeing better\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Why is this relevant at all? Because the documentary touched on the negative repercussions on societies when they are polarised. The danger the BCC documentary sought to point out is the very danger so many of us in this House seek to battle. In short, in Singapore, we do things quite differently. We seek unity here. Hence, the Unity Budget.</p><p>Why is this important, especially at this time? Because the crisis can bring out the best or the worst in society.&nbsp;</p><p>Will there be disagreements along the way? Of course. These will relate to fiscal measures, social policy and issues of societal values. But how we resolve these differences – and come out of a large crisis or mini crisis – is key. The willingness to listen, to be open with each other, to share and risk empathy; and then to decide. These are all essential for an efficient decision-making body and have been so aptly displayed by so many of the 47 speakers before me. So many of us in the Chamber regard the unity of Singapore and the united response to the crisis as the priority.</p><p>Ms Jessica Tan gave real life examples from her constituency as to why providing opportunities in education is key. Ms Denise Phua shared how these opportunities should be extended to SMEs. Mr Desmond Choo talked about giving working mothers and mothers on maternity the best shot in their careers.&nbsp;</p><p>And you see characteristics of each in Budget 2020 – the umbrella of opportunities for re-skilling, re-training and advancement for the Singaporean workforce. You see the undercurrent of unity in so many of the speeches. You see that in Mr Png Eng Huat\\'s speech where he talked about the need to unite rather than point fingers and stigmatise, how we should not ostracise China, and that it was good that we sent them a second humanitarian shipment.</p><p>So, the BBC documentary sought to point to the danger of disunity. Yet, in this House, through the 47 speeches before me, you see an over-arching priority to unite, and I think that is quite novel in the world today. And it is, in fact, inspiring and encouraging. Hence, Unity Budget.&nbsp;</p><p>If we look at the globe, there is sectarianism, I versus you, hardly any effort to build the common ground or common paths forward. Yet, so many of the speeches in this debate here have had as their foundation the topic of unity.</p><p>But it is not only about unity. There is also the need for transparency, honesty – as Mr Cedric Foo emphasised; and being open with difficult facts too. A \"framework of honesty\", if you like. And I see how that framework is being deployed in the Budget. For example, being upfront with Singaporeans early about the future hike in GST, being open about why over reliance on the NIRC may not be fiscally prudent and why at this stage, we need to think of raising GST in the future.</p><p>This is being open and mature. It makes for the politics of trust and honesty. It makes for a reliable decision-making process.</p><p>If I may be bold enough to say, it is the same framework that we see being deployed within the COVID-19 taskforce – sharing the infections numbers, the discharged numbers, the ICU numbers, sharing information about the clusters and importantly, readying Singaporeans for the method we will use to deal with the virus in the longer time, whichever of the scenarios plays out.&nbsp;</p><p>So, as with Budget 2020, as with the debate of the 47 speakers before me, as with the manner in which the Ministerial taskforce in COVID-19 is addressing the difficulties facing our country today – facts discussed candidly and openly, and a sharing of ideas and suggestions and then, importantly, decisions. This is what we are doing in this Chamber. This is our Singapore way.&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore is like a steady ship in the ocean. We have gone through storms together before and we can go through them again.</p><p>Perhaps, in this moment of the COVID-19 outbreak, we should also take the opportunity to try to remove the hierarchical way that some in our society view jobs and professions, with certain professions viewed as more prestigious while others jobs viewed as less dignified. In my view, such stratification is not the way it should be. This was also a point raised by Prof Yaacob and Mr Alex Yam, and I agree with them. If anything, the COVID-19 crisis is proof to all of us that everyone is important – everyone has a role to play – everyone is needed.</p><p>&nbsp;Allow me to explain. In order to stem the spread of the&nbsp;COVID-19 virus, office buildings carry out temperature taking. Those manning the temperature booths, often security guards, are important as they provide a first line of defence. But the guards are putting themselves at risk. Other measures that have been taken are the increased cleaning and disinfecting of places, such as playgrounds and high touch points, such as lifts and hotel rooms. Our housekeeping staff, uncles and aunties in the hotel industries, frontline staff, cleaners – they all play such an important role in the prevention of the spread of the virus. Many have had to work overtime due to the crisis to meet the increased rate of cleaning common areas. And yes, these diligent and determined workers also put themselves at risk.</p><p>In a Straits Times\\' interview entitled, \"Coronavirus: It’s a dirty job,&nbsp;but if I don’t do it, who will?\", one of the cleaning companies has had their teams work seven days a week these few weeks, all hands on deck, including the manager Mdm Tay. I quote from the article, \"Few Singaporeans are interested in working in the cleaning industry, but Madam Tay hopes that through the work they do – especially during this outbreak – people will learn to respect the job. We are helping to prevent the spread of the virus in Singapore\\'.\", says Mdm Tay.</p><p>The immigration officers are on the front line, so are the enforcement operations managers of MOM. The nurses and those working at the service counters at hospitals and healthcare institutions play a crucial and important role. Their professionalism is inspiring.&nbsp;</p><p>All workers on the frontline should be appreciated. None of us asked for this to happen. None of us want this to happen. But since it has happened, we need all hands on deck. There should be an appreciation that everyone, even those who play less visible roles, are important to our society. We should be less focused on hierarchy and more focused on appreciating each member of our society, especially as we battle COVID-19 in a singular and united determination. And I hope that we will also retain this experience, that everyone in our society is important, even after we overcome this crisis, as we forge our collective future.</p><p>Sir, even as we are in a ship together, we need to ensure that the Budget has in place measures that are of practical help to our people.&nbsp;This is especially important to the hotel, tourism and food and beverage industry. According to a snap survey done by Restaurant Association Singapore, close to 60% of restaurants in Singapore stated that they are not prepared and equipped enough to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 on their operations. For those who rely heavily on tourists, the estimated loss could go up to 80%.</p><p>To help the food and services sector during this period, the Adapt and Grow initiative was expanded. In relation to rental costs, for food and beverage and retailers, it is good that there are full month rental waivers for some hawkers and half a month of rental waivers for commercial tenants of Government agencies. However, for those on private property, it is the landlords of those retailers on private properties who are given property tax rebates and encouraged to pass on to the retailers.&nbsp;Instead of relying on the goodwill of landlords to pass on savings to their lessees, is there no other more direct way we can alleviate the challenges that those in the food and beverage industry are facing? For example, will the Ministry consider requiring landlords to declare whether they have passed on the rebate to their lessees? And if so, how much has been passed down in dollar terms? Already, it has been reported by the Restaurant Association Singapore that 200,000 employees have been affected since the outbreak.</p><p>As Business Continuity Plans already need to be in place, it may also be a good opportunity for businesses to test and hopefully prove that flexible working arrangements work. If it works, more firms may be ready and confident to try adopting it as an available standard practice to support our working parents with\\tyoung children\\tand working care-givers. For\\tsome\\tof the enterprises who want to take this opportunity to change the way they work, this Enterprise SkillsFuture Credit&nbsp;may come in useful.</p><p>Furthermore, in relation to using this crisis as a place to plan for the future, there is one particular area that we have announced our intention to look for new sources of\\tsupply\\tand look into the capabilities\\tfor\\tlocal manufacturing, that, is, masks. It would be especially useful since epidemics will spread between countries more quickly. But the issue of masks\\talso points to a larger priority, namely, the diversification of our supply sources.</p><p>I have spoken\\tabout\\tfood security before.\\tCurrently, the coronavirus or COVID-19 is affecting the world\\ttrade of\\tgoods\\tand supplies.</p><p>In light of this, we need to take stock of what other items, besides masks, we potentially need to&nbsp;manufacture on our own in the future, and if we do&nbsp;manufacture them, whether our supply sources for the materials are sufficiently diverse.</p><p>Secondly, for our businesses who are facing problems with diversification of supply sources, what support from the Government is available for them to facilitate the making and establishing of connections with more diverse trade partners?</p><p>Budget 2020 also has its eye on the future.\\tBusinesses&nbsp;have\\tbeen\\tgiven\\tincentive\\tmeasures\\tto\\ttake\\tthis opportunity to re-skill and re-train workers to increase future productivity. We also need, however, to instill measures that make learning something that is embedded in the way things are done in Singapore, long term. This is crucial as we are facing an economy characterised by disruptive technology. Change will come. Just like COVID-19 presented itself to us as a disruption, or another phrase by Deputy Prime Minister Heng, as \"a spur and a test\" that COVID-19 has presented to us, we cannot run away from such a change, disruption, spur or test.</p><p>We need to change the way we think about learning. Year after year, we cite the Chinese saying, live until old, learn until old, that is, lifelong learning. We learn that in Primary schools too. But, do we really live it? Do we see learning as a chore rather than a joy? Do we see learning as a burden rather than a privilege? I would like to suggest that we think about the way we can build lifelong learning into the curriculum of students. It is not just a good attitude to have in life but necessary in the kind of economy&nbsp;Singaporeans will face in the future.</p><p>A good example of what could be done is what is already being done at SMU. We could broaden what is being done at SMU.</p><p>At SMU, disruption is built into part of the syllabus through the way the core curriculum is designed. The core curriculum has three pillars: capabilities, communities and civilisations.</p><p>Under capabilities, students pick up skills, such as numeracy and management lessons, to navigate the modern world. Internships are integrated with the other pillars, with a work-study scheme available so students can take up longer internships and earn credits at the same time. Under communities, students discover Singapore\\'s Asian context through courses under the areas of economy and society, technology and society, cultures of the modern world and community service.&nbsp;</p><p>SMU\\'s core curriculum was designed to nurture a generation of \"adaptive and adroit graduates who are technically competent and agile, socially conscious and adept in their communities and inspired by the timeless puzzles and challenges confronting humanity.\" This instills in students the aptitude for and attitude of lifelong learning. That is something other schools could consider so that the students will not be theorists only but be able to handle both theory and practical, having the dexterity&nbsp;to apply strong foundations of theory into new real-world applications.</p><p>Sir, I move on to my third and last topic&nbsp;– climate change –\\tand why I stand in strong support of the $5 billion set aside to shore up our coastal defences.</p><p>Although there are some in Singapore who disagree with the use of the phrase \"climate change\" as they are of the view that the climate is and always has been changing, allow me to just use the phrase to point out some trends we should be concerned with, particularly relating to the rise in sea levels. Historical data measuring average sea levels of the Singapore Strait from four research-quality data points at Tanjong Pagar, Raffles Lighthouse, Sultan Shoal and Sembawang, indicate that there was a 2.9 mm yearly increase of our sea levels from 1984 to 2011. So, sea levels have risen and ice in the ocean has been melting and physics will say that there will be an increase in sea levels.</p><p>What this means is that low-lying small nations such as the Maldives and Tuvalu may face, or in fact, are facing existential crisis.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr de Souza, you have three minutes more.</p><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza</strong>: I will take two, Sir. Leaving one spare. Thank you.</p><p>Because of the dire consequences rising sea levels have on Singapore\\'s future, it is good that the Budget takes these longer term challenges into account and prepares for them. The $5 billion investment to ameliorate the effect that sea levels have on Singapore is thus commendable and far-sighted.&nbsp;</p><p>In my speech, Sir, I compared Singapore to a steady ship in the ocean. As a country, we have weathered storms together.\\tThe Budget Statement and the debate on it are important to train our focus on how to ensure we get through the storm as one united people. As Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat wrote in his Facebook the day before he delivered the speech, \"we\\twould not\\thave\\tbeen\\table\\tto\\tact\\tquickly\\tand decisively, if not for our deep reserves. I do not mean only our financial reserves... I also mean the reserves of\\tstrength,\\tresilience,\\tempathy and resourcefulness among our public servants and fellow Singaporeans\".</p><p>It is such resilience that allows us to plan well into the future, well beyond this storm. It is our Singapore way –\\tresponding as one people, tirelessly safeguarding our country’s reserves and future. It is for these reasons, that I stand in support of the Motion.&nbsp;[<em>Applause</em>.]</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Leader of the House.</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>2 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) for each month from 1 January 2018, how many cars have been registered under the Vehicle Emission Schemes in the A1, A2, B, C1 and C2 bands respectively; and (b) whether the Ministry will start collecting such data if it does not currently do so.</p><p><strong>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;The Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES) has been implemented for all new cars, taxis and newly imported cars since January 2018. It assesses vehicles on five key pollutants – carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM).

Among these older drivers who wish to drive a taxi, LTA requires them to also pass a medical examination with additional occupation-related health checks to certify their fitness to renew their Taxi Driver Vocational Licences (TDVL). We subject taxi drivers to more stringent medical assessment as they clock a much higher mileage than other motorists. This is to protect the commuting public.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;</span>LTA is working with the Traffic Police to align the two medical assessment processes. Before the end of this year, taxi drivers who have passed their TDVL medical assessments should be able to use them to renew their Class 3 personal driving licences.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>: Thank you, Sir. I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State. I am very happy to hear that these will be aligned. It will definitely cost less to our residents. I have two supplementary questions.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">According to my resident, for Class 4 and 5, Traffic Police\\'s enhanced Heavy Vehicle Proficiency Test fee is about $450. LTA\\'s enhanced Taxi Driver\\'s Vocational Licence test is $136. Both require separate medical examinations for both licence-holders aged 69 to 74 years. Residents feel that this is very expensive, very heavy on them. I welcome the alignment and I would also like to urge that the test fee can be further reduced. Four hundred fifty dollars is very high to many of them.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The second question is, at this difficult period of the COVID-19 crisis, would the Ministry work with taxi companies to work on rental reduction? Many of them have given feedback that their incomes have been reduced by as much as 50%.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Mr Speaker, for the test fees, we are continually looking at the process of how we do these medical assessments. We will take the test fees into consideration. I thank the Member for her suggestion. We will have a look at this.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In terms of the broader issue of the taxi operators, we have announced some measures to help the taxi industry&nbsp;– some are directed at the drivers and some are directed at the operators. We will continue to work closely with the association, in line with the tripartite model, to look and see what is the effectiveness of the interventions we put in place and to see whether or not further interventions are necessary.</p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>2 <strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Home Affairs (a) in the past year, how many people have been penalised for jaywalking; (b) how does the Ministry monitor areas where jaywalking is prevalent; (c) how many fatal traffic accidents were caused by jaywalking in the past three years; (d) whether the Ministry plans to implement additional measures to reduce the danger of fatal traffic accidents to the elderly who jaywalk; and (e) whether there is a need to review the current penalties to deter jaywalking.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tThe Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Ms Sun Xueling) (for the Minister for Home Affairs)</strong>:&nbsp;In 2019, Traffic Police (TP) detected about 2,500 jaywalking violations. From 2017 to 2019, there were 59 fatal traffic accidents involving jaywalkers. Elderly jaywalkers were involved in about 68% of them.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In recent years, TP have stepped up its engagement of elderly pedestrians. In 2019, TP organised the Road Safety Carnival themed \"Be Seen, Be Safe\" for more than 1,000 senior citizens, to raise awareness on the importance of using designated pedestrian crossings and how to cross roads safely. This year, TP will be working with the Lion Befrienders Service Association and NTUC Health Co-operative Limited to train staff and volunteers to become Road Safety Champions to engage senior citizens on road safety.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">To further improve safety for elderly pedestrians, LTA has implemented Silver Zones at locations with a high proportion of senior residents, and where there have been accidents involving seniors. Silver Zones have senior-friendly road safety features, such as rest points for pedestrians along road dividers and signs to alert motorists of the presence of elderly pedestrians. LTA plans to increase the number of Silver Zones from 17 in 2019 to 50 by 2023.</p><p>TP regularly conducts enforcement operations at accident-prone locations and jaywalking hot-spots. Under the Road Traffic Act, it is an offence for pedestrians to fail to cross at a pedestrian crossing. The composition sum for this offence was raised from $20 to $50 on 1 April 2019. We will monitor the situation and consider further measures if necessary.</p><p><strong>\\tEr Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>: I do not have five supplementary questions, but I have two. When I first came to Singapore, many of my cousins told me, \"Don\\'t jaywalk. You have to cross by following traffic rules. Otherwise, Police will catch you and will fine you.\" And therefore, I am very law-abiding. But today, I cannot say the same thing to the visitors to Singapore because you can see jaywalkers everywhere. It is so common. To many of us, we feel that there is no enforcement or very little enforcement. Will Ministry step up enforcement and whether it will use technology, for example, CCTV, facial recognition, especially at those locations that have had fatal accidents? The Senior Parliamentary Secretary mentioned just now 59 fatal accidents involving jaywalkers. That is very many.</p><p>The second question is, I also have residents who give feedback that increasingly, that when pedestrians cross the roads, their eyes are glued to the phone. Currently, we know that this is not enforceable. I would like to ask whether this is dangerous and if there is any action to be taken.</p><p><strong>\\tMs Sun Xueling</strong>: I thank the Member for her follow-up questions. As I had mentioned in my earlier reply, definitely, more education, more outreach will be conducted by TP. I have spoken about the \"Be Seen, Be Safe\" campaign. We will also be working with more community outreach organisations such as Lion Befrienders and NTUC Health Co-operative. The Member mentioned that, anecdotally, she sees on the roads is that there are more and more jaywalkers. We are aligned in wanting to deter pedestrians from jaywalking because it definitely causes a danger to themselves. So, we have to find effective ways of reaching out to them to tell them that this is dangerous for them. They can cause harm to themselves; they can also cause harm to motorists, who might have to suddenly swerve to avoid them and they might get into accidents.&nbsp;So, definitely, we are aligned in that we need to conduct more education and outreach efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>On enforcement, I hear what the Member has said about increasing enforcement. When there is feedback about jaywalking hot-spots, TP would intensify their operations as and when they hear feedback from the ground regarding this. On the use of CCTV and technological means, for these to be effective, as the Member mentioned, there needs to be the use of facial recognition technology. There is some feedback from the ground that the use of such technology can be quite invasive. So, while we are definitely considering it, I think we also have to be mindful that too much use of such technology may cause discomfort on the ground as well. Dr Yaacob in his Budget debate speech also talked about whether or not there needs to be a community conversation around the use of technology in public spaces.</p><p>We will bear in mind what the Member has mentioned and continuously look at better ways to conduct enforcement as well as education outreach efforts.</p><p>The Member\\'s second question was&nbsp;—</p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>: Pedestrians crossing the road and their eyes are glued to their mobile phones.</p><p><strong>\\tMs Sun Xueling</strong>: Yes. So, that would be part and parcel of our education outreach efforts. It is not just about using your mobile phone when crossing the road. Even using your mobile phone while going up an escalator can be dangerous. When we reach out to pedestrians, especially when they are on the roads, and in this case, we are talking about elderly pedestrians, then, all the more, they need to be mindful of their surroundings. Having their eyes glued to the mobile phone is definitely a dangerous thing to do when they are crossing the road.</p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">3 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister whether the Government will consider increasing the period during which Government-Paid Paternity Leave may be consumed from within 12 months of childbirth to within 24 months of childbirth.</p><p><strong>\\tThe Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs (Mrs Josephine Teo) (for the Prime Minister)</strong>: Mr Speaker,&nbsp;fathers play an important role in their children\\'s care and development. For this reason, we have progressively increased parental leave provisions to support fathers in caring for their children. Today, fathers can tap on up to eight weeks of leave in the year after their child\\'s birth, including two weeks of paternity leave and four weeks of shared parental leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to maternity leave, paternity leave should be consumed within 12 months of childbirth, as it is meant to support working fathers in caring for their infants when they are younger and in need of more care. For this reason, we have no plans to extend it to 24 months of childbirth. This is also in line with international practice where parents are typically required to consume maternity and paternity leave within a few months or up to a year after the child\\'s birth. This is the practice in many countries such as Denmark, United Kingdom and South Korea.</p><p>&nbsp;After the child turns one, parents can continue to tap on other forms of leave support. This includes six days of unpaid infant care leave per parent per year until the child turns two, on top of six days of paid childcare leave, which each parent can take annually until the child turns seven. Together with tripartite partners, we also encourage employers to provide up to four weeks of unpaid leave per year if their employees have children below two years old who need more care, for example, due to medical conditions. This is a provision under the Tripartite Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, which I must thank the Member Mr Louis Ng for helping to bring about.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;Beyond leave provisions, the Government will continue to work with employers to better support parents in managing their work and family responsibilities. This includes promoting the adoption of flexible work arrangements and encouraging more family-friendly practices at workplaces.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Ng.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: Thank you, Sir. I thank the Minister for the reply. I think what was shocking for me was that in 2018, 65% of fathers in Singapore did not even take one day of paternity leave. I am just wondering whether the Ministry is looking into this further, whether we are looking at Denmark, UK and South Korea&nbsp;– the three countries that the Minister mentioned&nbsp;– what is the take-up rates of paternity leave there and what are they doing that can help increase our take-up of paternity leave.</p><p>The second clarification is a suggestion, actually. I understand the default arrangement now is that the fathers have to take their paternity leave within 16 weeks of child birth and he has to take it in a two-week continuous block. For any other arrangement, they would need the employers\\' consent. I am just wondering whether we can make the default arrangement that the fathers can take it anytime within the 12 months of child birth and they do not need to take it in a continuous block. Maybe then, there will be an increase in the number of fathers taking up the paternity leave.</p><p><strong>\\tMrs Josephine Teo</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary questions. The figure of 65%, if I recall correctly, is within a certain period of reporting. What happens is that you need the employers to have submitted the claims in order for the true picture to emerge. So, usually, fathers have one year after the child\\'s birth to take leave and employers have three months after the fathers take leave to submit the claims. So, I would take that 65% in context.</p><p>The Member asked about the experience in other countries. It is actually very interesting.&nbsp;I still recall visiting Denmark, one of the Nordic countries that is very well-known for its family-friendly policies as well as, overall, very strong support for parenthood. If my memory serves me right, I was myself, quite surprised that their paternity leave utilisation was just about 70%, not higher than that. So, I asked my counterpart to explain to me why this was so. I recall quite distinctly being told that even in a country like Denmark, there are certain sectors, where it is just not considered at the workplace to be very acceptable for the man to go on paternity leave. That is the reason why, even for them, the paternity leave is not closer to 100%.&nbsp;</p><p>It is quite the case for also a country like South Korea. Paternity leave utilisation is around 3%, very low.</p><p>What these countries experiences suggest to us is that workplace norms, how accepting the co-workers are and also the employers are, for paternity leave utilisation, that is still something that is being worked on.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Singapore context, actually we have been making very good progress. Today, the paternity leave utilisation is about 53%, that is not too bad. Within the public sector, the utilisation rate is even higher, about 84%. So, within the public sector, the utilisation already surpasses some of the Nordic countries.</p><p>What can we do? I think a change of norms, which is something I see happening to a very large extent. You see very many more fathers are involved in the raising of their children. Can we encourage employers to be even more supportive? I think the answer is yes.</p><p>If I may just make an observation. This is, I think the fifth time you have asked the question about paternity leave in as many months. So, we are happy to answer your slightly different questions. I hope that you are equally happy with our slightly different answers. During the COS, where we get a chance to deal with marriage and parenthood in a more comprehensive manner, I think we can have a fuller exchange. So, I seek the Member\\'s indulgence for us to take the rest of your questions together in the COS.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\\tMr Speaker</strong>: Order. End of question time.</p>',\n",

(proc text)]</p><p>[(proc text) Question again proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>12.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the budget and I applaud what is being done for Singaporeans in this COVID-19 situation. I dedicate my speech today to two important issues close to my heart, care-giving and ending sexual violence. It is my hope in 2020 that we dedicate more attention to addressing these critical issues and make greater strides towards a more inclusive society and a safer society for all.</p><p>Today, my parents are 65. They lead active lives, but ten years down the road, their lives could possibly be very different as they enter their golden years. As a child to my ageing parents, the prospect of assuming some care-giving responsibilities sometime in the near future weighs on my mind. I am hardly alone in this. Around me,&nbsp;peers of my age share similar concerns. The old age dependency ratio in Singapore has been declining over the decades. In 1990, it was 10.5 younger person to an elderly person. In 2019, the ratio has halved to 4.5. As our loved ones grow older, there are fewer of us to share the labour and responsibilities of care-giving with.</p><p>How will we continue to lead the lives we have when we potentially also have to be care-givers? Would our work schedules allow us to juggle work and care? Would we be able to afford hiring professional help? What other options are there for our parents to age with dignity?</p><p>For women, the pressures are felt even more acutely as societal norms continue to promote care-giving as women\\'s responsibility. A 2011 national survey on care-giving for elderly individuals, those above 75 years old, requiring help with at least one activity of daily living found that 97.9% of all informal care-givers in Singapore are immediate family members, with more of them being female and between 45 and 59 years old. The female care-givers are also usually wives or adult daughters of the care recipient.</p><p>The pressure on women to be care-givers has a great impact on their ability to engage in paid work. In 2018, over 280,000 women were outside the labour force primarily because of care-giving to relatives or family members apart from children. In comparison, just over 15,000 men cited the same reason for being outside the labour force. The compromises that women make to their work lives negatively impacts their financial security. According to CPF statistics, about four in 10 active CPF members who turned 55 in 2017 did not meet the Basic Retirement Sum (BRS) of $83,000 in their Retirement Accounts.</p><p>Among them, women have more difficulty meeting the BRS. Similarly, a recent study shows that female family care-givers to older persons experienced a change in work situation because of care-giving, suffering a 63% loss in income on average which translated into an average annual loss of more than $50,000.</p><p>Ask any care-giver around you and you will know that it demands a great deal of energy, time, resources and attention. You could find yourself waking up several times throughout the night to attend to your loved ones\\' needs, or having to spend hours persuading them to take their medication, or even straining your back trying to physically move them. For the hundreds of thousands of care-givers out there, stress, burnout and feelings of resentment may not be uncommon. Not only do they have to contend with the physical stress of care-giving, they are also struggling to balance the demands of paid work and dealing with care-related expenses which they are also now responsible for.</p><p>When you become a care-giver, it very often becomes the central identity and the focal point of your life, and you find that the other aspects of your life: your job, your friends, your hobbies, your leisure time, have to accommodate care-giving, not the other way around.</p><p>How can we better redistribute care-giving responsibilities between men and women, but also between the family, community and state? How can we as a society ensure that care-givers are not compromising on their own health and financial security as they carry out this often invisible and thankless work?</p><p>Over the years, the Government has introduced numerous policies to support family care-givers, including most recently the Caregiver Support Action Plan. Many of these initiatives, such as the subsidies for long-term care services and foreign domestic worker levy, have no doubt been of tremendous help to those who benefited from them. However, I believe that our efforts can still be strengthened and would call for even bolder moves.</p><p>To start, we need up-to-date and more robust data on care-givers in Singapore. The last national survey on informal care-giving was conducted almost a decade ago. There should be regular systematic tracking of the number of care-givers in order to understand the scale of challenges they are facing.</p><p>Next, I highlight two workplace policy suggestions that have been raised by various experts and civil society organisations like the Singapore Alliance of Women in Ageing.</p><p>Workplaces need to accommodate care, not the other way around when we recognise and accept the fact that all workers, including those who are employers, will likely find themselves with care-giving responsibilities at some point in their lives. Can we consider legislating the right for employees to request for Flexible Work Arrangements (FWA)? Such legislation has already been successfully introduced in the UK, New Zealand, Canada and Australia.</p><p>Research shows that current utilisation of flexible work arrangements is low due to bias by middle management and requirements for \"facetime\" at the office for performance appraisal, bias against part-timers and reluctance to change the status quo. Without equal mandated access, those most in need, like care-givers, are likely to be denied access to FWA and will have no choice but to exit the workforce.</p><p>Second, childcare leave should be converted to family care leave so that all workers have the option to utilise it for their dependents. Those with children and other older dependents should be given a longer quantum of leave. Unpaid care-giving leave is not sufficient for care-givers as they must use up their own personal and medical leave, leading to care-giver burnout and health problems. Currently, family leave that allows for care-giving of relatives is voluntary, unlike childcare leave that is mandated at six days paid per parent for Singapore Citizens.</p><p>In 2018, only 20% of companies offered some type of paid family care leave. Finally, we need to continue expanding care options. Whether it is through hiring a professional homecare nurse, going to a daycare centre or living in a retirement home. We need to make these options affordable for families. According to a local study, they found that lower, middle-income households would spend between 23% and 59% of their household income on long-term care services after subsidies. The figures are 24% to 63% for upper middle income households. I hope the Government can review the subsidies system to ensure that the cost of these services are not prohibitively high to families, including middle income ones.</p><p>On to the next topic, having just graduated from SMU in the recent years, I am particularly concerned about the recent spate in campus sexual violence cases as well as how the use of technology has enabled new forms of sexual violence to be committed. This next part of my speech would focus on how we can better address these two forms of violence. But first, I would stress the importance that sex education plays in ending violence against women.</p><p>Efforts to address sexual violence are usually focused on legislation, punishment and remedying the effects for survivors. However, there is a crucial need to address social norms and attitudes which enable sexual violence. The prevalence of sexual violence, committed overwhelmingly by men against women, reveals an ugly truth about the way society views women: that women are not human. Sexual violence is fundamentally rooted in the idea that women are objects, devoid of agency, rights and feelings, that women exist for men\\'s pleasure, that women are not equal to men.</p><p>Education on consent, sexual violence, gender equality, is therefore absolutely necessary to transform society\\'s understanding and views for the better. In this vein, I believe that the sexuality education children and young persons receive in schools is a powerful tool to catalyse change from young.</p><p>Is the current sexuality education curriculum reflective of and relatable to young people\\'s experiences with sex, sexuality and gender-based violence today? Are students themselves consulted to find what they need and want to learn from sexuality education? What needs and gaps in knowledge do they have that are not being met by the curriculum?</p><p>According to the United Nations, comprehensive sexuality education, apart from providing scientifically accurate information about sexual and reproductive health, also importantly includes discussion about gender roles, human rights, gender equality and threats such as discrimination and sexual violence. Our sexuality education syllabus should be inclusive and explicitly address these topics.</p><p>I now turn my attention to campus sexual violence. News headlines have recently been dominated by sexual offences committed within education institutions. From the Academic Year 2015/2016 to 2017/2018, 56 cases of sexual misconduct were reported to Autonomous Universities in Singapore and 37 of these cases were reported to the Police. Given the stigma around sexual violence, it is reasonable to assume that many more of such cases go unreported.</p><p>Students have a right to feel safe in schools. In 2016, it was asked if MOE would formulate guidelines and provide anti-harassment training to staff in tertiary institutions in Singapore, based on the recommendations of the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment. Then, they responded that institution-specific codes of conduct were already in place to prevent harassment on campuses across the nation.</p><p>However, in the wake of Monica Baey\\'s brave sharing last year, it has become apparent that relying on individual institutions to develop their own policies and protocols is often inadequate. There is an uneven level of protection across institutions, with differing definitions of what constitutes harassment, and varying complaint, investigation and disciplinary processes. This means that whether students get their case investigated, how it will be investigated and what the outcome may be, and what support they receive as victims would differ, depending on where they go to school. This should not be the case. Violence is violence, and should be dealt with in the same way, regardless of institution setting.</p><p>Therefore, I believe the way forward is for the development of a national code or guideline addressing campus sexual violence that all education institutions can adopt. This code should set out the duties of the schools to ensure zero tolerance of sexual harassment, provide adequate victim-care support and set out standards and principles for investigating and managing complaints.</p><p>Another worrying trend is the rise of sexual violence involving the use of technology, such as social media, spy-cameras and mobile recording devices. According to AWARE, the number of technology-facilitated sexual violence cases they have seen had increased threefold in the last three years. In 2018, they saw 124 cases, more than half of which involved sexual images of the survivors that were non-consensually shared, obtained or created.</p><p>The effects of technology-facilitated sexual violence on the survivor can be just as traumatic as other forms of sexual violence. Having one’s privacy being invaded and intimate images of themselves shared publicly without consent renders a distressing sense of helplessness. Even with the successful conviction of the perpetrator, the traumatic effects of having one’s intimate images and recordings still circulating in the public domain will still be felt by survivors. I hope that survivors of such offences can be better protected.</p><p>Perhaps mechanisms could be set up for the swift removal of non-consensually shared intimate materials, even before conviction. In Australia, complaints about one’s intimate recording being shared non-consensually can be made to the eSafety Commissioner online. The Commissioner is then empowered to issue removal notices for the end-user or service provider to remove the materials in question within 48 hours. We should consider having such a similar mechanism in place.</p><p>I hope that Deputy Prime Minister Heng and the team behind the Budget will take these suggestions into consideration.</p><h6>12.33 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>: \"Daddy, why don\\'t I take the school bus so that you do not need to rush anymore?\" Those words by my daughter Ella cut through my heart like a knife. My six-year-old daughter taught me an important lesson that morning when I was sending her to school last year, a very painful lesson.&nbsp;She made me realise that it was time to slow down and not rush all the time, especially in front of her, how my actions had made her feel bad and a reminder about how precious time is.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Spend time with those you love, one of these days you will either say I wish I had or I\\'m glad I did\". I used this quote in this House a few years ago and I am sharing it again not just because it is a beautiful quote to live by but also as a timely reminder to myself and to all of us.&nbsp;</p><p>I do enjoy sending Ella to school. I love singing all the Disney songs with her on the way to school, I love listening to her talk about her dreams, how she was at the ice palace and enchanted forest and met Elsa. I love listening to all the gossips and playground politics in her school and, my goodness, there is so much politics. But, most of all, I love just spending time with her, precious Daddy-Ella time. Time we can never get back.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, we gave out a lot in this year\\'s Budget, helping our workers, enterprises, parents and their children, seniors and our environment. Many are appreciative of Budget 2020 but if there is one thing we did not give out, it is time. Time, which is priceless and time which our Government can give out.&nbsp;</p><p>We need more precious time with our loved ones.&nbsp;We need more time with our children who desperately need us. I am glad we provide childcare leave, which \"will provide sufficient time for working parents to care for and spend quality time with their children\".</p><p>But it has been more than a decade since childcare leave provisions were increased and it is time to review this again. Are the current six days sufficient? We already know that the vast majority of childcare centres have six days of annual closure. This means that, for most parents, the entire six days of childcare leave could be used just for these annual closures. Let us not forget about the additional three half-day closures on the eve of any of the five stipulated public holidays. What happens when your child falls sick or for any other times when childcare leave is needed?</p><p>Sir, my first suggestion is that we have specific childcare sick leave. Applications for such leave must be supported by a medical certificate.&nbsp;This is much needed as parents should be there to look after their children when they are sick. Out of all the illnesses, including chicken pox, influenza, stomach flu and the list goes on, let me focus on the Hand Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) as an example of why we need more childcare leave.</p><p>In Singapore, 90% of children have had HFMD infection by 12 years of age. This is something almost all parents face and we should help them. We must help.&nbsp;It is extremely difficult for parents to find help to look after their children as the infection can last for up to two weeks. It is also hard to find someone to look after your child as the care-giver has a good chance of being infected. I was infected by my children when they had HFMD.</p><p>From the employers\\' standpoint, do they really want their employee who may also be infected to come to the office and possibly spread the disease or any other illness to other employees, resulting in everyone going on medical leave?&nbsp;Also, do we honestly think that the employee can concentrate at work and be productive? Would they not be worrying about their child who is sick? How is this beneficial to the company?&nbsp;Having childcare sick leave will help the children, the parents and, ultimately, the employers.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, my second suggestion is that we provide this childcare sick leave on a per-child basis.&nbsp;Our current childcare leave does not make sense. Surely, we can all agree here that if you need six days of childcare leave for one child, you cannot also only need six days of childcare leave for two, three or four children.&nbsp;It may make sense if you can make sure all your children fall sick at the same time, which is not quite possible.</p><p>Sir, having childcare sick leave and having it on a per-child basis is not something foreign to this Government.&nbsp;The Public Service, one of the largest employers in Singapore, already gives some officers childcare sick leave and it is on a per-child basis.&nbsp;For example, officers with two children, one of whom is below age seven is eligible for four days of childcare leave per year with MC. An officer with three or more children, has nine days of childcare leave per year with MC. This is on top of the six days of childcare leave per year.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government clearly feels that childcare leave is important for people who work for the Government, why then would it not be important for the people we serve? Let us level the playing field.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;There may be an argument that giving more childcare leave can inadvertently affect the employment prospects of parents with more children. But this is not the case for the Public Service and, surely, this cannot be a reason for us to not do what is right for our people. Surely, the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices can be used to address this concern.</p><p>If we want Singaporeans to have kids and have more kids, then we need to give them more time to look after and be with their children. It is not just about making pre-school more affordable. That is important. But many I spoke to feel that if they are going to have kids but just leave them at childcare centres most of the time, then what is the point of having kids?&nbsp;We are trying hard to increase our TFR and beyond looking at the dollars and cents, we also need to look into providing parents with more time to spend with their children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The reply to my suggestions might be that we rather focus on flexible work arrangements. But this is not a zero-sum game. We can work on providing more flexible working arrangements for our people but also legislate more childcare leave.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, Deputy Speaker Charles Chong gave me one of the best advices just before the last General Elections. I used to help out at his Meet-the-People Session (MPS) and he always made sure I go home as early as possible once MPS ended. He said to me, \"Louis, make sure you don’t go home one day and your daughter calls you uncle!\". That advice is not just for me but for everyone and a timely reminder that while we work hard, we should also spend quality time with our loved ones.&nbsp;And it is not just about spending time with our children but also with our parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I am glad that all civil servants are eligible for up to two days of parent-care leave per year and that a growing number of civil servants are using both days of leave.&nbsp;The Government has stated, \"With a rapidly ageing population and smaller family units, officers with elderly parents will need time to take care of them. The new parent-care leave reflects our position as a family-friendly employer.\"&nbsp;</p><p>It is encouraging that an increasing number of private companies are providing this. In 2018, 20% of private sector companies offered such leave benefits, up from 15% in 2012. But 20% is still really a small percentage.</p><p>Our parents are the reason we are here today. They worked hard to bring us up and looked after us when we were young. We should be there for them when they are aging and now need us to look after them.</p><p>Sir, I lost my Dad five years ago. On 11 May 2015, I was getting ready to go to work and I told my wife I was going to inform the ACRES team that I needed to take some time off to spend with my Dad who was in hospital.&nbsp;I was already visiting him every day but I decided I should spend more time with him. As I was about to leave my house, my sister called and told me that Daddy had lost consciousness. He passed away that day.&nbsp;I really wish I can turn back time. I made a mistake and I regret it till today. I wish I had spent more time with Daddy and I miss him dearly.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps, through sharing this with everyone, this wound might finally heal and, through sharing, I hope that others will not make the same mistake I made. Spend time with those you love and remember that life is a one-way ticket.</p><p>Sir, this Government recognises that we need to spend time to look after our parents. It has been eight years since we introduced parent-care leave in the Civil Service and it is now time for everyone else to have this. It is time to legislate it.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government\\'s statement: \"With a rapidly ageing population and smaller family units, officers with elderly parents will need time to take care of them\", holds true for all of us and not just civil servants.&nbsp;If the Government feels that it is important for civil servants to have parent-care leave, then why not others?&nbsp;We are a family-friendly employer and now we should be a family-friendly Government.&nbsp;</p><p>I understand that the tripartite partners have also encouraged more employers to adopt the Tripartite Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs, regardless of whether they already provide parent-care leave.&nbsp;But this is unpaid leave. Why do civil servants get paid parent-care leave and others have unpaid leave? Again, can we level this playing field?</p><p>I also understand that care-givers have given feedback that they prefer flexible work arrangements over parental leave as a more sustainable way to balance work and care-giving responsibilities.&nbsp;But the parent-care leave we provide to everyone can, again, be the same as those provided to civil servants where they have the flexibility to take this leave in full or half-day blocks. This will address the feedback we have received and, if we want to, we can take it a step further and offer parent-care leave in blocks of hours.&nbsp;It is, ultimately, a personal choice to take leave to spend time with those you love but this Government can help make things easier for employees and I hope we do so.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, the Prime Minister said a few months ago that, \"We will always stand with workers (and) ensure your well-being. We will always do our best to help you and your children progress with Singapore and have a better life\".&nbsp;Let us also stand with our workers when it comes to childcare leave and parent-care leave.</p><p>Time is the most precious commodity. I hope this Budget is not just about the economy but also about giving our people precious time to rest and to spend with their loved ones.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, I hope that we can (a) introduce a new childcare sick leave; (b) provide this childcare sick leave on a per-child basis; and (c) legislate the provision of parent-care leave.</p><p>Minister Vivian Balakrishnan once said, \"Life is a one-way ticket. A baby will only remain a baby for a very short time. They will grow up before we even realise it. The thing about life is we cannot rewind time. So, my advice to young parents here is, your children need you, they need you desperately and they need you only for a very very transient time in their lives. If we miss it, we can never get it back.\"</p><p>Sir, I thought I should end by saying that I am still sending my daughter to school and picking her up. A few months ago, she made a card in school for me and gave it to me when I picked her up.&nbsp;This time, she melted my heart with her words. She said, \"I love you, Daddy, because you always take me to school\".</p><p>I am now a part-time school bus driver as I now have to send our twins, Katie and Poppy, to school as well. They, too, melt my heart with their words. I picked Poppy up the other day and she gave me a big hug and said, \"Daddy, I really missed you\".&nbsp;I look forward to more previous Daddy-Ella, Daddy-Katie and Daddy-Poppy time. I look forward to more hugs, more laughs and much more sweet words from them that give me that warm fuzzy feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, let us give our people more precious time to spend with their loved ones. Thank you and I support this Budget.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Dennis Tan.</p><h6>12.44 pm</h6><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Regrettably, I had to turn down my daughter\\'s request to bring her to school today because I was rushing out to work. [<em>Laughter.</em>]</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Mr Speaker, Sir, during last year\\'s Budget debates, I spoke of building resiliency in Singapore in economic and security matters. This year, I would like to devote my time to speak on environmental resiliency.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The world today is at a crossroads facing down the existential threat of human-induced climate change. Over 11,000 scientists worldwide now warn that the world \"clearly and unequivocally faces a climate emergency\". Singapore\\'s vulnerability to climate change is also evident. Our island is now being heated up twice as fast compared to the world and maximum temperatures, we are told, could reach 35 to 37 degree Celsius by the year 2100.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Many countries seek to take concrete action. One in 10 people on the planet now live in a place that has declared a climate emergency and have effectively used it as a jumping point for real action. Inspired by young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, youths across the world are rising up and demanding immediate action to address the climate emergency we are facing. Singapore\\'s recent SG Climate Rally is a cry for action from our youths, one that the leaders of today ought to heed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">My colleagues and I in the Workers\\' Party have heard it loud and clear. We agree with them and have sought actively to raise concerns about climate change and the policies that can be taken by the Government. We are glad that some policies have been looked into and taken up.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Yet, it would be prudent to recognise that there is a long way to go in building environmental resiliency in view of the lessons the world has learnt and is continuing to learn about our relationship with our environment. With the certainty of climate change, we, as a nation should be daring and set a bold Green Agenda to guide Singapore\\'s trajectory of development. Please allow me to put forth some ideas to this House.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We need a holistic view on climate emergency. We need a holistic response to all issues of climate change. In other words, the success of efforts to combat climate change must not solely be measured by the effectiveness of any one policy narrowly. We must also invest in and track efforts to address the wide-ranging impacts of climate change and our policies on society at large, whether be it on urban drainage systems, food security, water security, waste management, urban liveability or public health, to cite but a few impact areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">An example of this is coastal adaptation and flood protection. Thirty percent of Singapore\\'s land area lies less than five metres above mean sea level. Even under an optimistic emissions scenario, there has been projected that sea level in Singapore could rise by about half a metre by 2100, posing a coastal flood risk. Therefore, the establishment of the new Coastal and Flood Protection Fund with an initial injection of $5 billion is a timely move.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">As the Government commits to investing more in coastal adaptation and flood protection though, where will this money be spent on? Will the money be invested in the best science so that better projections of sea level rise can be made for Singapore? Will investments be made in the best social science, so that the prioritisation of coastal land uses can be better assessed? Will soft-engineering, nature-based approaches such as the restoration of intertidal eco-systems, which have the potential to protect our coastlines be considered for use under this fund, or will only hard-engineering approaches such as polders and land reclamation be chosen? It would be useful if the Government could give a sense of its spending priorities in this regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Preparing to adapt to climate change alone would be unwise. There must also be a move to mitigate climate change while we still can. Even as we have committed to the 36% cut on emissions intensity by 2030 in our first pledge, how have our efforts been to date? Perhaps the Government can provide an update.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Workers\\' Party also welcomes both the announcement by Minister Masagos Zulkifli at the Madrid Climate Conference last December that Singapore will submit its long-term Low Emissions Development Strategy soon, and the announcement by the Deputy Prime Minister that Singapore\\'s commitment to the Paris Agreement will be updated this year. We look forward to the Government\\'s updates, and to understand how they represent progress beyond our current commitments and strategies.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Next, Greening out Transport Infrastructure. Climate change has also accelerated the need to calibrate Singapore\\'s infrastructural development to meet environmental challenges. Transport is a major sector which requires such calibration. The Workers\\' Party therefore welcome<strong><em> </em></strong>the Government phasing out all ICE vehicles by 2040. However, many practical EV issues are to be hammered out in the interim and I will like to ask what actions the Government will take on them.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The biggest elephant in the room is on rebuilding an infrastructure currently tailored for ICE engines. The power grid in particular will be taxed. While Singapore is in a power glut now, electricity demand will only go up as Singapore moves on in its Smart Nation ambitions. One looks to Sweden with a ban on ICE vehicles slated for 2030, where demand for electricity is currently outgrowing capacity in local grids, forcing EV charging networks to compete with other infrastructure projects for electricity.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This is not to mention that Singapore currently generates upward to 95% of its energy via natural gas. While it is the least-polluting fossil fuel and has higher efficiency compared to ICE vehicles, there will continue to be a carbon footprint generated. While our current power generation mix will improve by 2030 due to more solar capacity, how are we moving to lowering the carbon footprint of our power generation in 2030 – 2040?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Also, with regard to charging points, the Government expects to have 28,000 charging points by 2030, but even assuming a 30% conversion from the current vehicle population to EVs, it still means about one charging point to 10 EVs by 2030. Should we even be contented with this ratio? Besides intelligent charging solutions, should the Government also consider the alternative of battery swap stations which have the advantage of speed, ensuring load on our power grid can be managed well, as well as providing a ready infrastructure for battery recycling? This has been tested in China and should be a key consideration here.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">How soon can we electrify our public bus and private hire infrastructure to EVs will also be important as many Singaporeans rely on such services. Would the Ministry of Transport give a timeline on this happening separately from the 2040 overall target?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">ASEAN cooperation is also needed if we are to successfully electrify our transport system. A key consideration here is Malaysia, where people and trade currently travel via the Causeway and the Tuas Second Link on ICE vehicles currently. If we do phase out ICE vehicles here, are we also implementing a ban on foreign ICE vehicles from entering Singapore? If there is no infrastructure in place in Malaysia to support commercial EVs, would that also impact our businesses with a top partner in trade?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This is important to get right as, on one hand, foreign ICE vehicles and how we handle the issue, may have a significant impact on our EV plans, and on the other hand, we should not be seen to export our green problems away with unilateral bans. Indeed, we can work with Malaysia\\'s state and federal authorities to build a sustainable and inclusive eco-system for EVs. To go one step further, we can propose an ASEAN Autonomous Vehicle and Electric Vehicle project that holistically looks at all the challenges of EVs that my colleague, Mr Leon Perera had previously mooted in this House. This will help to focus minds towards a target and benefits interconnectivity across the region.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The effective solving of these issues I have highlighted in the adoption of EVs can turn us into the bellwether state in ASEAN for EV adoption, just as Norway is for both the Nordic region and the world.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Next, Green Housing Initiatives. Housing is another area where calibration is required. If urban planning is right, we can reduce the Urban Heat Island effect, increase energy-efficiency and promote better waste management in our towns.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We therefore welcome the HDB Green Towns Programme as it encourages sustainable living. However, will the benefits afforded by this concept be accessible only to new towns, or will our current HDB estates in places such as Hougang and Aljunied be retroactively upgraded to enjoy these benefits?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We should also not forget about private properties and improving green efforts there. Even as they make up around 21% of the total resident households in Singapore, they account for 41.4% of the total electricity consumed in 2018. Therefore, improved greening efforts there can help net bigger gains. Would the Government consider expanding the Estate Upgrading Programme to include greening items for private estates? This may include solar-friendly installations in common areas and greening up shelters or building community gardens that act as carbon sinks.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Also, could there be further incentives to push for solar installations across private households that allow excess power to be sold back to the power grid? Currently, payment is made by way of a credit adjustment based on the prevailing nodal prices. However, there does not seem to be incentives beyond that for private households. If private property owners can buy in to such plans, this can help us reach the 2 GWp capacity target sooner and give further sustainability and robustness to our power grid.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Let us next talk about Protecting our Green Areas and Redefining Development.&nbsp;In addition to gearing up our economy and infrastructure to prepare for the climate emergency, it is worthwhile to ask ourselves whether we are doing our best to reap the benefits of environmental sustainability for our society.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Government often lauds its green accomplishments under the City in a Garden paradigm&nbsp;– on increasing accessibility to parks, on the upkeep of community gardens, and on projects like Gardens by the Bay, for example. Each of these efforts bear their own positive outcomes for environmental education, community involvement, ecotourism, and liveability. But, amidst the continual urban greening of Singapore, are we prepared to risk undermining the benefits provided by the relatively more natural and more sensitive green eco-systems in our country?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">These eco-systems benefit us in a plethora of ways – from helping us store carbon and cool Singapore, thus aiding our response to climate change, to acting as havens for biodiversity with educational value. In addition to their potential as sites for low-impact, sustainable eco-tourism, they provide Singaporeans with recreational value and with relief from our stressful urban environment – a benefit that is much harder to quantify but is nonetheless important.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Already, an NParks study indicated that Singapore\\'s land became a net carbon emitter in 2014. Over the past few years, we have seen the prioritisation of development projects over the benefits afforded by sensitive eco-systems due to such projects as the Cross Island Line, the Tengah HDB project and the Mandai Project. The latter two of these have been styled as a \"forest town\" project and a \"nature destination\", respectively.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Thankfully, environmental groups, academics and public agencies have come together seeking to reduce the negative impacts these projects will have on the environment, in particular on our local biodiversity and forest cover, even after mitigation measures. However, the question remains whether the Government will commit to securing the inviolability of our nature reserves and greater protection of the little that is left of our more natural, green eco-systems in the future, while finding better ways to plan land use for housing, transport and tourism. I will speak more on this in MEWR\\'s Committee of Supply (COS) debate next week.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I will now move to Shifting Mindsets.&nbsp;Beyond good policy, Singaporeans also need to come together in buying in to this Green Agenda. Mindsets must shift in the way we consume, to only use what we need to use.&nbsp;Just to cite a common example: single-use plastic bags. Can we take or use what we really need? Can we pack more things into each plastic bag? Do we really need to double bag all our groceries at the checkouts? If we only need to use say, one or two plastic bags for refuse disposal a day, do we need to take 20 bags from the supermarket a week? We can also reduce the number of single use plastic bags we need to take for our refuse by concurrently using good quality re-usable shopping bags. We may end up using fewer single-use plastic bags and may still have enough bags for our refuse.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">To encourage Singaporeans, we should ramp up our public education to reach out to Singaporeans of all ages and educational level and in different languages. We should even encourage easy accessibility to the latest research on climate change by the average citizen. Translating this research into readable, digestible commentaries for Singaporeans gives further buy-in and builds awareness.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">As the lead Government agency on climate change, the National Climate Change Secretariat should consider working with public and private research agencies and researchers on this so that easy-to-access facts and evidence on climate change can be in the public domain to build further buy-in for green policies.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, Singapore\\'s environmental resiliency is being tested in ways unprecedented. We should spare no effort to lead the region and the world in this effort, not only as an honest broker but also as an innovator in the space. As such, a bold Green Agenda should be considered as Singapore moves to the next chapter of nation-building. We owe it to our future generations to do so.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Cedric Foo.</p><h6>1.00 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Pioneer)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore\\'s success is evident. Whether it is the PISA scores of our 15-year-olds, our economic competitiveness, our healthcare outcomes, our CPF system or our public housing, the world looks to us as a model of a highly-functioning and thriving country. To be sure, we are still a young nation and we too, look to other nations for examples of how to do better here.</p><p>Singapore\\'s per capita income was about S$1,600 when we became independent in 1965&nbsp;– just S$1,600. Today, our per capita income is about S$90,000 (in 2019). This is more than a 50-fold increase in a short span of 54 years. Put it another way, we have achieved a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about 8% on average, each and every year over the last 54 years.</p><p>How did we manage to do this? I believe the pre-conditions of success are, firstly, the peace and stability afforded us by an effective MFA, our SAF and our Home Team. Beyond that, an effective and honest government, which is sometimes quite rare, and working hand-in-hand with our employers and workers.</p><p>These pre-conditions are necessary but not sufficient. I can think of two key principles that have served us well and have brought us here.</p><p>The first is fiscal prudence. Achieving fiscal prudence starts with having a balanced budget during every term of Government. Unlike in many other countries, Singapore has been building up its reserves, instead of running deficits. How we achieve this is to ensure that recurrent revenue – those that are built into our system and are not one-off in nature&nbsp;– equals to or exceeds recurrent expenditures&nbsp;– those that we expect to incur year after year after year and not one-off in nature. So, recurrent revenue must equal or exceed recurrent expenses. That is a formula for a balanced Budget and that is very important for fiscal prudence.</p><p>As pointed out in this House, Singapore is facing rising health care costs for two reasons&nbsp;– advances in medical technology and, specific to Singapore, a very rapidly ageing population. And also because we did so well in healthcare, our life expectancy is getting longer and that also mean that medical costs will go up.</p><p>Singapore’s healthcare expenditure is budgeted at S$13.4 billion for this year\\'s Budget and that is an increase of 16% just from last year\\'s Budget. This figure is expected to further increase over the next decade for the reasons I cited. This means that we have to address such increase in healthcare costs soon if we do not want to kick the can down the road for a future government to deal with, and to do so, in a way, by using recurring revenue because rising healthcare costs is a recurring expenditure.</p><p>Therefore, the Finance Minister has recommended a GST rate increase of two percentage points to take place between 2022 and 2025.</p><p>Now, the need for more recurring revenue becomes even clearer if we also consider two other risks to our fiscal revenues.</p><p>First, our Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) and, secondly, the OECD\\'s proposed Base Erosion and Profit Shifting\\'s (BEPS) regime.</p><p>First, let me talk about the risk of a lower NIRC.&nbsp;Today, the Net Investment Returns Contribution from our reserves is the biggest component of our revenue. In fact, NIRC is expected&nbsp;to&nbsp;be S$17 billion in our 2020 Budget, but lower than the S$19 billion in FY2019. Going forward, it will be increasingly challenging to achieve similarly high NIRC due to the very low interest rate environment all around the world. In fact, last night\\'s 10-year treasury is about 1.35%. So, 1.35% for 10 year\\'s money. In some other countries like Germany, Switzerland, Japan and so forth, they are even experiencing negative interest rates.</p><p>GIC\\'s mission is to beat inflation by investing in non-Singapore dollar assets and one of the instruments that they would use would be bonds. And if interest rates remain low, the risk of achieving high NIRC over the next decade or so, may become more challenging.</p><p>Secondly there is a proposed OECD Base Erosion Profit Shifting (BEPS) regime. What it means is that the OECD seeks to change&nbsp;the current corporate tax system from one which is based on the \"residency of the company\". So, if you are a company incorporated in Singapore, you pay taxes here. If this company has a subsidiary in the UK, it pays taxes in the UK. The proposal here is to change that concept of \"residency of the company\" to one where the \"consumer is based\". So, even if you are a company based in Singapore but if you sell digital services or other products or services to another country, say, in the United States, which has a large consumer base, then the US will be the country collecting the taxes.</p><p>Singapore is a small hub economy with a lower consumer base compared to larger economies&nbsp;with&nbsp;higher consumption. Should the OECD\\'s BEPS proposal be adopted, we could end up with lower corporate tax revenues.</p><p>So, the two risks are our NIRC, facing challenges to generate high returns and, secondly, if the OECD\\'s BEPS is adopted, then our corporate tax revenue will be negatively affected.</p><p>It is understandable that raising GST is very unpopular. But as an honest Government, we need to level with our people and we need to continue to abide by the principle of fiscal prudence, having recurring revenue matching or exceeding recurring expenses. And this is the formula which has secured Singapore\\'s success so far and we should not throw that away. Of course, this Government can ignore it because I do not think we will run into deep problems any time soon. But this is like kicking the can down the road and letting future generations deal with the problems. I do not think this is the right way forward.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I hope that the Finance Minister, when raising GST, would&nbsp;design the Assurance Package in such a way that makes GST progressive.&nbsp;So, while we raise recurrent revenue, we also try to reduce the income inequality here in Singapore.</p><p>But some have argued forget about raising GST. After all, we have big reserves. So, why not dip into it to fund our expenditure. Again, our reserves is finite and if we have recurring expenses, we need to think about recurring revenue in the system and not dip into a finite savings pool.</p><p>But more important than that, we should not forget that Singapore is a country without natural resources. We have no oil, no&nbsp;natural gas, no minerals, no gold, no silver, the list goes on, we just have no natural resources, period! Our financial reserves is our only reserve. If we deplete it, Singapore has no&nbsp;fall-back. We have no back-stop facility to draw upon. We have no European Union equivalent to bail us out. And if we have to resort to the IMF as past examples have shown, we would have to go \"hat-in-hand\" and such rescue&nbsp;package will come with many, many onerous conditions that will bog us down for many, many years to come. This is not where we want to be.</p><p>It is indeed the fiduciary duty of the government, as stewards, to ensure the fiscal sustainability and not to squander away the reserves, which, strictly speaking, we did not earn in totality but our forefathers and past governments have earned it for us. We inherited it. Therefore, squandering it would be leaving future generations ill equipped and vulnerable to deal with future crisis and to continue to bring Singapore forward.</p><p>The second important principle other than fiscal prudence, is long-term planning. In fact, we should not look at Budget 2020 in isolation but we should look at all such government budgets across the years, you will see a theme emerging.</p><p>This Government has over many years built up our infrastructure. Today, our tree-lined roads, our air and sea ports and our skyline are the envy of many. We are continuing with such long-term planning and are putting aside S$5 billion now to address rising sea levels and climate change. This is a problem that would probably only happen maybe in 100 years, maybe in 50 years, but this Government now, today, is dealing with this, and this is what long-term planning is about.</p><p>The other sterling example is Marina Bay where we had to reclaim land, let it settle for 25 years, and then solving a water problem and also creating a beautiful skyline at the same time. And that would not have happened had we not adopted long-term planning.</p><p>But beyond physical infrastructure, we also invested in digitalisation, which is a very important aspect of transforming our economy. Again, looking into the future, looking forward.</p><p>Most importantly, for many years now, the second largest expenditure item in our Budget, after defence, has been education. Healthcare is catching up. This is testament to our commitment to develop Human Capital. In fact, many economists have said that investing in human capital is perhaps the best way forward. Because the more you invest in infrastructure, the more maintenance cost you will incur, and the risk of obsolescence is high. So, I am glad that we have put education right up there as the second biggest budget item in many, many budgets of the past.</p><p>Equipping the Singaporean worker with the ability to be more productive and employable will enable them to earn higher wages. This is the best way to becoming a&nbsp;more equal society. Education affords social mobility. It gives hope and it allows our citizens to have a higher quality of living.</p><p>In conclusion, I have talked about fiscal prudence and about why we should be careful&nbsp;– in fact, very, very careful – about dipping into our reserves. I have also talked about adopting a long-term planning horizon when it comes to government budgeting.</p><p>But beyond these issues, this year’s Budget has also set aside an additional $4 billion to address short-term immediate challenges like cushioning the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. And I applaud the Deputy Prime Minister and the Finance Minister for looking into this.</p><p>Although we do expect an overall Budget deficit of $10.9 billion for 2020, there is still a S$7.7 billion surplus for this term of Government commencing from 2015. Therefore, all the capital and operating expenditures as well as the government transfers including transfers into the Merdeka Generation (MG) package are all earned by the respective terms of government. And this is no mean feat. In fact, the total recurring cost of the Merdeka Generation package as well as the Pioneer Generation package are all paid for upfront and all earned by the respective terms of government.</p><p>Mr Speaker, this is a Budget I believe we can all support! Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Darryl David.</p><h6>1.13 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not an exaggeration to say that we are living in somewhat unstable, uncertain times.&nbsp;The magnitude of global events have increased and the impact of these events are far-reaching. For example, just as the world saw a potential improvement in the global economic landscape last year with the inking of Phase 1 trade agreement between the United States and China, along came the COVID-19 virus to make an unforgettable impact on the international stage.</p><p>The true impact of COVID-19 on countries and economies is hard to estimate, and it is likely that the long-tail impact of the outbreak could be significant.&nbsp;I am thus heartened to know that the Singapore Government has put forth an expansionary Budget to cushion the impact of COVID-19 and help Singapore-based companies and our citizens emerge stronger from this episode.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Government has come up with the Stability and Support Package to help key sectors of the economy – Tourism, Aviation, Retail, Food and Beverage, and Point-to-Point transport services – that are hit hardest by COVID-19. I am encouraged that the Budget will cater for tax and rental rebates to defray the cost of businesses, as well as wage-support schemes and training incentives to up-skill Singaporeans and keep Singaporeans employed during these difficult times.</p><p>Based on current medical knowledge, COVID-19 is more infectious than SARS and current epidemiology models seem to predict that the outbreak is likely to last longer than SARS. But even when the worst is over, it will take many more months before it is \"business as usual\". Would the Government cater more funds to support businesses and Singaporeans if the downturn period turns out to last longer than expected?&nbsp;Also, will the Government consider extending help to other industries besides the five already mentioned in the Budget, if the economic fallout spreads to other industries?&nbsp;</p><p>Moving on to the topic of supporting families, Mr Speaker, Sir, building on the momentum of the past few Budgets, the current Budget continues the trend of investing in our children and youth by enhancing the level of support for the pre-school and early childhood sector. In 2018, the Government committed $1 billion to the early childhood sector and I understand that it will invest almost twice this amount per year for the next few years to further support this sector.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of this investment will be used to enhance grants to ensure that quality pre-school remains accessible and affordable for young parents and that every young Singaporean child will be able to have a good head start in education to maximise their potential and human capital gains regardless of their family\\'s socio-economic situation.&nbsp;</p><p>While we have raised the income eligibility for additional subsidiaries for the Kindergarten Fee Assistance Scheme (KiFAS) to $12,000 a month to benefit a larger number of families, would the Government consider putting in place more support and subsidy for after-school student care once the child graduates from pre-school and enters Primary school? I believe this will help support families especially by providing working parents alternative care arrangements for children while they are at work</p><p>It was announced in the Budget that over the next 10 years, the Government will also set up a Community Capability Trust of up to $350 million to support our Social Service Agencies (SSAs) to strengthen their organisational capabilities and enhance their levels of service provision. This is part of the overall effort to transform the social services sector so that the SSAs can better meet the complex needs of our evolving society, especially when Singapore is experiencing a rapidly ageing population. I believe that this is a step in the right direction towards building a more caring society.</p><p>We also need to constantly encourage and incentivise our companies to employ people who are differently-abled. An example of one such company is Foreword Coffee that employs people with special needs as their baristas and cashiers or fast food restaurants that hire differently-abled individuals as wait staff and service staff.&nbsp;</p><p>As announced in the Budget, the Enabling Employment Credit (EEC) will replace existing schemes to support the employment of differently-abled individuals by providing wage offsets for employers. Can we further incentivise companies to employ differently-abled individuals by providing more direct incentives to these companies, perhaps in the form of tax rebates? I believe these direct incentives will provide a strong impetus for companies to offer fair and equal employment opportunities to everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the theme of a caring society is a significant and powerful one.&nbsp;Indeed, the COVID-19 situation, though challenging, has brought out and continues to bring out some of the best behaviour from Singaporeans from all walks of life as Singaporeans and local communities have come forward to support their fellow citizens.&nbsp;</p><p>Some have left masks and sanitisers at lift landings for their fellow residents. Others have come forward to organise food delivery and even social programmes for those who are under quarantine or those who have to stay at home. Many Singaporeans have also extended similar courtesies not only to their fellow countrymen, but also to the foreigners in our midst. NGOs have come forward to distribute masks and sanitisers to migrant workers, to educate them on proper hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among the migrant communities and some have even raised funds for those who need it.&nbsp;</p><p>These are examples of the indomitable spirit and resilience of our people. So, instead of sharing pictures of empty shelves at supermarkets or showing videos of residential storerooms that are stacked with hoarded goods, let us showcase more positive examples of how Singaporeans and Singaporean residents have rallied together to weather through this storm as one people.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, in many ways, this is a Budget for everyone and every segment of the society. More importantly, this is a Budget to help Singapore get through the economic uncertainties during COVID-19 and to ensure that we emerge stronger from this entire episode.&nbsp;</p><p>The current Budget demonstrates the decisiveness of the Government and its commitment to Singapore and Singaporeans as it has acted quickly and decisively to come up with a budget to deal with the many challenges that have arisen due to COVID-19. I am thus confident that this Budget is well-designed for such extraordinary times and end my speech in support of the Budget.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Rahayu Mahzam.</p><h6>1.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Jurong)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Budget reflects the Government\\'s priorities and directions for the country. It has to be visionary to prepare our economy and our people for the future, but yet also address immediate needs. To me, the Budget is also an opportunity to nudge behaviours and shape norms. The Government\\'s schemes and policies send an important signal on key issues and should encourage efforts that make Singapore better as a nation.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the support given to firms to train and redesign jobs for workers would hopefully translate to businesses and a workforce that is more productive and future-ready. Incentives for energy-efficient appliances or cleaner energy products should encourage better adoption of such products and in the long run create a greener Singapore. Support for employers to hire Singaporean persons with disabilities (PwDs) should encourage more to be inclusive and allow more space for PwDs to participate and contribute to the economy.</p><p>I am always keen to see the initiatives in the Budget that will help shape our values as a people. I am happy to note that the Government is building on the efforts from previous years to build a caring and inclusive society. This year, the Government introduced the Enabling Employment Credit (EEC) to provide stronger support for employers of PwDs. The intent is to provide help for PwDs to find employment and remain in the workforce. To me, this is important as it is a signal to be inclusive and normalise PwDs\\' participation in our society.</p><p>In recent years, I have had the great privilege of engaging with family members and care-givers of people with different abilities. There is a whole range of disabilities, including intellectual and physical disabilities, and PwDs come from a broad spectrum of age groups, from infants to the elderly. In my speech in 2018 on the Motion in support of inclusive education, I shared some of the challenges faced by parents of children with disabilities and called for more support for these families. Last year, as part of the PAP Women\\'s Wing paper on supporting parenthood and families, my colleagues and I engaged many parents to hear their views on the support needed. Dr Intan Azura, Miss Cheryl Chan and I had carried out an online survey to get a sensing of the needs of these families and we also held a dialogue to hear their stories. We had to summarise much of the information we received to fit the paper, but we shared our insights with the relevant Ministries after the paper was finalised.</p><p>Through this experience, we have found that: firstly, there is still a lack of awareness of the different types of support available for families with children with different needs. Secondly, there are specific circumstances in each family and thus the support extended needs to be more customised to be more meaningful. Some families, for example, may have more than one child with special needs and may need more support. Thirdly, the infrastructure and services available need to be more pervasive and accessible to families. Facilities, like playgrounds, should ideally be equipped for children with different abilities. We may have a few of such inclusive playgrounds but only in certain parts of Singapore. We also have a hub at Enabling Village in Bukit Merah where parents and care-givers could get assistance with some services. There is also a Care-givers\\' Pod in the village meant for the care-givers\\' use. However, those living in the east or north of Singapore may find it to be too far from them and are not able to benefit from the support and facilities available.</p><p>Much have been done in the sector, through the Enabling Masterplans, various policies and schemes as well as through the formation of workgroups to review the support to address different aspects of disabilities. However, there is still some way to go in closing the gaps to better support PwDs and their families. More significantly, one theme that repeatedly comes up from the feedback from parents and family members is the need to build a culture of care and compassion towards PwDs. Parents especially, worry about the world they would be leaving their differently-abled children in when they pass away. Could their children be meaningfully integrated within the community and be given opportunities like others? Will the society be kind, patient and understanding of their child\\'s needs? Will they be taken advantage of? Will someone stand up for their rights?&nbsp;</p><p>There is, therefore, a fervent hope that the Government continues to make effort to create awareness, build infrastructure and implement policies that would normalise inclusiveness and allow for people with different needs and abilities to be truly embraced as part of the community. This may sound like a lofty ideal to some, but not one which we should shy away from. We need to constantly and relentlessly participate in such efforts and seek partners from amongst the community.</p><p>In seeking for partners for causes that matter to humanity, I have found hope in the youths. I feel that the youth of today are very accepting of differences and have a strong sense of social fairness. Over the years, I have continued to be involved in the youth sector efforts especially through my engagements under M<sup>3</sup>, the collaboration between MESRA, MENDAKI and MUIS, and as a council member of National Youth Council. In my dialogues and discussions with young people, many of them have shown much desire for a more inclusive, more compassionate society. I am very heartened by their passion and I feel that it is so important to continue to engage them and seek their views as we build this nation.&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, I laud the Government\\'s efforts through MCCY and the National Youth Council, to meaningfully engage our young people. Now more than ever, young people are given opportunities and are empowered to make the change they want to see. There are many support mechanisms, for example, through, the National Youth Fund, the SG Youth Action Plan and NYC\\'s Young Changemakers Programme, which not only provide monetary grants but connect youths with mentors and like-minded peers to help implement ground-up projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from providing support to youths for their causes and to carry out their projects, it is also important to support them to achieve their aspirations. I note the provision in the Budget to ready our youths for various opportunities by providing more overseas exposure. This is very welcomed. I am hoping that many youths from different backgrounds can take up this opportunity. We should also continue to build on the efforts to support youth through empowerment and mentoring programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>I oversee the youth engagement efforts under M<sup>3</sup> and one of the key initiatives is to create a culture of mentoring within the community so that the Malay/Muslim youths have somewhere to turn to for guidance as they navigate through challenges and choices in life. There are also resources like the MENDAKI Future-Ready Toolkit and the M<sup>3</sup> Resource Directory which are available online for youths to refer to for information on various matters.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, at this juncture, allow me to continue my speech in Malay.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-27 Feb 2020 - Ms Rahayu Mahzam - Speech on Budget Statement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>It is very important for us to continue engaging and supporting our youths because they are the next generation who will inherit our nation. We must empower them and help them achieve their aspirations. I oversee the third workgroup under M<sup>3</sup> related to youth matters, and one of the focus areas in our current projects is the development of a culture of mentoring within our community, so that our young can receive guidance and knowledge from those who are more experienced.&nbsp;</p><p>This will hopefully help our youths grow their confidence and seize any available opportunity so that they can continue to progress. At the same time, we also encourage our youths to get involved and give back to society, regardless of race, religion or background. I hope that our community will continue supporting this effort and we can achieve our objective to develop youths who are highly competent, competitive, confident and show concern towards the people around them.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Indeed, the efforts to empower, mentor and engage youths should continue. We should involve young people in discussion of key issues and policies and find opportunities to work with them to create positive social norms within the community. There should, therefore, be an appropriate budget allocated for these efforts as well as provision of the necessary platforms for them to implement their ideas and work with people from different ages and backgrounds. I believe that if we work together, we can harness our diverse strengths and bring Singapore to greater heights.</p><p>It is akin to what we see here in Parliament. The Budget season is one of the more exciting periods for the House. The House is abuzz with anecdotes, findings and information about a myriad of issues. Members of this House pour our hearts and souls to the issues we champion because they matter to us, to the people we represent. I have seen the views that we raise in Parliament make their way to the formation of policies and I trust this will continue to be how the Singapore Government improves and builds on its framework for the future.</p><p>This Budget is aptly named Our Unity Budget as we stand together, united by our desire to make Singapore stronger and better for generations to come. Mr Speaker, I stand in support of the Budget.</p><h6>1.29 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Budget statement by Finance Minister.&nbsp;The past year has been a challenging year for many Singaporeans. Many businessmen whom I had spoken to lament about the slowdown in their business due to the on-going trade war between China and USA. They worry whether their business will be able to sustain in the long term.</p><p>When the COVID-19 virus outbreak hit Singapore, it was an even greater blow to these businesses. MTI reduced its projected growth rate to a lower range of -0.5% to 1.5% for 2020. The drop in tourist figures, the fact that more Singaporeans are staying at home have affected the confidence of many.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, the expansionary Budget announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister last week is a real confidence booster.&nbsp;</p><p>As stated by many in the media, the Budget was generous and provided for several measures to help affected Singaporeans and businesses cope with the economic slowdown. There were also many long-term measures to help affected Singaporeans prepare for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Individually, many Singaporeans are happy with the Care and Support Package of $1.6 billion because it puts money directly into their pockets. This will help alleviate the cost of living pressures for the residents. I support the principle that those who are lower income should receive more.</p><p>I am also glad that the cash component of the Care and Support scheme is pegged to their income and not tied to the property type of the Singaporean.&nbsp;Last year, I had called on the Government to do away with distribution of Budget benefits based on home type alone. I believe this will benefit many retirees or seniors who are living in private properties but without any income. So, my appeal to the Government is to consider extending other benefits like the U-save vouchers and GST vouchers to retirees or seniors without income but staying in private properties. Again here I wish to stress to Minister&nbsp;– these retirees would not have income. The fact that they stay in private property does not in any way mean that they are rich or are able to sustain themselves. What they are looking for is also whether the Government can do more to recognise them for their contribution to nation building when they were younger.</p><p>Sir, I also support the measures to help keep our workers employed. For many Singaporeans whom I meet, their main concern is whether they can get a good job which pays them commensurate with their skills and experience. Most workers prefer not to be on any form of welfare. Hence, the Jobs Support Scheme, the Wage Credit Scheme, the corporate tax rebate and the rental waivers for some of the tenants would help businesses to survive the economic slowdown and allow them to retain their staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am also pleased that the Finance Minister had remembered the hawkers in the food centres and markets. The majority of such stall licensees are small businesses and the rental waiver for them would go a long way to helping them sustain their small businesses during such trying times when the food centres are quieter and business has dropped drastically for them</p><p>However, in the long term, what is important is not just cash handouts to affected Singaporeans or tax rebates to help businesses tide over difficult times. These payments cannot be permanent and moneys will eventually run out some day. Thus, I support the Government\\'s emphasis on helping business to transform and grow; to help our workers to upgrade and learn new skills; to help our students venture overseas so as to be better equipped to face challenges in the future.</p><p>This is akin to the old Chinese saying that if \"you give a man one fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach him how to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.\" We must not ease our efforts in pushing our local enterprises to change and grow into efficient and competitive businesses that can make Singapore proud. I long for the day when Singapore can boast of our own large corporations like Alibaba, Samsung, Apple and Google.</p><p>Sir, I have three points for the Government\\'s consideration.</p><p>I support the provision of Enhanced Housing Grant (EHG) to first-time flat buyers. The purpose of the Enhanced Housing Grant is to allow Singaporeans to own their own home and this is important for nation building. However, the quantum of EHG given is currently based on the monthly income of the flat buyer. If the applicant’s income is higher, the EHG will be lower. This means there is less incentive to buy a resale flat because you will get a lower EHG if your income is higher. This may result in Singaporeans with higher income always applying for a BTO flat where the subsidy will not change based on their income level.</p><p>I urge the Government to review the tagging of the amount of EHG based on the income of the applicant. I also urge the Government to consider providing the EHG based on the per capital basis and not just based on gross income. Otherwise, a Singaporean who may have a higher income will get less EHG even though he may have more expenses and need to provide for more children or retired parents.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I appreciate the intent of the Government to help Singaporeans stay employable and to use the SkillsFuture Credit to learn new skills. However, may I ask the Finance Minister how many Singaporeans have not used the 2016 SkillsFuture Credit of $500. Are the unutilised figures within the expectation of the Government?</p><p>Will the Government consider targeted useful courses that would help nudge Singaporeans to apply to use these funds to improve themselves to upgrade their skills? Otherwise, the 2016&nbsp;and now the 2020 SkillsFuture Credit may remain untouched for a long period of time.</p><p>Finally, in this year’s Budget, the expenditure for Healthcare has jumped to $13.4 billion. It now accounts for the second largest expenditure of the Government\\'s Budget, just before Defence. And it used to be Education when the Minister for Finance was Minister for Education.&nbsp;I acknowledge that healthcare costs have gone up and the recent COVID-19 outbreak has caused Singaporeans to be more aware of the need to ensure that our healthcare system works.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Minister has assured us that the GST hike will not take place next year, the reality is that healthcare costs will continue to rise. The Government needs to decide how to apportion the taxes which is collected and what resources to allocate into Healthcare as compared to Defence, Education, Housing and Transport.&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody likes a tax hike, but Singaporeans must understand that increased spending on healthcare must come from somewhere. I urge the Government to reach out to more Singaporeans to help them learn about the GST offset packages which is intended to help the lower income cope with the GST eventual increase.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, I am of the view that this is a good Budget to take care of affected Singaporeans and to prepare the country for the future. It shows that the Government deeply cares for its citizens and the deferment of the GST increase is a clear signal that the Government is responsive to feedback from the citizens.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I affirm my support for the Budget and wish to thank the Finance Minister for an excellent Budget that seeks to bring Singaporeans together.</p><h6>1.37 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Chong Kee Hiong (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I am heartened that the 2020 Budget has been carefully calibrated to cater to the COVID-19 situation which has had an unexpected but swift and severe impact on our economy and society. This is a big, bold Budget which comes at the price of a $10.9 billion deficit, responding to the need for help by Singaporean households and businesses.&nbsp;This crisis has shown the importance and relevance of our Government\\'s tradition of prudence. With an accumulated surplus of $18.7 billion over this current term of office, there remains a war chest of $7.8 billion, which is very reassuring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We should be prepared for a protracted outbreak as the situation is still evolving with growing cases reported globally.&nbsp;The solution does not lie in just successful containment in Singapore. It is a global effort by all countries to find a solution, as indicated by the World Health Organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Should the COVID-19 outbreak become more prolonged and have an even greater impact on households and companies than what is currently experienced, we believe that the Government would draw upon the surplus funds to finance further measures to help.</p><p>I would first like to touch on support measures. The Government\\'s Care and Support Package will go some way to provide relief to individuals who have experienced income disruptions due to the impact of COVID-19 on businesses. The combination of cash, rebates and grocery vouchers will help households to manage their living expenses for a period of time.&nbsp;</p><p>For Singaporeans living in 1-room and 2-room HDB flats, the $100 Groceries Vouchers provided to assist them are limited for use at participating supermarkets.&nbsp;May I ask whether the Ministry would consider allowing them to be used at provision shops or even markets?&nbsp;This will also be a way of supporting small businesses in our housing estates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I welcome the widening of qualifying criteria for the $100 cash support to citizens who earned more than $100,000 in 2019 or who live in private properties. This recognises that the COVID-19 situation is a challenge that all Singaporeans are facing and may be affected in one way or another regardless of their income level.</p><p>It would be good if the Ministry would share how it arrived at the various financial assistance figures. This will help to illustrate the intended impact of the financial assistance and also, the timeliness of the payouts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng has said that the Government \"…will be prepared to do more when the situation warrants it\". Has the Ministry also set for itself some indicators internally to decide on when further assistance be rendered should the outbreak crisis deepen? In such a scenario, the cost of certain essential goods may increase as disruptions in supply chains may create shortages in supply. Singaporeans may then suffer the double whammy of lower or even loss of income, and a higher cost of living.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the Jobs Support Scheme, employers will receive the 8% cash grant on the wages of local employees for the months of October to December 2019.&nbsp;What about businesses that started operating this year which are also affected by COVID-19?&nbsp;Would the Government consider helping them as well?&nbsp;In addition, may I request for the grants to be given out earlier, especially for smaller businesses which operate on tight cashflows and are already severely impacted?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Minister to review if the current reliefs are sufficient to prevent the loss of jobs, particularly in the retail and food and beverage sectors. With the decline in sales, operators will immediately look at cost cutting. Operating hours will be shortened, the number of part-timers hired will be reduced, full-time staff will be placed on part-time shifts and asked to clear their leave or take no-pay leave.&nbsp;In the event of a prolonged crisis, what can be done to support businesses so that job losses are kept to a minimum?&nbsp;</p><p>Feedback from various businesses indicated that the rent rebates of one month for NEA hawker centres and markets, and half month for commercial tenants in Government-managed properties are insufficient as they expect that the situation will take at least till second half of the year before it returns to normal. It is good for the Government to elaborate on the working assumption of the time frame for these rebates.&nbsp;If the rebates are meant to cover serious business earnings loss for February to April, one or half month rental rebates put in this context does seem reasonable.&nbsp;However, businesses seek the assurance that more help would be available if the situation prolongs or deteriorates further.&nbsp;</p><p>I would also like to request for more support to be given to companies embarking or expanding their sales via e-channels. This crisis provides the impetus to push SMEs which have been reluctant to consider this sales avenue. With the current cost structure and labour situation, it is inevitable that e-commerce would become the norm and form an essential part of any business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I would like to touch on positioning for the longer term.&nbsp;This Budget, like previous Budgets, have schemes to support the transformation of our local enterprises.&nbsp;Many of these incentives have a pre-set time period, for example, three years, or are subject to renewals or extensions.&nbsp;Companies change and transform at different paces, depending on the maturity of the industry and support available, especially for smaller ones.&nbsp;To encourage companies to plan ahead and remain continuously invested in the future, would the Government consider setting longer term horizons for selected incentives?&nbsp;For example, when Pioneer Tax Incentives were first introduced, longer durations, up to 15 years, were given.&nbsp;</p><p>As we continue on the digital transformation of our economy, more support would be needed to help smaller companies adopt new technology, not only with respect to the technical aspects but also with the costs.&nbsp;Perhaps tax incentives for the telecommunications or selected sectors can be provided so that they can lower the fees for the eco-system to promote adoption and switch-overs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Closer cooperation between MOM and Institutes of Higher Learning will be necessary to ensure that the SkillsFuture courses are of high quality and relevant to industry to support our economy’s transformation.&nbsp;The course materials, modes of instruction, quality of instructors, just to name a few, should be constantly reviewed and audited to ensure that they are up to par. The courses could also be broken down into mobile modular sections for the workers to learn on the go and achieve accreditation over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, while we are now facing an intimidating combination of challenges which include a global health concern, economic transformations and geopolitical tensions, I remain optimistic that we will be able to emerge from this victorious and become even more competitive and nimble.&nbsp;The trust among our people, our businesses and the Government is strong and that is the main reason for my belief.&nbsp;I would like to conclude with my hearty support for the Budget.&nbsp;</p><h6>1.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Alex Yam (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>: Mr Speaker, this is is a responsive, responsible and remarkable Budget.&nbsp;Responsive because it addresses an immediate crisis. Responsible because it remains fiscally sound. Remarkable because it took all of a few weeks to prepare. This is a Budget for extraordinary times.&nbsp;That we are facing potential global financial instability is moot. What we face is not just an invisible enemy but also the real visible damage it causes to the economy.</p><p>Last Sunday, I stopped by Marina Square at about 1.20 pm between my events.&nbsp;I wanted to pick up some things from a maternity shop. I was somewhat apprehensive because&nbsp;I knew how crowded Marina Square can be at the weekends. Yet, I entered a carpark that was sparse.&nbsp;From the carpark to the shop,&nbsp;I consciously counted a total of only 38 shoppers. At one of the empty children\\'s playgrounds in the shopping centre,&nbsp;I saw the counter staff staring blankly into space because there was never one shadow of a child within the space.&nbsp;At Jewel, outlets famous for their long queues were momentarily famous for non-existent queues.&nbsp;Although the crowds and confidence has returned in the last week, the damage has been done.&nbsp;Heartland malls have fared better a little bit better but still report lower numbers than usual. People are taking precautions.&nbsp;Food and grocery delivery services perhaps have benefited most from this crisis, But tourism and service sectors hit directly will take time to recover. This is also no longer a regional problem. It is not a regional illness anymore. It has global reach.</p><p>A responsive expansionary Budget is a needed assurance The $5.6 billion Stabilisation and Support Package, even if adjusted for inflation, far outstrips the $230 million SARS package in 2003. This is not just for business but for Singaporean.</p><p>The $1.6 billion Care and Support Package not only provides a leg up but also goes towards, hopefully, stimulating the economy through spending There are not many governments that can do this and do this quickly, and be so detailed in its response to a crisis.</p><p>Yet questions remain: one, is it enough? Two, can we do more? And three, when will we do more?</p><p>The MTI has downgraded the 2020 economic growth forecast, projected between -0.5% and 1.5% on the impact of COVID-19, just slightly better than Hong Kong’s projected -1.5% to 0.5%. According to the S&amp;P Dow Jones, the S&amp;P 500 has wiped out $2.138 trillion since last Wednesday with $1.737 trillion or 63% loss in two days of trade since the start of the week. And this is just on fear of COVID-19 impacting the Amercian economy.&nbsp;We need therefore to buffer ourselves against a potential recession.</p><p>The two packages are significant, but how much will the needle move? How much does the Government expect the worst downside to be?&nbsp;Are we able and prepared to do more? Can we still as responsive as we are currently?&nbsp;People are worried for their livelihoods.&nbsp;They have taken to heart with what this Budget has provided.&nbsp;But it may take more than care, support and stabilisation to shore up, if this drags on.</p><p>During the Ministerial Statement on COVID-19, I asked if more can be done quicker. I am heartened by the Budget announcements but urge more haste and more heart for those who are affected. And&nbsp;I hope Deputy Prime Minister can provide further reassurance on this.</p><p>While we need to be responsive, we also need to be&nbsp;responsible. We expect to run an overall Budget deficit of $10.95 billion.&nbsp;This is about 2.1% of our GDP.&nbsp;Yet our fiscal prudence means we will not be drawing on past reserves. This is a hallmark of stability and a responsible Government. There are not many governments that can do this.&nbsp;We only need to look around us and observe how things can go&nbsp;wrong. Getting our politics right is key. Looking north in the last few days, we are lucky to be spared the intrigue and drama in our system. Perhaps we should be thankful to the late Tengku Abdul Rahman that we are no longer party to this.&nbsp;We wish our northern neighbour well but we also wish that such distractions may never plague us.</p><p>In fact, despite the major interruption posed by COVID-19, we have not allowed ourselves to be distracted.</p><p>While responding to the crisis decisively, this Government has also not shifted focus With an eye on the future,&nbsp;SkillsFuture prepares us as a people for future challenges, gives us both the resource and also encourages personal responsibility. However, we also need to be mindful of how we implement the schemes. I heard feedback from SkillsFuture WSQ course providers of the challenges they face in claims, especially when participants do not complete or fail their course.&nbsp;Many end up not being able to pay and providers cannot claim. Some providers have also been told that if a trainee does not complete, they should factor the trainees as part of attrition or bad debts to be written off. We are all in this together.&nbsp;Honest course providers commit resources to develop and maintain these courses, and hope to be reimbursed in a timely manner.&nbsp;I hope that while we care for our workers and help them upgrade that course providers, been mostly SMEs, are also aptly protected for playing their part and not to be left with a recourse or assistance.</p><p>Beyond the short to mid term, the Budget also looks far ahead to an existential threat brought about by global warming. The problem is not immediate, but committing an initial $5 billion to Coastal Protection does show our commitment.</p><p>Mr Speaker, being responsible also means telling the hard truth, even if sometimes unpalatable. Yesterday, it was said in this House that, \"If you have nothing good to say, then best to keep quiet.\" That is easy, Mr Speaker, is the easy thing to do. It is easy to only say nice things. It is easy not to have to make hard decisions. It is easy to be popular and likeable.&nbsp;But being a good and effective leader is not easy.&nbsp;The difficult task is to tell it like it is.&nbsp;The difficult task is sacrificing personal standing to say the needful. And the difficult task is calling out bad behaviour when required.</p><p>This Government knows that hard truths hurt but does not shy away from it.&nbsp;Without these hard truths and hard decisions, Singapore would not be where it is today. That to me is the mark of true leadership and wisdom.&nbsp;When someone takes his or her duty seriously to make hard decisions, that is true responsibility.</p><p>Credit is due to the Deputy Prime Minister and the MOF team as well as the other Ministries for being able to respond to this crisis so rapidly. This Budget would have been a long process but to turn it around in face of a crisis takes mettle. It is therefore remarkable because it is responsive. It is also remarkable because it remains responsible.&nbsp;A government that can respond to trouble and not fall to the temptation of being populist in the process,&nbsp;all this because we also have a remarkable people and a remarkable country.</p><p>Our common response to COVID-19 is mirrored in the Budget. When DORSCON Orange was declared, many banded together to do something for the community. We have heard many examples over the course of the many speeches in this House.&nbsp;My own volunteers in my constituency asked what we could do to encourage our frontline heroes.&nbsp;In three days, we managed to pull together a programme which we called \"Cookies for SG Heroes\".&nbsp;We started off wanting to bake cookies and progressed to preparing care packs for the staff of Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. Within hours of putting the word out, the Girl Guides responded donating their famous biscuit tins,&nbsp;Hock Hua Tonic responded offering their herbal tea at cost, the Singapore Kindness Movement responded providing encouragement decals,&nbsp;Gain City came on board offering the use of their show kitchens, residents, Singaporeans responded.&nbsp;By the morning we had so much that we needed bigger bags to pack the care bags. A total of&nbsp;136 residents came together and we baked close to 11,000 cookies that day. The feeling was moving.&nbsp;One of our baking coordinators Pey Yng was interviewed for a video. She had moved out of our constituency a few years earlier but responded immediately when we asked for help. When asked why she wanted to help and stepped forward, she said, almost tearing, \"Instead of discriminating, we should be encouraging them.\"</p><p>&nbsp;Mr Speaker, these frontline heroes include our medical staff, allied healthcare workers, cleaners, conservancy workers, security personnel, back office staff and many many others. These are our fellow Singaporeans, our brothers and sisters.&nbsp;We are battling a stealthy enemy that does not discriminate. Yet a small minority do.</p><p>Yesterday, a former colleague of mine shared his wife’s experience. She works in the frontline and she was helping with contact tracing and temperature taking. Yet, someone felt that even amidst the heightened alert that he was entitled to take it out on her and her colleagues.&nbsp;Throwing the pen at her and shouting at her colleagues. Because? Actually, there is no need for a because.&nbsp;</p><p>Another resident confided in me sending me a Facebook message. I asked for her permission to share this with everyone. She wrote: \"Sir, I do not know why people treat us like this. Why is my uniform, which I aspired to and was inspired by others to don, now deemed as a mark of shame? Why do people stand away from me even when I am on the way to work, and not the other way round. Why do people look at me with a glint of horror? Have I committed a crime? It hurts. But I will keep doing what I love. I will keep on saving lives because many Singaporeans are not like them. And when those who shun us arrive in my hospital, I will care for them just the same as the others. With love, with respect and to the best of my ability because just like the Nurse\\'s Pledge I took, I will uphold my integrity.”</p><p>Mr Speaker, when this crisis comes to pass, when we get back to normalcy,&nbsp;I ask that we commit ourselves to do something meaningful to recognise our frontline workers.&nbsp;Let us do right by them.&nbsp;Give them back the dignity they deserve and in the process earn on behalf of all Singaporeans the forgiveness we all need for shunning them.&nbsp;We salute you, our brothers and sisters.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I apologise for the lengthiness of my speech because there is a lot of good to say about this Budget. I therefore add my voice in support of this Budget.</p><h6>1.57 pm</h6><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I congratulate our Finance Minister for presenting this very caring and heart-warming Budget which will take us through the difficult circumstances caused by COVID-19. It is like a very much needed vaccine to support our economy, especially the badly affected sectors, and also to protect jobs for our people. Having said that I would like to raise a few pointers for the Minister to consider. In Chinese, please.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah Budget 27Feb2020-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Currently, many people are concerned about the impact on the economy brought about by COVID-19. Employers are worried that they are unable to carry on with their businesses. Employees are worried about their job security.</p><p>I would like to thank the Government for providing a half to one month’s of rental rebate to hawker centres and Government-managed commercial tenants. If the outbreak continues, is this enough? Will the Government introduce more measures?&nbsp;</p><p>For example, will the Government reduce the rental until the DORSCON level returns to green? JTC or HDB, for example, can take the lead to reduce rentals of their commercial tenants and office spaces.&nbsp;I believe this will be able to reduce the impact brought about by the outbreak.&nbsp;</p><p>Of&nbsp;the $4 billion assistance, how much will be used to help SMEs? How can we make sure that landlords will share the savings with the SMEs?&nbsp;</p><p>Besides tourism-related sectors, many other industries such as manufacturing, maritime and construction, are also affected severely due to various extra expenditures and the fact that China\\'s manufacturing industry has come to a standstill. They asked if the foreign workers\\' levy could be temporarily waived.</p><p>Why is everybody looking to the Government for help in times like these? The outbreak has no mercy, but there is warmth in the world. Have faith in our Government, which is a caring Government.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Lee Bee Wah Budget 27Feb2020-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em> </em>I have also received feedback from several Grab and Gojek drivers who said that they are not eligible for the support package for full-time drivers, because they do not meet the minimum number of trips made due to reduced demand within that period, Will the Minister be able to take a look at this group?&nbsp;</p><p>I would also like to urge taxi companies to consider reducing the taxi rental rates until the DORSCON level returns to green. Many taxi drivers have shared with me that their income have dipped by 50%. A reduction of the monthly taxi rental rate by 50% will help them get through this difficult period.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Speaker, I will now move on to climate change.&nbsp;Are we exploring our full potential for photovoltaic (PV) systems?&nbsp;A PV system employs solar modules, each comprising a number of solar cells, which generate electrical power.&nbsp;Are we ready to allow Town Councils to install PV panels on roofs and vertical areas such as lift shafts?</p><p>A case in point is MPC@Khatib, our covered multi-purpose court that can accommodate four basketball courts.&nbsp;During its design, we enquired if PV panels could be installed to harvest the solar energy. As usual, I always explore ways to make Nee Soon South cleaner and greener. Unfortunately, the answer from HDB then was no. Maybe at that time, they were not ready. So, I would like to urge them to review this.</p><p>Many residents welcome the SkillsFuture top up which is very useful. I urge the Government to monitor if course providers raise their prices as a response.&nbsp;</p><p>I note there is a reduction in S Pass sub-dependency ratio ceilings (DRCs) for the Construction, Shipyards and Process sectors.&nbsp;It is good that the Government has a long-term view to reduce Singapore’s reliance on foreign labour. But if we do not have a pipeline of Singaporean labour for construction and shipyards, then cutting the DRCs might be an additional burden on companies. This could leave the companies no choice but to relocate out of Singapore, especially the shipyards.</p><p>May I ask what are the plans to ensure that we continue to create good jobs for locals and have a steady pipeline of local PMETs for the Construction, Shipyards and Process sectors?</p><p>In facing the COVID-19 difficulties, it is important to have the entire industry, that is, developers, contractors, consultants, subcontractors, suppliers and all stakeholders tackle the challenges cohesively as a whole. In the same way as how the relief measures are rolled out for the hospitality and retail sectors, the same should be done for the Property and Construction sector. This sector also holds a lot of jobs and should not be neglected.</p><p>Many local contractors also told me that they feel discriminated in recent few contract awards. In the LTA Jurong Regional Line Projects, for example, four out of seven contracts were awarded to foreign contractors. Another example, LTA awarded contract N112 tender to a foreign contractor though our local contractor submitted the lowest tender. The lowest tenderer is an established home-grown contractor. Why pay $6 million more to a foreign contractor? I know there is such thing as PQM (Price Quality Method) scoring.&nbsp;But if there is a gap in the capabilities of our local contractors, then we should handhold them and nurture them. We need our home-grown contractors to grow, to build up their experience, their portfolio so that they can venture overseas.</p><p>If we do not even support our own contractors, who will support them? Can we consistently apply the policy of Buy Singapore First?</p><p>New Budget measures aimed at boosting the retirement incomes and employability of seniors are a step in the right direction, but I feel we need to understand residents need better and get the priority right. I had seen cases where residents do not have enough money to service their mortgage loan or no roof over their heads, but they have money in the retirement accounts. To many residents, having a roof is more immediate and more important need than providing for retirement. How can we help them?</p><p>And I feel financial incentives alone may not be enough to encourage businesses to hire and retain older workers. This requires more in-depth study.</p><p>I move on to issues that residents are facing. Noise pollution from vehicle engines is a common occurrence faced by Nee Soon South residents and I am sure in many other parts of Singapore too.</p><p>If I may refer to a Swedish report published in 2009, which found people who were regularly exposed to traffic noise in excess of 50 decibels were 40% more likely to suffer a heart attack than those who lived in quieter neighbourhoods. So, the implication is besides the noise nuisance, they also create health issues and a cost to society. There are technologies used in other countries. The UK use Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) tech to dish out fines to drivers over excessive noise. Calgary, a city in Canada, is using Sound Camera and fine motorists with excessively loud vehicles. Similarly, Abu Dhabi Police have invented a noise-measuring camera, which will help officers take action against abnormally loud cars. There are also intelligent speed bumps that flatten when you are driving within speed limit. Is Singapore exploring some of these new technologies? Any Budget allocated for these? And will there be more stringent action against car workshops which do illegal modification to the motorcycles and cars?</p><p>Town Councils are essential in improving the environment of HDB residents. But often, Town Councils are hampered by regulations. For example, Nee Soon Town Council has been flying drones for its estate inspection but due to the regulations, our drone inspection could only be carried out during weekends. Can these regulations be relaxed? Another example, some Town Councils have been asking the HDB since Jan 2018 to allow Town Councils to procure our goods and services online.&nbsp;Currently, Government is on GeBIZ but Town Councils are not allowed to make use of GeBIZ for procurement.</p><p>There are e-procurement platforms that we could adopt but HDB has not come back to us on our request. Can we get some timeline for this? Also, can I ask MND to consider providing additional grants to Town Councils for older flats or flats built for the silver generation for the maintenance of silver-friendly facilities such as the Alarm Alert System.&nbsp;Such systems and others are expensive to maintain.</p><p>I am happy to hear that HIP II is being implemented. And on this note, I would like to request for flats in Nee Soon South those which were built in 1987, be among the first few batches? My residents have been waiting for the programme for a long, long time.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, despite the issues I have raised, I want to put my speech within the right context. I fully appreciate Deputy Prime Minister\\'s thoughtfulness and insightfulness to swiftly get into the thick of things, given that this COVID-19 only came to attention in January. He was able to adroitly dribble his way and roll out so many measures across so many fronts.&nbsp;He was able to assess the impact on our economy and the ramifications globally, and work out the packages, without forgetting the packages for our seniors and for families. And while doing all these, the coronavirus was still evolving.</p><p>No one knows how severe it would pan out.&nbsp;Even as we gather here today to debate, the virus is rearing its ugly head in many places worldwide. I think it is very fitting that we assure Deputy Prime Minister that we stand behind him and he is not alone. Perhaps my thoughts would be best expressed by quoting the lyrics from the Liverpool FC song: \"When you are walking through a storm, hold your head up high.&nbsp;Don\\'t be afraid of the dark because at the end of the storm, there\\'s a golden sky.\"</p><p>Mr Speaker, I would not sing, I cannot and I do not want!</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah</strong>: And I do not want to empty this&nbsp;House. But I will say this to the Deputy Prime Minister:</p><p>\"Walk on, walk on</p><p>With hope in your heart</p><p>And you\\'ll never walk alone</p><p>You\\'ll never walk alone.\"</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I was about to say that the HIP II flats should come to Kembangan-Chai Chee first, before Nee Soon. But because you quoted that song, I will let you go first. Mr Terence Ho.</p><h6>2.13 pm</h6><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member)</strong>: Speaker, Sir, the arts have always played an important role in defining our nation\\'s cultural identity in Singapore. The arts bring diverse communities together. For the arts to remain sustainable and accessible for all in Singapore, Giving plays a vital role to allow arts to live strong, develop and grow.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Amid the evolving coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak, the arts community brings people together, spreads love and positivity. My colleague in Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO), the CEO of SSO, Chng&nbsp;Hak-Peng shared \"three reasons why the arts in general, and classical music concerts in particular are essential even during times of crisis for a modern and complex society like Singapore\", in The Straits Times on 25 February 2020.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The arts is an essential part of life. As shared by Hak-Peng, firstly, it is important to maintain an environment of normalcy as life goes on. Secondly, music feeds the soul. And it re-energises, and allows audiences to breathe. Lastly, the arts help you to cope with uncertainty. Allow me to quote him in his article, \"For me, this is like building our psychological resilience. The arts help you to surrender yourself to the unknown, and the beauty of a piece of art or music reinvigorates your belief that, as human beings, we have the ability to transcend today’s problems and attain greatness.\"</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The current measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 have led to a number of shows and performances being cancelled or postponed. This has spurred arts groups to consider creative alternatives, such as digital performances, to bring some comfort during this trying time. Ding Yi Music Company held a very first digital concert Together We Stand, with local artistes and our Minister for Community, Youth and Sports Grace Fu sang in the finale piece. It was a touching and inspiring piece to battle COVID-19.</p><p>Prime Minister Lee also shared a special music video of \"Home\", performed by the Singapore Chinese Orchestra in tribute to our healthcare and frontline workers, on both his Facebook and Instagram. In his post, he mentioned that he was glad the arts community is doing its part to rally Singaporeans during the outbreak, including National Arts Council. They produced a very interesting and inspiring video called \"#StayStrong and #DontKancheong\" video, which involved many local artists and they shared what they have been up to and what they have to say to Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>Other than tapping on online platforms and social media, some arts groups and individuals continue to perform and bring the audiences some encouragement and positivity. When a group of people see others appear calm and able to appreciate the arts, it reinforces a sense of peace and chill in the community. This is more positive and encouraging than seeing each other rush to buy daily necessities, like rice and toilet paper and develop a sense of panic.</p><p>Just over the weekend, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) organised two full house concerts at The Esplanade. Just last evening, two young gentlemen&nbsp;– Wong Qin Kai and Goh Shunta&nbsp;– held a recital, \"The Erhu Works\" which I had the honour of attendingl; I was there at the performance. This is the flyer. And it was almost full house, even during this trying period. I hope such examples will inspire more to come forward, to build a more caring, cohesive and confident society, together.</p><p>Giving to the arts and culture has been significant in the past few years. For instance, Deputy Prime Minister Heng shared that the Government will set aside $250 million to boost efforts to partner with the community in projects, during the recent Budget announcement. This includes a $20 million that will be used to top up the Our Singapore Fund, which supports projects in the social and community domains initiated by citizens. The Fund will also be extended for five more years from this year.&nbsp;</p><p>I am heartened by the news and I thank the Government for putting aside this sum of money to boost community partnership and efforts, to bring forth more opportunities for all and to empower the arts.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Our Singapore Fund was announced in Budget 2016, I understand that it has committed nearly $4.3 million to more than 240 ground-up projects in areas ranging from heritage to sports. This Fund continues to help create access and opportunities to arts of different forms and engage Singaporeans of all ages. The arts build a more cohesive society and&nbsp;I wonder how this Fund can be further be extended to help arts and culture companies and enterprises to bring more Singaporeans together, groom and grow attendance and participation for the arts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak has also an impact on the worldwide economy. Economists believe that the growth of the economy has slowed down and in the case of a downturn, it would have an impact on the arts giving and sponsorship.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that a more targeted and well-defined Cultural Matching Fund (CMF) policy can help small, medium arts groups in Singapore to enjoy the benefits. To battle the economy downturn, I propose to review and reconsider the CMF. This could be a long-term measure, instead of a short-term or mid-term measure. Perhaps, the Ministry can consider to match not only for funds raised, but also for earned income such as the ticket proceeds. This would help many of the smaller scale arts groups with less fund-raising power to be able to tap on the matching fund.&nbsp;I will share more, during the Committee of Supply.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Terence Ho Budget 27 Feb 2020 -Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;Arts have always played an important role in defining Singaporeans\\' cultural identity. With the increasing number of artists and people involved in arts groups in Singapore and a vibrant arts sector, every Singaporean is able to enjoy the arts.</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak has sparked worldwide concern and impacted public life. With the DORSCON outbreak alert level raised to orange, many Singaporeans inevitably felt anxious. Quite a number of arts performances were also cancelled or postponed.&nbsp;</p><p>In an attempt to uplift public spirit amidst the outbreak, local chamber music group Ding Yi Music Company held a digital concert on Valentine\\'s Day to spread positivity to frontline healthcare workers and members of the public who are feeling uneasy. In fact, online platforms have become a channel for many arts groups which seek to be heard. National Arts Council also launched a video with the theme \"Stay Strong, Don\\'t Kancheong\" on the 20th of February, with many local artists joining in the video to boost the morale of Singaporeans. The video has been well-received.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the Singapore Chinese Orchestra produced a heartwarming music video in a tribute to healthcare workers battling the COVID-19 virus at the frontlines. The music video, featuring one of Singapore’s national songs \"Home\", was brimming with emotions. Although everybody is feeling anxious amidst the outbreak, healthcare workers braving the storm deserve special support and care from the community. The music video by SCO received a \"like\" from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who said he was glad the arts community is doing its part to rally Singaporeans to fight the outbreak, and is able to continue performing for the public by going online.&nbsp;</p><p>The value of arts in the daily lives of Singaporeans have also been recognized. During this extraordinary period, arts groups have sought to encourage and unite the nation, as well as pay tribute to healthcare workers, through arts and music. In times of crisis, arts and culture can uplift spirits. For example, last weekend, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra performed two sold-out concerts; two young Erhu musicians Wang Qin Kai and Wu Fu Jun also performed to a full house audience last night. I personally attended this concert and I am heartened to see the huge turnout. The music does not stop, and life must go on!</p><p>In the budget statement announced recently, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat shared that the government will set aside $20 million to top up the Our Singapore Fund (OSF) and extend the fund to 2025. This is to encourage Singaporeans from a wider range of domains to initiate and launch more meaningful community projects. The Government will set aside $250 million to boost efforts involving community partnerships, with $20 million earmarked for OSF top ups to encourage more ground-up community initiatives.</p><p>The sustained development of arts groups is not only dependent on strong government support, but also the support of companies and foundations that identify with them, as well as the active participation, sponsorship and donation of our people. I hope that the Government will consider exercising greater flexibility and adopt a more targeted approach in the administration of the Culture Matching Fund. For example, besides providing matching funds for donations, the Government could perhaps consider providing matching funds based on proceeds from performances and ticket sales. I believe that this would help many small to medium-sized arts groups such as Siong Leng Musical Association, Nam Hwa Opera and Singapore Traditional Arts Centre, so that they can benefit from the Culture Matching Fund despite limited fundraising resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Arts knows no boundaries in terms of age and background, everyone can enjoy the arts. Arts helps to build confidence, enhance one’s image and attractiveness. Looking ahead, I hope that culture and the arts will continue to bring diverse communities together and contribute to a more cohesive society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): I am in support of Budget 2020.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Mohamad Irshad.</p><h6>2.25 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, allow me to begin with a moment of self-reflection.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Sorry. My apologies. Mr Vikram Nair.</p><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>: Sorry to interrupt the self-reflection.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I rise in support of this Budget.&nbsp;A government has many competing needs for expenditure and it is always a difficult exercise to allocate scarce resources to these competing needs.&nbsp;Singapore has, for many years faced structural challenges that each Budget has had to address, including an ageing population, ever increasing demands for social spending, particularly in healthcare and a risk of falling revenues as the workforce shrinks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This year, we had an added spanner thrown into the works as the COVID-19 virus threatening lives, but which has also had a withering impact on our economy.&nbsp;Against this backdrop, this Budget does an excellent job of both addressing our short-term needs in relation to cushioning the economic impact of COVID-19 while continuing to invest in our people and meeting our country\\'s long-term structural needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I will focus on the implications of COVID-19 for us in this speech, as I believe it is an important area in which the Government can send the right signals and messages, but ultimately, the entire population needs to come together with the right mindset to weather the storm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The situation in relation to COVID-19 is rapidly evolving.&nbsp;Singapore has dealt with pandemics before in recent memory. This includes the SARS outbreak in 2002 and the H1N1 outbreak in 2009.&nbsp;COVID-19 appears to be less deadly than SARS, but more infectious but less infectious than H1N1. And while it has killed many people in Wuhan and China, the overall death rate appears to go down as more cases are diagnosed and we have evidence of more people making recoveries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore had taken very firm measures to try and contain this, led by the 4G team of leaders, and its efforts have won praise from many quarters.&nbsp;We had to develop a strategy for dealing with the virus in very short order, including developing protocols for confining those at risk, treating those who were diagnosed and, at the same time, trying to keep the economy going.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Businesses were encouraged to test out Business Continuity Plans and many businesses are now experimenting with teams working remotely, and this includes banks, financial institutions, law firms, including mine and even the Courts.&nbsp;I have to admit, I was a little sceptical at first about the need for trying out such plans, but having tried the working from home, I have actually found it is quite workable and, in some respects, even more productive as you have less distractions and do not have to spend so much time travelling to and from the office. All in all, I think we can come out stronger.</p><p>However, this does not detract from the very real harm that COVID-19 has done to many sectors of the economy.&nbsp;Air travel and tourism, in particular, has been very badly hit.&nbsp;Changi Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world, has been relatively quiet, including the Jewel, where I understand you can now get an A&amp;W meal without much queuing. F&amp;B places are not getting their usual crowds, particularly those in town and employers and workers in these sectors are clearly worried.</p><p>In this respect, I think the Government\\'s measures to assist businesses are timely and send the right message.&nbsp;Rental is a big concern for many businesses and the provision of rental rebates as well as property tax rebates to property owners send a strong message that the Government is helping to buffer some of this pain.&nbsp;I am also heartened that many of the bigger landlords have also taken the cue and have confirmed they will be passing on these rebates on to their tenants.&nbsp;The Wage Support Scheme helps to cushion employers from wage costs, and I hope they take the message to try and keep their employees as long as possible.&nbsp;Ultimately, I hope we can come through this episode building stronger relationships with each other, whether it is with landlord, employee or customer and do not just see these relationships as transactional ones.&nbsp;</p><p>The Budget sends the right signal, but we need everyone to work together to make it work. Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will speak in Tamil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Tamil</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Mr Vikram Nair (Take 11) 2.30pm-2.45pm (27 Feb 20).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;COVID-19 has created slowdowns throughout the economy. Food and beverage, retail, transport and events related businesses are all suffering. Workers in these businesses also face uncertainty.</p><p>This Budget plays an important role in helping businesses and workers tide through this difficult period. It is important though for us to look out for one another during this time. For property owners getting tax rebates, please pass this down to your tenants. For businesses that get rental rebates and wage support, please keep your workers. If business is down, this will be a good time to go for training.</p><p>For older workers, please use the additional SkillsFuture grants wisely, and go for training that may help you pick up the skills that will be helpful at work or to transition to new work. The Government can create opportunities, but you need to come forward and use them.</p><p>It is my hope that we will come out of this adverse time stronger than before, like we have done during our previous challenges in 2008 during the global financial crisis and in 2002 with SARS.</p><p><em>(In English)</em>: In Singapore, we have had some good news over the last week.&nbsp;While in the early days, we were getting more and more news of people infected and some in critical condition, now we get more news of people being discharged.&nbsp;According to a CNA report yesterday, we now have 58 cases of people who have made full recovery.&nbsp;Of the 33 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving although seven remain in critical condition and in intensive care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, COVID-19 is now spreading rapidly outside our borders.&nbsp;Cases are now emerging all around the world, including in Europe, South America, Middle East and the USA.&nbsp;China’s economy has already been hit hard by the virus, with its growth forecast revised down to 4.5% in the last quarter, the lowest since the Global Financial Crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>If this becomes a global pandemic and different countries take different measures, the economic impact could have longer term implications for Singapore.&nbsp;As it is, the drop in business from China has hurt our economy and many others in the world as China is the world’s second largest economy.&nbsp;If other countries start closing borders or restricting business activities in response, there could be serious economic repercussions.&nbsp;If large numbers of businesses fail or close during this period, the implications on growth could be significant and Singapore will not be cushioned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In this respect, I think it will be important for our companies to be braced and prepared for the implications of significant disruptions in global trade and supply chains.&nbsp;In the short term, for companies that need to pay wages, bills and rentals on a monthly basis may appear existential, but in the long term, most analysts believe this will be a bump on the road.&nbsp;For workers who may lose their job during this period, please understand it is a difficult economy, but please make use of the wide range of measures available, including the SkillsFuture top-ups to retrain and try and pick up new skills. I believe if we ride the storm together, we can come out stronger. And this Budget is a big help in that process.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Mohamed Irshad.</p><h6>2.34 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, allow me to begin with a moment of self-reflection. Over the current term of Government, this House has accumulated a Budget surplus of over $17.4 billion. In the preceding years, many Singaporeans have expressed concerns over the size of this surplus. They have always wondered whether we could invest more in our people. Sir, Budget 2020, partly influenced by COVID-19, provides a timely answer to this perennial question.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, I will be focusing on three areas from this year\\'s Budget.&nbsp;First, our ability to quickly respond to crisis; second, creating a future-ready city; and third,&nbsp;continued investments in our fellow Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I begin by speaking about our nation\\'s ability to quickly respond to crisis. As Members are aware, COVID-19 spread like a wildfire.&nbsp;Without doubt, COVID-19 is one of the biggest crises Singapore has faced in over a decade. As the impact of COVID-19 continues to unfold, Budget 2020 addresses several of our immediate macro-economic concerns and with such a forward-looking budget, I am confident that together we will overcome this crisis and emerge stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Mr Speaker, in my conversations with our fellow Singaporeans, many have expressed the views that the crisis management aspect of the Budget will only last a few months.&nbsp;Sir, I understand their concerns. Those of us who experienced SARS keenly remember its impact. Given the uncertainty behind the long-term progression of COVID-19, I wish to ask the hon Minister what further measures can we expect in a Supplementary Budget.</p><p>In the event that the war against the virus becomes protracted, how will this House respond? I am sure that a positive response will allay the anxieties of many.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I wish to speak about the individuals fighting on the frontlines. As we continue to manage the outbreak, we are witnessing many companies tightening their belt. Reports of companies freezing staff salaries, implementing pay and bonus cuts are increasingly surfacing in the media.&nbsp;</p><p>To my understanding, our healthcare system is not immune to these financial pressures. Our hospitals have understandably been forced to shelve their revenue-generating cases to deal with this outbreak. It is understood that this decrease in revenue will have an impact on the bonuses that our healthcare workers will receive.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, given the extraordinary circumstances, I hope the Finance Minister will consider extending financial support or even bonuses to our nurses and doctors who are in the frontlines. In this regard, I echo the suggestions made by Member Murali Pillai yesterday. Ultimately, Sir, they not only had to work longer hours, but literally put their lives on the line.</p><p>Sir, I turn to focus on our economy as a whole. I am keenly aware of the Government’s announcement that GST will remain at 7% for 2021; and the $6 billion dollar Assurance Package for Singaporeans to cushion the projected increase in GST.&nbsp;</p><p>While I understand that we cannot put off the increase indefinitely, can the Minister give an indication of when the eventual hike will be implemented? Additionally, would the Minister consider increasing GST in stages; from 7% to 8% and eventually from 8% to 9%.</p><p>Lastly, turning away from GST, I also note that Deputy Prime Minister has announced a Corporate Income Tax Rebate of 25% for 2020. In view of the economic crunch that we are facing, I wonder if the Government would consider granting a similar tax rebate for Personal Income Tax to help Singaporean with their cashflow.</p><p>Sir let me close this segment on our response to COVID-19. The rationale behind our Budget surplus has always been twofold. First, to ensure that Singapore has room to maneuver in times of crisis; second, to ensure that future generations can have a share in the fruits of our growth.&nbsp;</p><p>We are facing a clear and present crisis with COVID-19. It is imperative that we do not lose sight of the big picture, avoid knee-jerk reactions, and respond swiftly for the well-being of fellow Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I turn to speak about creating a future-ready Singapore. As the COVID-19 crisis shows us, Mr Speaker, our nation\\'s success is not something which occurred in a vacuum. We are successful because we have continually planned ahead. Given our time constraints, I will focus on our national efforts in preparing for climate change. Today, I aim to spark a deeper conversation about whether Singapore has the infrastructure to survive.&nbsp;</p><p>I begin by speaking about our nation’s food resilience. In particular, I will speak on our investments in future technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, it is fair to say that the changing climate will have a serious impact on our food supply. The rising temperatures and concurrent decline in global fish stocks are an existential threat to Singapore. I remind this House that over 90% of the food consumed in Singapore is imported.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In this vein, Singapore must ensure that we are food resilient. As the recent panic buying episode reminds us, we have the capacity to withstand sudden shocks in our supply chain. However, what happens if we face a long-term disruption?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, I note that the Government has announced that MEWR will adopt a \"row Local\" strategy.&nbsp;The Budget commits to setting aside a portion of the $300 million under the Startup SG Equity in supporting agri-food related deep-tech start-ups.&nbsp;I support these measures. However, I have three questions.&nbsp;</p><p>First, what success did previous programmes aiming to encourage the production of local produce have? If those successes were limited, what changes are we making to ensure that our \"Grow Local\" strategy will be successful?</p><p>Second, do we have a local pool of agri-tech start-ups which will benefit from the increasing funding set aside for them?</p><p>And third, does the Government intend to support and encourage deeper integration of research and development processes between business and our tertiary education institutions in this regard? If so, what funds are being allocated to this in order to catalyse the process?&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, the point of these questions is simple. As we continue to invest in creating a food resilient Singapore, simply setting money aside is insufficient. We must create an innovative eco-system with positive feedback loops. It is my vision for future generations of Singaporeans to be able to consume local produce daily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Looking closer to our immediate future, Sir, I speak about our transition to electric vehicles. First, I state for the record my support for our efforts in encouraging cleaner modes of transport. After years of investment, the electric future is almost upon us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, I have some concerns about the overall impact of the scheme. I raise them in the form of questions for the Minister to address.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>First, 95% of our electricity is generated from natural gas. Insofar as we do not transition toward cleaner sources of electricity generation, what will be the impact of incentivising electric vehicles be? Are there any proportionate investments being made in transforming our energy mix?&nbsp;</p><p>Second, it is not disputed that public transport is more efficient and less polluting as compared to personal vehicles. A perennial problem preventing greater utilisation of public transport is \"first mile and last mile\" connectivity issues. In this regard, does the Government intend to accelerate our investment in our park connector networks to ensure greater access to public transport hubs and to encourage alternative modes of transport via cycling?</p><p>Lastly, as we even transition toward electric vehicles, how can we ensure that even less pollutive technology such as hydrogen fuel cells, are not locked out of the market?&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, I submit that simply transitioning to electric vehicles is not enough. If we want to have a significant impact, we must be prepared to think boldly. We must transform our mindsets. We must transform our infrastructure. We must take the lead in moving toward a fossil fuel free future in our region.</p><p>Thus, over the next few years, I hope that this House will seriously consider adopting alternative power sources including nuclear energy given the advances in technology and to look beyond electric vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I move to the final segment of my speech. Mr Speaker, one thing which unites all Members of this House, is our desire to serve fellow Singaporeans. In this final segment, I will focus on how we can continue to invest in our fellow citizens.&nbsp;</p><p>In this segment, I will first address our SkillsFuture programme. Following that, I will speak about how we can further invest in our fellow Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to succeed, our people must be adaptable to changes. They should be able to ride the structural waves that are disrupting the world. Our aims of becoming a global node of innovation and enterprise will materialise when we can ensure that our Singaporeans who are locally trained are globally framed.</p><p>On to SkillsFuture, Mr Speaker, I welcome the Government’s proposal to top-up the individual SkillsFuture funds. This sends a strong signal about our priorities. However, beyond topping up our SkillsFuture funds, I raise the following questions for the Minister to consider.&nbsp;</p><p>Although we have done well to promote the ethos of lifelong learning in Singapore and with Singaporeans\\'&nbsp;take-up rate of SkillsFuture&nbsp;being at 49% in 2019, how can we incentivise more of our workers to upgrade themselves?&nbsp;</p><p>Second, and related to the first point, I am concerned that the current SkillsFuture programme does not maximise the potential of all Singaporeans. I note that Budget 2020 does not provide any SkillsFuture top-ups for workers aged over 60. Given our increasing longevity, I wonder if the hon Minister can extend the additional top-up to those aged over 60.</p><p>In this regard, Sir, I have two potential solutions which this House can consider moving forward. The first involves tapping on&nbsp;existing expertise of our local SMEs. The second will require us to leverage upon existing technologies.</p><p>Firstly, I propose creating a framework for a Structured Apprenticeship Programme as implemented in the UK and Germany. In this programme, students will undergo apprenticeships which will eventually culminate in a full bachelor\\'s degree or industry recognised standards or qualifications. All these while earning a real wage and being trained in the skills employers want.</p><p>Sir, this idea is not without precedent. We currently have the ITE Traineeship programme. This is an apprenticeship programme that benefits both employers and employees where students can work towards their ITE qualification while gaining practical experience. In SUSS and SMU, part-time degree programmes are also available to individuals who wish to work and study.</p><p>Sir, a natural progression would be to tap on these existing frameworks and expand the work-study offerings in our system. I am confident that our SkillsFuture programmes will see higher participation rates if we are able to provide practical pathways to success.&nbsp;</p><p>More than a specific programme, Sir, I suggest that we leverage upon existing technologies to enhance our SkillsFuture experience. Currently, our SkillsFuture programmes exclude workers with little control over their schedule, such as shift workers. Singapore is poorer for the fact that a segment of our population cannot upskill themselves adequately.</p><p>Sir, I wonder if the adoption of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), or similar e-learning technologies, may be a potential solution to this issue. Over the last two years, our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) have seamlessly transitioned to e-learning following the COVID-19 situation.</p><p>Thus far, many lessons and tutorials have gone online. For instance, in our local Universities, even group work and presentations are being held virtually. This move clearly shows that the required infrastructure, platforms and systems are well in place.</p><p>Indeed, there are many models available for Public Service to consider. Such a synergy has the potential to lay the foundation for a public, open university that offers alternative structured higher education pathway for those seeking to upgrade themselves for their career progression.</p><p>At the end of the day, Sir, I hope that SkillsFuture will be made more accessible for our fellow Singaporeans. We should enable them to upskill, no matter the circumstance.</p><p>My last point on investing in our fellow Singaporeans, Mr Speaker, can be summarised with this phrase \"Locally Trained and Globally Framed\". Since our separation from Malaysia, we have always recognised that Singapore cannot be insular in our economic approach. We have invested heavily in ensuring that we are an attractive place to do business.</p><p>However, as the current crisis demonstrates, it is not enough that we create jobs in Singapore. Sir, I believe that our nation’s long-term economic survival depends on Singaporeans being able to compete overseas.</p><p>This is where the phrase \"Locally Trained and Globally Framed\" comes in. We need to ensure that our Students acquire the cross-cultural skills and deep international understanding which would enable them to compete with the best in the world. I am heartened that Budget 2020 sets a target for 70-70 exposure in our IHL students. In this regard, the New Colombo Plan initiative by the Australian Government is a model worth studying.</p><p>Sir, we must prepare our young people to succeed in the new economy. They must be relational. They must possess an international outlook and must hold their own in this ever-changing world.</p><p>In conclusion, Mr Speaker, a hallmark of Singapore’s Budgets is that in good times, we are prudent and sensible. In tough times, we demonstrate our mettle and sensitivity. Budget 2020 is a clear and unambiguous reflection of the latter.</p><p>In this time of crisis, Budget 2020 provides some much-needed stability. However, we must always look towards the future by making long-term investments in our infrastructure and our people to ensure Singapore is staged for success. On this note, Mr Speaker, I state my support for Budget 2020.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leon Perera.</p><h6>2.50 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 2019, we were considered by the World Economic Forum (WEF) to be the country closest to the frontier of competitiveness in the world. However, instead of giving in to the temptation to vaingloriously bask in such rankings, we looked critically at the report on real shortcomings so we can reflect on them. The WEF report highlighted room for improvement in respect of promoting entrepreneurship and improving the skills base, for example.</p><p>Sir, I should therefore focus my speech on three aspects of national life that pertain to the longer term outlook that we face – vibrancy, meaning the quality of the economy; livability and the well-being of the people and sustainability of our fiscal resources&nbsp;– before concluding with some directional suggestions that attempt to speak to the challenges we face across all these three dimensions.</p><p>Before I begin, I declare my interest as a CEO of a research consultancy that undertakes work in a variety of business arenas including industry 4.0 spaces.</p><p>Firstly, on vibrancy. Mr Speaker, Sir, on the back pages of The Economist magazine, they track economic indicators of various countries. Decades ago, Singapore\\'s GDP growth was consistently among the highest in the region and the world. In recent years, it has been more modest but still better than or the same as other developed countries in this region. In 2019, however, our GDP growth was low against even developed Asian economies like Korea, Taiwan and Australia, let alone the US, and this was before the coronavirus.&nbsp;The Government\\'s forecast for 2020 is roughly the same rate of growth.</p><p>Sir, while we face the short-term challenges of dealing with COVIC-19, in the mid-term, our economy faces deeper structural challenges.</p><p>Firstly, our economy is now heavily dependent on China which was experiencing a growth slowdown even before the coronavirus.</p><p>Second, our productivity performance goes up and down but it is also bifurcated between high productivity, manufacturing and other externally oriented sectors and some less productive sectors, and between an MNC sector with higher productivity and an SME sector that employs two-thirds of our workers with less.</p><p>Thirdly, our SMEs and particularly micro businesses will face headwinds, not only from the coronavirus, but also the more general China\\'s slowdown. In fact, it is argued in a recent letter in the media from the Chairman of Credit Counselling Singapore, many micro businesses may become ensnared in a cycle of chronic indebtedness as a result of the economic impact from the coronavirus episode, as happened with SARS in 2003.</p><p>Fourth, while the GDP share of R&amp;D is decent, it is not as high as in some developed countries, and there is some evidence that R&amp;D GDP share is linked to Total Factor Productivity.&nbsp;More importantly, beyond the MNC sector, it is not at all clear if R&amp;D is being taken up and commercialised successfully on a substantial scale by our local companies, notwithstanding some take-up of licences from A*STAR by local enterprises, for example.</p><p>Fifth, we continue to be successful in attracting foreign direct investment or FDI. But we have all come to acknowledge that future FDI inflows may be under threat from anti-globalisation trends that my party Chairman Ms Sylvia Lim spoke about yesterday. In particular, the deliberate efforts some countries may take to pull back supply chains to their domestic economies in light of things like the coronavirus and US-China geopolitical tensions.&nbsp;To insulate against this risk, we face the challenge of raising the game of our local firms.</p><p>Sixth, with the rise of uniquely disruptive technologies like AI, autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things and drones, whole categories of employment may be wiped out practically overnight. The advent of autonomous vehicles may put at risk the jobs of drivers in the taxi and private car hire industry. Many jobs in back-end operations and front-end services are also at risk from AI,&nbsp;robots and chatbots.</p><p>So, one additional challenge is to ensure that our people can keep their heads above tomorrow\\'s rising waters of employability amidst the sea of economic disruption not seen in generations, not only in respect of skill sets like Deep Tech and coding but also soft skills like creativity, leadership, entrepreneurial acumen and resilience. In fact, the authors of the WEF report cited room for improvement for Singapore in skills like critical thinking.</p><p>Sir, how do we meet the challenge of enhancing our vibrancy, which implies stimulating homegrown innovation and entrepreneurship?</p><p>The next broad point I will speak on is livability. A blind chase for vibrancy of an economy is no full guarantee of the well-being of its citizens. Putting effort into livability, therefore, is one of the most crucial challenges facing Singapore. What else can be done to breed confidence that our system will manage livability in the future?</p><p>Our total fertility rate has been one of the lowest in the world for years. Twenty-nine percent of young Singaporeans in a recent survey said that they would consider migrating in the next five years. I suspect that getting livability right would make a difference on these fronts.</p><p>The approach to managing the cost of living is a case in point. Why not develop an approach to policy-making that commits the state to adjust for future conditions by building the adjustment mechanism into policy design, rather than leaving it to future acts of Executive discretion, which may or may not happen? Right now, this is done in some cases like permanent GST Vouchers but not in others.</p><p>One example of this would be adjusting Silver Support for inflation from time to time based on policy design rather than leaving it up to the Government and Parliament at its discretion. Parliament can still vote against inflation-based increases should fiscal resources be insufficient. So, the mechanism can still contain an element of evaluation. But the fact that the design of the policy has a built-in&nbsp;mechanism to recommend changes and adjust based on inflation at certain defined time intervals create some assurance that, yes, society will not leave me stranded in the future one day. This is not just a benefit for today leaving me uncertain about tomorrow.</p><p>This is a very specific example to make the general point that if more well thought through social protections and stabilisers are built into policy design, it may assure Singaporeans that the society&nbsp;has their back. And this may reduce risk adversity and the focus on short-term income rather than long-term income. This in turn may promote a culture of being more willing to take risks to re-skill, to start a business and possibly even to have children because one is more confident about the future.</p><p>Some research suggests that our economic outlook and our sense of economic security does impact these behaviours.&nbsp;And if we fail to address the challenge of livability like parts of the US and England, our people may turn against globalisation which would damage prospects for vibrancy.</p><p>Let me note in passing, one could respond to this point by saying that this is a call for profligate spending because it requires spending commitments before we know we have the money to fund it. It is not. It is a call for building into policy design mechanisms that self-correct and have built-in adjustment processes rather than leaving it purely to future Executive discretion. The Executive and Parliament can still decide not to go ahead if the money is not there.</p><p>Next, Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to talk about sustainability. Vibrancy and livability already difficult challenges in themselves but we must ensure that policies aimed to address these challenges are sustainable and are responsible. To be sure, it is a good thing that we have large reserves that yield net investment returns or NIR, the largest state revenue stream today and that can be drawn down in emergencies. Many countries do not have this and have high levels of fiscal debt relative to GDP.</p><p>But are there not also dangers in going to the other extreme and being too prudent as it were? Could that also lead to a failure to seize opportunities to develop the capacities of our people for the future?</p><p>Clearly, we have to find the Goldilocks zone between these two extremes. An analogy from the business world might be the two extremes of spending too much and running into a cash crunch on the one hand and not investing enough in the company to develop the capabilities of the employees, new business strategies and intellectual property on the other.</p><p>Sir, our reserves have been estimated at over a trillion dollars. Every year, these reserves grow from half of the net investment returns as well as from land sales and any unspent surplus from each term of government, among other things.</p><p>I am not suggesting drawing down on the reserves at this point. But in the longer term, is there more scope to slow the rate of reserves growth, so as to release more funds to invest in our people and address the challenges we face in terms of livability, employability, innovation and so on that I spoke about in the first part of my speech?</p><p>Let us bear in mind that during the worst global economic crisis the world had ever seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s, during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, we drew down only a tiny fraction of the reserves. Should our reserves always go up and up at the same rate? Can we not have reasonable conversations about how to vary the slope of reserves growth while agreeing that the principal should only be drawn down in an emergency? And&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">how, in doing that, we can invest in our people and our companies so as to help them become the most creative, the most resilient, the most innovative, and the most entrepreneurial that they can possibly be so that they can deal with any challenges the world can throw at us with confidence?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">If we do use more fiscal resources to do that, we should also recognise that if our efforts are successful, we may be able to save and social safety net spending further downstream and we may also raise GDP and hence tax revenue which are good fiscal outcomes. My analogy here would be spending more to make vaccines free or close to free </span>–&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">a subject that I have raised few times in this House </span>–&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">which may have the effect of reducing state spending on hospital subsidies, MediFund and so on further downstream. And this is just an analogy.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, Sir, the three dimensions of national life I mentioned, are very much interconnected. However, as formidable as the challenges are, they are not insurmountable if we tackle them earnestly. Therefore, I would like to conclude with just a few directional suggestions on how we might address these future challenges from where we are at, at this point in time.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Firstly, investing more in local enterprises that can deliver. This was how the Japanese built up their world-beating giant firms&nbsp;</span>–<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\"> the Japanese and Koreans I should say. For those local firms which can consistently deliver financial and economic growth while safeguarding or growing domestic jobs to those firms that significantly enhance our economic vibrancy, more support could be provided beyond the caps and limits associated with current economic schemes. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">I had an exchange on the subject in this House with the then Minister for Ministry of Trade and Industry, Mr Iswaran in 2017. I understand his counter argument that we do not want to go too far down the path of picking winners. There is a grain of truth there.&nbsp;But some of our existing efforts like state-backed co-investment, for example, could be seen as picking winners anyway. And why not let the winners pick themselves?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">This was the philosophy of Korea in the 1960s and 1970s, where the state insured provision of loans to chaebols on large firms, which could consistently grow exports and hard currency earnings and loan support was withdrawn from those that could not consistently deliver those results.&nbsp;While to be sure not everything Korea did in those decades was correct in hindsight, that policy contributed to the emergence of giant companies like Samsung and LG today. Conversely, supports to local firms that do not demonstrate ambition and performance can be disciplined and focused on competitiveness improvement, job safeguarding and business succession planning.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Sir, this is a call for strategic results-based spending to develop local entrepreneurs in ways that benefit domestic employment. This is not a call to give away state monies to local firms irrespective of outcomes, and I trust that it will not be referred to as the latter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Secondly, Sir, we know that productivity is partly a function of investment and we cannot depend only on FDI for this investment in the long term. Can we not do more to tap on our fiscal resources to channel substantial R&amp;D investment into creating IP that is then seated to local companies in a very substantial and systematic way, but with the IP owned by the state and licensed to the firm\\'s so that the state can nudge these firms to grow in ways that benefit the domestic economy and locals?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">The area\\'s earmarked for R&amp;D investment in this way could be targeted so as to fill gaps in the global IP landscape in future-ready fields like AI so as to ensure maximum \"commercialisability\", so to speak. I know that there are limits to how much we can do under WTO rules and other treaty obligations, but surely there are ways to navigate these obstacles to some degree. And, as I referred to earlier, A*STAR has licensed IP to SMES, but the question I am raising here is how to upscale this to enhance the commercial impact and provide enablers to ambitious local firms to become world-beating.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Thirdly, many of our talented youth go into the Civil Service. Twenty-six percent of Autonomous University graduates go into the public service as their first job, according to a Parliamentary answer given in 2018. Can we create a programme that mentors and coaches civil servants in their 30s, 40s or 50s, who wish to leave the service to become entrepreneurs? Such a programme could help them develop skill sets relating to fund-raising, employee recruitment and retention, marketing and so on. Not so much training, but coaching and pointing them in the right direction as well as connecting them with funding sources including state back ones. After all, we do not only want locals to get the $7,000 jobs and the $10,000 jobs. We also want some locals to create such jobs.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Fourthly, can we undertake a project to map out the categories of jobs at risk from Industry 4.0 and then initiate a programme to inform workers in these sectors of the imminent risks over the mid and long term and nudge them to engage in re-skilling and career switches to high growth disruptive industries. Perhaps an incentive scheme could be deployed to attract local workers into Industry 4.0 sectors, like renewable energy, drones, AI and deep tech, especially those sectors where the Singaporean Core is weak. Having a pool of workers with such training could also help attract both foreign and domestic investment in these high growth sectors. Of course, any such move has to be done in tandem with the growth of investment in these sectors to ensure the jobs and career paths are available to those who join such industries.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Lastly, as part of the Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review (SPOR), can we adopt independent measures that regularly track the capacities of our people versus other countries in terms of attributes, like resilience, entrepreneurship and creativity? Beyond just hard skills and cognitive intelligence, it is these capacities that we need to nurture in the long term. It is these capacities that will be our surest defence against whatever economic and technology evolutions bring; and tracking them in the SPOR report is a nod to the fact that our policies do play some role, not the main role, or the only role to be sure, but some role, in nurturing these capabilities and capacities among our people.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the future is always uncertain but there are some epochs in history where it is more uncertain than average and we are probably living through one of these. We are dealing with huge geopolitical shifts, massive economic disruption, changing demographics, the existential threat of climate change and the possibility of Black Swan events like disease pandemics.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">But uncertainty is never a reason not to make projections and not to make both plans times of change and crisis are also moments for the agile the resilient and the creative to find new opportunities, anticipating and adapting to those moments in history like our own that see non-linear change can bring immense benefits not only in economic terms.&nbsp;</span></p><h6>3.09 pm</h6><p><strong>Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, by now it is no surprise to hear many saying that Budget 2020 is a timely relief for workers and some specific business sectors impacted by COVID-19. It also addresses short-term inadequacies while setting out plans for our strategic long term. I am thus encouraged by this Budget and glad the Government has prioritised assistance for different groups of citizens across our society.</p><p>Over the years, we have seen significant financial packages announced to address long-term healthcare needs for our ageing population, GST offsets for the lower income groups, housing support, education subsidies to level the playing field for improved social equality and much more. These packages seek to enhance social mobility, provide care for those more in need and promote greater wealth distribution across society. Without doubt, these packages which have a long tail, will have a hefty price tag as they cater for increasingly larger groups of Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, I wholeheartedly agree that the responsibility of the Government is to provide for those who have less resources and less able to sustain their daily needs. But the cost of living has been a perennial concern amongst Singaporeans, and even more so as we age. How can we better address this in current uncertain times?&nbsp;</p><p>Are the financial packages that we see now an indicator of the Government on what is to come in future? Are we moving towards more of a welfare state? And to what extent can the society safety net provide if self-sufficiency from family and personal means remain as the first line of support in our country? This is a topic that I think we should begin to consider – retirement adequacy.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2017, MoneySense commissioned a Financial Planning Attitudes Survey that showed only one in five surveyed felt they are knowledgeable about investing. Some Singaporeans also had misconceptions about when to start planning for their finances. Half of the young working adults aged between 17 and 29 have not started thinking about financial planning because they think it&nbsp;is still too early to do so. And just 20% of those surveyed felt the need to do financial planning only when they are looking at retirement. Whether the number of survey respondents were in the thousands or less, this is reflective of a worrying trend and the existing mindset of the young working class.&nbsp;</p><p>It is totally understandable that our current Pioneers and some Merdekas will need all the support that can be given as they earn lower wages in their lifetime and thus limited savings, much less a decent CPF savings to depend upon. But this cannot be the case for the younger generation.&nbsp;Today, most seniors rely on their CPF, housing, personal savings and some income from work if they are still gainfully employed or if their children are willing or able to provide for them. However, we need to recognise that this landscape is changing for the middle-aged individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>First, family sizes have shrunk with each family having at most one to two children. Parents are naturally more indulgent in their expenditures for every child. From enrichment classes, tuition, gifts, holidays and more; it is impossible to imagine any parent will give less to their offspring even if they do not compare with others in society. Through growing affluence, changing lifestyles and personal aspirations, it is par for the course today that each family have more expenses outlay&nbsp;over time. While general income level has risen and theoretically should be more for dual income families, it appears that meeting immediate financial needs are already a problem for some.</p><p>To&nbsp;plan for retirement which may be two to three decades down the road, may be a tall order for many of them. For some, the necessity to plan is just before they are about to enter retirement or have less certainty in being employed. The issue will be further exacerbated with fewer children in each family and for those whose children may be able to, but are less willing to provide financially for their parents.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, an increasing proportion of our younger generation are gaining overseas exposures at study or work and some are involved in the gig economy. For their benefit, we encourage more to internationalise, to learn and capture broader experiences and opportunities globally. But with rising percentage of such families living overseas, their retirement support pillars will inevitably change. For those living and working overseas early in their career, they may not have invested in housing within Singapore and the CPF contributions differ depending on their compensation package or the nature of their work. When they choose to return to Singapore in the later years, the cost of building their retirement nest will take a different starting point. By then, some may face different challenges in their ability to accumulate sufficiently for their retirement.&nbsp;</p><p>On one hand, I support and feel it is necessary for the country to continue to provide for its citizens. But on the other hand, I think it is time for us to consider if and how we can continue to afford&nbsp;these long term, larger support packages for every generation. As working and income pattern changes, increased exposure of living or working in more than just the home country before retirement, and investments in the next generation burgeoning for each family, I cannot help but ask if our citizens should plan their financial and retirement needs more holistically and earlier.</p><p>Sir, I would advocate that, as a nation, we should begin this awareness on financial retirement&nbsp;planning when each worker still has an active income and as they begin different stages of their life-cycle decisions. This has consequences on how and when we provide subsidies for those who cannot afford or those who are more vulnerable. How can we measure who qualifies or not for any scheme? That may need re-definition in future. Simply means testing by per capita income for each household may see the need for a different yardstick, or how intrusive would it be for the state to assess deeper&nbsp;on their situation beyond funds availability or even immediate family support. These are areas worth pondering and better sooner than later.</p><p>On this issue of retirement adequacy, I would also like to draw attention to the group of special needs individuals. There is a large spectrum of people with varying needs and the type of support required. As able-bodied persons, it is typical for us to have our own concerns about growing up, education, livelihood, family and occasional thoughts of what life might be like in our senior years. But for individuals with special needs, these may not even be fleeting thoughts for some of them. Some lack the ability to plan and defend for themselves, others could be limited for different reasons, thus, becoming an added worry for their parents who are ageing.</p><p>MSF has also continuously engaged different groups to understand and assist through provision of integrated support services aimed at promoting inclusion of persons with disabilities in the community and to enhance their quality of life. The third Enabling Masterplan for 2017 to 2021 spells out some of these enhancements.</p><p>In my conversations with my residents and having attended focus group discussions for people with special needs, their families, care-givers and employers, I realised that there is still much we can&nbsp;do as a society to assist them. How are we ensuring opportunities for all via our social strategies in education, healthcare and housing?</p><p>While some would argue that many recognise the need to include people with special needs and acknowledge their existence, I cannot agree that we have truly taken actions to be more inclusive in embracing people with special needs. There seems to be a lack of in-depth lifecycle planning support pillars for people with special needs from childhood to adulthood to their old age.</p><p>If we must begin the process, it starts from helping and partnering them, allowing them to be a part of our community from young. Indeed, this is a much needed step to provide their parents, family and themselves a little more comfort that they can live, work and socialise as a part of the community while comfortably being themselves.</p><p>There are a number of support that we can provide for them. I will cover more of this in the Committee of Supply debate on their living environment in public housing, their employment post-schooling age and how the community and businesses can partner them. Here, I will focus on two aspects.</p><p>One, rally the society to be inclusive from young.&nbsp;As a start, we must recognise the presence of people with special needs and their ability as an individual. Pre-schools and formal schools can do more to educate the children in embracing differences and welcoming them from within the school community. As individuals, all of us, too, can be more gracious, accepting and forgiving to families who have children of special needs. They deserve a place in our community, from the neighbourhood playgrounds to public transport and common dining places. There is no need for cold stares, harsh words or social media commentaries for any special needs individuals. They are individuals with their own rights and well-deserved to be treated with dignity like any other person. We should have campaigns that counter such negativity and give more room for families with special needs to be out in our community, to share our common spaces and feel at ease that they are one of us.</p><p>Second, provision of affordable legal support and streamline the search process of assistance schemes suitable for their needs. For special needs individuals, some may have disabilities or are cognitively challenged to handle legal matters on their own when their legal guardians are no longer around with them.&nbsp;Be it the Will, having an acting Attorney-in-fact or managing other legal matters that involve their daily lives, they are more likely to need better access and support at affordable cost on a regular basis. Having trusted parties who have a long-standing relationship with them and being able to defend their interests are crucial for those with special needs.</p><p>With the extensive assistance schemes available across the Ministries or specific to their special needs, it is not an easy task for them to navigate and know how to seek help. It is uncommon today for each special needs person to have been assigned to a social worker or being supported in network groups. When their legal guardians are no longer able to extend the help in organising their life needs, this will be an escalating concern and possibly more pressing for them apart from financial aids.</p><p>Mr Speaker, as a country and Government, we always begin with good intent to support and provide the best possible care for our citizens. This continues to be the guiding principle in our process of extending financial and broad-based support to the society. But as we progress in our nation building, it is also our responsibility to deliberate how much more we can do, whether a fiscally sustainable assessment is made for support packages and how do we address the future state of support that we hope it to be. My concerns, notwithstanding, Sir, I stand in support of the Budget.</p><h6>3.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, the COVID-19 outbreak is a test of our nation\\'s social fabric, our collective&nbsp;strength and character.&nbsp;</p><p>Around the world, we observed how the deficit of trust in government and public institutions prevented or worsened efforts to contain and control the outbreak. In one Asian economy, hundreds rallied for days to protest against plans to turn some buildings into quarantine centres. In one European economy, hundreds in a town protested having their fellow countrymen who were COVID-19 evacuees from China from being quarantined in their town, despite assurances by the government that none had symptoms of infections. They put up roadblocks, burned tyres and hurled stones at buses, resulting in several injuries. Out of desperation, the health minister declared she would spend the next two weeks locked up in quarantine with the returnees. In other places, government attempts to refute false rumours, although backed by medical experts, were ignored at best and stoked fear at worst. People hoarded critical supplies and deprived them from people in high-risk environments who needed them the most. In a public health crisis, it is&nbsp;heartbreaking to see such anti-social behaviours. Where has the “leave no one behind” belief gone to?</p><p>It is a different scene in Singapore, thankfully.&nbsp;In Singapore, we see some of the ugly behaviours, too, but there is a lot more of the good acts that we have observed. Where we saw frontline workers being discriminated or denied service by some individuals, we see an even stronger response from many Singaporeans who wrote messages and prepared gifts to express their support. We also see ground-up initiatives by groups of volunteers who engaged seniors and the more vulnerable within our communities to give out practical items, such as hand sanitisers. Of course, another example is when the silent majority seemingly came to life during the recent \"Twitter Parliament\", suggesting that hoarding and, therefore, depriving others of essentials should not be encouraged.</p><p>With decisive leadership and strong public institutions, we have so far kept the situation under control. Our leaders regularly inform the public of the latest development in Singapore, and the Government responds to queries with clarity and transparency. Civil servants worked tirelessly every day since before Chinese New Year to ensure \"no stone left unturned\". Medical frontliners bravely stepped up to care for patients, and cleaners worked extra hours to ensure a clean and safe environment for Singaporeans.</p><p>In fact, our efforts to combat the COVID-19 virus has been widely recognised. A Harvard study described Singapore as having \"gold standard\" for case detection; WHO was \"very impressed\" by Singapore’s response to COVID-19. Kudos to our Government and frontliners! Kudos to my fellow Singaporeans who demonstrated calm, reason and compassion in the face of uncertainties that allowed us to control the outbreak quickly. Thank you for showing us and the world how beautiful Singapore is.</p><p>These would not have been possible if not for the trust between our Government and people, as well as the strong social cohesion forged over time. We must cherish this and never be complacent.</p><p>Speaker, Sir, I see Budget 2020 as one that preserves jobs and social cohesion.&nbsp;In the midst of our battle against the coronavirus, we have this Budget debate. I am glad that in his Budget, the Deputy Prime Minister addressed the impact of COVID-19 on our economy as well as the long-term needs of Singaporeans.&nbsp;Budget 2020 is a responsive Budget that prepares Singaporeans for the challenges ahead. The $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package helps companies to stay liquid, thus preserving the jobs of Singaporeans. Against uncertainties arising from global headwinds, it is essential to ensure that Singaporean workers remain supported and adaptive, with measures to encourage them to be more productive and innovative.</p><p>In particular, SMEs – comprising 72% of our employment – are most in need of supportive measures to help them retain local employees. Jobs are important to Singaporeans\\' livelihood, important to keeping families financially buoyant and important to social cohesion. Various studies, including one by the World Bank in 2013, have shown that job access has&nbsp;a direct impact on a society\\'s trust and civic engagement. The same 2013 World Bank report also stated that jobs and the types of jobs influence people\\'s aspirations, social beliefs and their sense of belonging to the country. I, therefore, applaud the decisive move to set aside a whopping $4 billion to help Singapore companies and Singaporeans in this time of difficulty.</p><p>To ensure that the Government\\'s intent of providing our citizens with strong and reliable support is achieved, I have two suggestions, based on feedback from my residents and grassroots leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>First, ensure the good will that comes from these Budget measures ultimately flows through to the micro and small enterprises. For instance, passing on cost savings from commercial landlords to tenants and ensuring access to the Enterprise Financing Scheme by micro enterprises. Banks may be less motivated to serve individual micro enterprises, even with a greater risk-share by the Government, but these enterprises can band together if facilitated by the respective merchant associations.</p><p>Of course, it is not just the Government that can help the smaller enterprises. I note the recent launch of a “SME Help Fund” that aims to help SMEs whose businesses are struck by the COVID-19 outbreak. Member companies&nbsp;pooled together $5 million and leveraged&nbsp;technology platforms to offer low interest loans to affected SMEs, which must also be majority owned by Singaporeans. From application to disbursement, the process is as fast as 48 hours. I was told that the responses from SMEs have been overwhelmingly positive. When I spoke with one of the fund\\'s founders, JL Family Office CEO Andy Lim, he said they wanted to help SMEs and that this is one practical way of how Singaporeans help Singaporeans. I was very heartened to hear this.</p><p>This is an example of how different groups in the society can take the initiative to help fellow Singaporeans in times of need. Their efforts complement the Government\\'s and, collectively, these efforts help to strengthen our social cohesion.</p><p>Second, provide more recognition and support for freelancers. Freelancers are especially vulnerable to changes in the economic conditions. Many events and work assignments are cancelled or deferred as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. A number of them have taken their own initiative to band together online to support each other as they are hit by the outbreak. I trust that the unions are actively reaching out to them. Freelancers are especially vulnerable to changes in the economic conditions.</p><p>Many events and work assignments&nbsp;are&nbsp;cancelled&nbsp;or&nbsp;deferred&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;COVID-19 outbreak. They have little savings or \"fats\" to see them through this&nbsp;period of work drought. Worse, if they have a family to support.</p><p>Many of the financing options available now are not readily accessible to them as they are not registered companies and have no GST registrations. Could the Government consider extending the working capital loan to this group of freelance workers? Or help them access the other measures aimed at helping businesses with cashflow to keep them afloat as well?</p><p>As we address the immediate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, we should also not lose sight of investing for the future. I am glad that the Government continues to have a firm grip on this, evident in the other components in the Budget.</p><p>Still, I would like to reiterate the importance of investing in our people to ensure a high concentration of high-quality talents in Singapore, for Singapore. During this period of economic uncertainty, it is a precious opportunity for us to re-skill and upskill our workforce, catalyse the transformation and get ready for the future economy.</p><p>Singapore is clear about our future economy direction. We need talents to fulfil this. Technological disruptions have resulted in jobs becoming obsolete. But with technological advancements, many more new jobs will be created.</p><p>We need to provide good and meaningful jobs, where workers are empowered and have agency. But to take on these future jobs, Singaporeans need to be equipped with the right skills and possess international perspectives.</p><p>I support the ITMs and welcome the next bound of SkillsFuture initiatives. Singaporeans should be encouraged to work with employers&nbsp;to determine what courses to attend to ensure job relevance and be guided along as well. However, I wonder if these measures are enough.</p><p>Also, to attract top enterprises to Singapore to create good jobs, we need a high concentration of skilled workers with a critical mass of world-class talents. Singapore excels in the biotech sector now after 20 years of investments. A critical success factor is the large pool of high-quality talents that we built up over the years, enabling Singapore to lead in this sector ahead of competition. Similarly so for other sectors. Looking ahead, Singapore needs to offer an abundance of talents who not only meet existing demands but also attract future unicorns to Singapore from the region and beyond. As talents beget talents, there is a virtuous cycle to this.</p><p>Yet, global competition for skilled workers is stiff. In a February 2020 McKinsey\\'s article , it was reported that 87% of companies surveyed around the world say they either are experiencing manpower gaps now or expect to experience it within a few years. Respondents expect market and technology trends to play a big part in these shifts.&nbsp;More dramatically, the World Economic Forum describes the world as facing a \"re-skilling emergency\" One billion people globally need to be re-skilled by 2030.&nbsp;Companies and countries are motivated to close the skills&nbsp;gap fast. Singapore needs to be even faster – one to two years\\' window of opportunity, according to some prominent business leaders I encountered from within and outside of Singapore.</p><p>The Government has been investing and introducing targeted programmes to build up our talent pool. As the Chinese saying goes, \"百年树人\", talent cultivation takes time. But we are racing against time.&nbsp;Topping up with foreign talents may be part of the solution, but strengthening our Singaporean Core is, of course, the core solution. Therefore, to reinforce the momentum, may I suggest the following:</p><p>&nbsp;First, we need a stronger push for Singaporeans to re-skill and upskill, and right-skill from young. I am happy to know that coding is now compulsory for all upper Primary students, in the form of a 10-hour coding enrichment programme. This is a good step, but I hope the Government can consider taking an even bolder step and recognise it as part of formal curriculum. This signals the importance of this subject. Furthermore, some would argue that computer language is increasingly akin to English or mother tongue languages that we learn in school. As the digital future is inevitable, why not take that step further and recognise coding as our third language?</p><p>We also need stronger incentives to encourage adults to take on future economy-oriented courses. The additional SkillsFuture credits in this year’s Budget are a welcome addition, but to help Singaporeans pick up essential skills that allow them to compete globally over the long term, there should be stronger guidance and more targeted initiatives.</p><p>&nbsp;Second, we must continue to encourage international exposures for students and younger working adults. It is essential for young adults to be given full internship opportunities as well in countries like US, China, Israel and other emerging economies with a vibrant tech scene such as Indonesia and Vietnam, for them to gain a global perspective and foster meaningful networks that will benefit them and their professional community.</p><p>In this year\\'s Budget, the Asia Ready Exposure Programme, together with the Global Ready Talent Programme, are timely. Business China, too, is working closely with MOE and other agencies to promote internship opportunities for our tertiary students and young working adults to intern in China, and the response was encouraging. We need to work on availing more of such overseas opportunities for our young, so that we can cultivate a critical mass of young Singapore talents with a world view.</p><p>Third, we need to deepen our relationships with global top talents and facilitate value transfer to our own local talents. Could we consider a mentorship programme that attracts top talents and company founders from around the world to mentor our youths and start-ups? Singapore is a hub for many top technology and professional talents, and we should make use of this opportunity to groom our younger generation and&nbsp;benefit from their mentors\\' expertise, experience and networks. This initiative will also increase Singapore\\'s mindshare among these top talents and foster our youths\\' image as motivated, hardworking and bright young individuals who are globally competitive.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Tin Pei Ling Budget 27Feb2020 -Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mr Speaker, through this COVID-19 crisis, we can see the composure and decisiveness of Singapore leaders, the efficiency and meticulousness of organizations within the Government, the bravery and kindness of our frontline workers, as well as the generosity and mutual concern that Singaporeans have for each other. It has shown what Singapore is capable of, and how beautiful this country is.</p><p>In comparison, we have seen how citizens from other countries have lost faith in their government, discriminated against their fellow countrymen, prevented disease control measures from being implemented, resulting in the spread of the disease. It is indeed disheartening.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, the deep trust between our people and the Government is especially valuable. This was built over the years, with government policies that have always put the long-term interests of Singapore and Singaporeans at the core, allowing Singaporeans to enjoy a good quality of life and stable jobs. There should be no let up in efforts to build this trust.&nbsp;</p><p>In difficult times, the ability of governments to figure out the root cause of problems and implement targeted solutions to minimise impact on the people is very important. Hence, I am very happy that the Deputy Prime Minister has introduced a budget to deal with the situation during this critical period. Besides ensuring adequate supplies for frontline workers, funds have also been set aside to reduce the impact on companies\\' cash flow, so as to protect jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>Although it is important to deal with the current situation, it is equally important to plan for the future. Singapore has experienced many rounds of economic transformation and ventured into new emerging industries at different junctures, maintaining its lead successfully. The key to our success is the high concentration of good quality talent here who can meet the skills demand of new industries.&nbsp;</p><p>With Singapore moving towards the future economy, there will definitely be a strong demand for talents. In view of the shortage of talent around the world, some corporate big wigs believe that Singapore may only have a window of opportunity of one to two years to get ahead in artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. Attracting talent is a short-term solution, but more importantly, we need to ensure that Singaporeans upgrade their skills, and that we nurture our young to equip them with future skills and global mindsets. Although talent development schemes have been included in both last year’s and this year’s budget, I hope that the Government can consider the suggestions below.</p><p>One, incorporate coding into mainstream curriculum, ensure that all Singaporean children have basic understanding of coding so that they can have a head start.</p><p>Two, instil the spirit of lifelong learning in our people and encourage them to make use of the SkillsFuture Credit to take up courses relevant to the future economy.</p><p>Third, continue to encourage students and young working adults to intern in countries where technology development is more rapid. Aside from gaining experience, these internships will also broaden their horizon and their networks.</p><p>Fourth, set up mentorship programmes where top-notch talent and entrepreneurs can be matched with young local talents and start-ups with potential, to build capabilities, share experiences and network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In English</em>):&nbsp;As we enter more uncertain times, with pressure on our community from the COVID-19 epidemic and global financial turmoils, I am heartened to learn that this year’s Budget is comprehensive and inclusive. This is a Budget for our people and our future.&nbsp;I support the Motion.</p><h6>1.37 pm</h6><p><strong>Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Our Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister has delivered a remarkable Budget this year. In this regard, I wish to speak on 3Ms pertaining to the Budget. You might think, given the generosity of the Budget that my 3Ms stand for Massively More Money. But no, the 3Ms I will speak on today are mobility, maturity and mentality.&nbsp;</p><p>First, mobility. Social mobility is the holy grail of governance. In Singapore, we have made persistent efforts to boost social mobility with significant injections of social spending, especially within the past decade. Budget 2020 is no exception, especially with its Care and Nurture and Stabilise and Support Packages. I welcome the various measures including grocery and GST Vouchers, kindergarten, transport and school meal subsidies that will certainly help lower income families ease their financial burdens. We cannot underestimate the impact of such subsidies. I recall that when I volunteered at the charity Food from the Heart, children from poor families who received monthly food goodie bags saw improved grades. Why so? Once their parents stopped bickering over where the next meal would come from, and there was money left over for transport, the children started to attend school more regularly and this translated tangibly into improved academic performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond these financial measures, however, what more can we do to ensure that our society is not overly stricken by the proverbial Great Gatsby Curve? This curve describes how family resources and social networks influence a child\\'s future earning potential. When this curve is too pronounced, the advantages conferred by family wealth and connections get entrenched over time, leading to social stratification. As the World Bank\\'s Fair Progress report argued, low mobility, both real and perceived, can dampen an individual’s aspirations for the future.</p><p>To more directly address such discouraging perceptions, we need to initiate more systematic mentorship for children of less advantaged backgrounds so that they are inspired by role models who have successfully risen from similar circumstances. As the saying goes, \"you cannot be what you cannot see\". We therefore need to invest more strategically in more after-school programmes where students from lower income families are offered targeted academic support and career guidance in order to bridge the privilege gap.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My second M is maturity. As our economy matures and digitalises ever more intensively, we are at a critical crossroad to consider future growth directions. Clearly, in our well-connected society where we are bound together by the internet of people and also the internet of things, a promising path for us to explore is the one illuminated by big data. The application of data analytics in virtually all aspects of life, including finance, business, urban planning, healthcare and education, can generate powerful insights for enhancing resource optimisation, service delivery and efficiency gains. With data to fuel Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, we can forge a culture of data-driven innovation that aims to raise our quality of life.&nbsp;</p><p>But that begs the question as to who should own the data and be allowed to profit from it. The social compact between people and corporations which are collecting data about us is riddled with inequity. Indeed, the ‘compact’ is one of distinct asymmetry between the big technology companies and consumers. Hitherto, technology companies such as Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba have selfishly hoarded their data, from which they distill critical insights to create market dominating products and services. If we continue to let these Goliaths have exclusive rights to exploit the data that they harvest essentially for free from all their users, what chance is there for the scrappy start-ups of the world to innovate for the greater good? We must leave the door wide open for start-ups to compete against the incumbents. Oxford University professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, coauthor of Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data, suggests adopting a “progressive data-sharing mandate” that forces companies above a certain size to share some of their data with smaller competitors. In the same vein, the European Commission recently issued a document titled “European strategy for data” which outlined potential steps it may introduce to require companies to share and pool data.</p><p>Just as Singapore was a front runner as one of the first countries to launch a Model AI Governance framework, we should also consider blazing the trail and pioneer regulation on the collection and use of big data. This will have the twin benefits of levelling the playing field between first-movers and start-ups, and fostering a vibrant pro-innovation environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly too, academics should not be left out of the data game. At this point let me declare my interest as a professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design and a member of the Social Science Research Council.</p><p>Mr Speaker, our world is beset by a host of wicked problems such as sharpening income inequality, climate change, rising populism and the damaging scourge of online falsehoods. The best and brightest talents in our world-leading universities have much to offer by way of problem solving, as the multi-faceted COVID-19 crisis has highlighted. With more concerted regulation around data sharing, we can ensure that universities are well-equipped with robust data to conduct research for societal benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to further suggest that there be greater data sharing by the Government, for example from its national level surveys. Such data can help to facilitate productive and evidence-based policy analysis by academics and researchers in our Universities and research institutes. Concerns around data security can be addressed through the generation of synthetic data that realistically represents authentic data but that protects privacy and confidentiality. I am glad that plans are apparently underway for such data sharing and I welcome further details as soon as they are available.</p><p>Moving forward, we should also consider studying the experience of countries such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom that have advanced data sharing infrastructures and procedures, to identify best practices that we can seek to emulate. Data sharing by the Government is a strategic shift we must undertake to fully realise our Smart Nation ambitions.</p><p>Precisely because our economy is maturing and transforming, change is indeed the only constant and our workforce has to be prepared for that reality. I therefore applaud the SkillsFuture Credit top-ups in Budget 2020. However, this infusion of funds will be for nought if attitudes to upskilling do not shift.&nbsp;</p><p>My last M is therefore mentality.&nbsp;Our collective mentality around upskilling must change, from \"nice to have\", to \"must do\". And this mentality has to be shared by workers, employers and educators.</p><p>During a recent conference, I had the benefit of exchanging insights with practitioners and researchers in the adult learning eco-system. We all converged around several sobering points. That while our workers need to constantly upskill, they do not find the necessary motivation to do so. This arises from a combination of work-life pressures, inertia and resistance to change, and a sense of defeatism that the new skills they acquire will not translate into concrete improvements in their salaries or job prospects. Separately, when employers are dismissive of their employees’ needs or interest to upskill, their motivation is further undermined. Such negative mentalities around upskilling must be addressed, be it through nudges, support programmes or public education efforts.</p><p>Importantly too, we cannot expect Singaporeans to develop an inherent drive to learn unless they associate schools and other learning environments with positive experiences. As I mentioned in my Adjournment Motion in Parliament last month on the fear of failure, the overwhelming achievement orientation in our education system does not imbue an intrinsic love for learning. Instead, students become Machiavellian and grade-oriented, while instructors then teach to the test to meet KPIs. To become a nation of lifelong learners, we need to accelerate our transition away from a focus on grades towards broader and more enduring learning outcomes. Students should not just be learning, but learning how to learn.&nbsp;</p><p>With greater attention to these three Ms of mobility, maturity and mentality, I am confident that we can overcome the challenges ahead, both distant and immediate. I wish to therefore conclude by underlining my strong endorsement of the subsidies announced in response to the current COVID-19 crisis. The $4 billion package announced to help workers remain employed through three months of offset wages offer a vital lifeline in current climes. By helping an estimated 1.9 million local workers through this key Jobs Support Scheme, we can help to allay the anxieties of these workers and their families and demonstrate that ours is an inclusive society where we have a head, but also a heart.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Budget.</p><h6>3.47 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Budget. I will like to first declare my interest as the CEO of ComfortDelGro Taxi Business.&nbsp;</p><p>Given concerns over COVID-19, I am proud that Budget 2020 is the result of quick response, built on a deep understanding of what Singaporeans are feeling and going through. The Budget is one which will help us all to ride through this period of global panic in a calm manner.&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like to thank the frontline staff, especially the healthcare heros, MOH’s team and all involved in fighting the COVID-19 for their sacrifices, dedication and determination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am also heartened that in preparing Budget 2020, Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his team had spoken to more than 1,000 people, including corporate chiefs to collect feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As someone who is active in both the public and private sectors, the issue of balancing regulations to take care of the interest of the regulators and the companies being regulated, is one which continues to be of concern of many. Following my speech during Budget 2019 debate about cutting red tape, I was heartened that there were anecdotal improvements.</p><p>But apart from extraordinary situation, it is important for the policy-makers to consult the stakeholders regularly. Such consultation is a continuous process and a never-ending journey.</p><p>One area that catches my attention is SGX\\'s competitiveness.&nbsp;Following my Parliamentary Question in January 2020, last month, I am glad that SGX has relaxed the need for quarterly reporting and announced that half yearly reporting will suffice. This is a good move to reduce compliance costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, SGX seems to be losing its shine. I understand that many local companies are listing on other stock exchanges in New York, London and especially Hong Kong, over SGX. In 2019, 10 Singapore firms were listed in Hong Kong, raising US$155 million. This is a 25% increase from 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Computer gaming accessories company Razer chose to list not in Singapore but in Hong Kong in November 2017. Some of these firms listed overseas are apparently drawn to better liquidity and higher valuations. I have personally spoken to the head of two companies that listed their companies in Hong Kong last year. They have also affirmed the same.</p><p>Worse, according to Euromoney.com, delistings over the last five years have outnumbered listings. The number of companies registered on the SGX fell to 741 at the end of 2018, from a peak of 782 in 2010.</p><p>From the reply to my Parliamentary Question in January 2020, I understand that SGX is not tracking the number of local companies that choose to list in other countries. It may be wise for SGX to connect with some of these companies, to find out why they choose to list their companies overseas. This would also have implications on Singapore’s ambitions to become a prime financial hub.</p><p>Next, Mr Speaker, I would like to touch on the issue of sustainable transport. As a person intimately involved in the management of a large fleet of more than 10,000 taxis, a sustainable transport is an issue which I am most concerned with. On a yearly basis, ComfortDelGro Taxi replaces more than 1,000 vehicles on average and we are keen to replace them with cleaner vehicles that emit less carbon dioxide.&nbsp;Currently, we are trying to speed up the replacement of diesel taxis with petrol-electric hybrid taxis. Meanwhile, we also have four full electric taxis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, we are fully supportive of Singapore’s drive to move towards a sustainable and \"green\" transport and phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040. I am heartened by MOF’s announcement to launch an Electric Vehicle (EV) Early Adoption Incentive or EEAI by providing 45% rebate off the Additional Registration Fees (ARF), capped at $20,000 and subject to a minimum ARF of $5,000. At the same time, the Government will impose an additional road tax of up to $700 per year for EV.</p><p>When we do a calculation based on the more popular Korean full electric passenger car, the EV Early Adoption Incentive scheme does not appear to be attractive. In fact, the current Carbon Emission-Based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS) which offers a rebate of up to $30,000 off the ARF is more attractive than EV Early Adoption Incentive Scheme of only $20,000. The additional road tax makes a EEAI even less attractive.</p><p>In addition, cabbies that drive EV have to endure the inconvenience of taking 30 minutes to one hour to fully charge their electric taxis.&nbsp;The promise of halving the charging time and halving the cost of car battery every three years still remain a promise. In fact, some in the car battery \"industry point out that exaggerated claims are commonplace, and that not everyone is convinced”&nbsp;that planned car battery breakthroughs will become a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, I will like to clarify with MOF do they really think that the EV Early Adoption Incentive will entice fleet owners like us to choose EV over hybrid vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Do not get me wrong, I am supportive of having more \"green\" and \"clean\" vehicles. It is just that we do not want Singapore to bet on the wrong \"green\" car like the experience we have had of CNG cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than putting all eggs in the one basket, I would like to suggest considering other alternatives to not replace, but supplement EVs, like fuel cell or hydrogen vehicles. China, Japan and South Korea are already working to put millions of hydrogen-powered vehicles on their roads, because it is not only cleaner, its driving range and refuelling time are comparable to gasoline cars.&nbsp;</p><p>We understand that in the second half of 2019, last year, the Prime Minister\\'s Office has awarded a hydrogen feasibility study to American engineering giant Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, to assess the feasibility of importing hydrogen for downstream uses, ranging from vehicle fuelling to power generation.&nbsp;Can PMO or LTA share their preliminary thoughts while waiting for the full report of the study?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This year\\'s Budget, Mr Speaker, is the Unity Budget with an eye on COVID-19. Mr Speaker, Sir, please allow me to speak in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Ang Wei Neng Budget 27Feb2020-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]&nbsp;The COVID-19 outbreak has seriously impacted many Singaporeans, including taxi drivers. When people talk about the smaller crowd in downtown areas, I lament the fall in businesses for taxi drivers.&nbsp;</p><p>During the SARS outbreak, even though there was a drop in foreign tourists, locals still go to work as usual. But today, many office workers take turns to work from home and this has worsened the situation for taxi drivers.&nbsp;</p><p>We thank the Government for launching a special relief package for taxi drivers on Valentine’s Day. Taxi drivers will receive a rental rebate of $10 per day from the government, and another $10 per day in rental rebates from taxi companies. In total, taxi drivers will receive rental rebates of $20 per day. Yet, taxi drivers still complained. Taxi companies then decided to provide another $16.50 in daily rental rebates to taxi drivers. In other words, taxi drivers will enjoy up to $36.50 in rental rebates per day. Even though taxi companies will be running at a loss by doing so, for the sake of taxi drivers and the taxi industry, taxi companies still decided to go ahead with the rental rebates. But still, many taxi drivers are unable to make a living. We therefore hope that Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat will consider providing more assistance for taxi drivers. Thank you!</p><p><em>(In English)</em>: Their loved ones are most impacted by the outbreak for taxi drivers. All the taxi companies are providing additional help over and above the Government\\'s Special Relief Fund or SRF of $10 per day. Some taxi companies, including ComfortDelGro Taxi, is providing additional rental rebate of up to $26.50 over and above the SRF.&nbsp;That is, cabbies are getting a total rental rebate of up to $36.50 per day until the end of March 2020.&nbsp;With these additional rebates, the taxi companies will go into red over the next few months. Even then, the cabbies are still suffering a significant drop in their net income. Thus, I call on Government to do more for cabbies.&nbsp;Perhaps, the Government can consider matching what the taxi companies are doing for the cabbies by increasing the quantum of Special Relief Fund (SRF).</p><p>Singaporeans will remember the good deed by the Government.&nbsp;Just a couple of days ago, one cabby by the name of Robert Chew wrote me a touching email.&nbsp;Let me read out an excerpt of what he wrote: \"I would like to thank you as Member of Parliament for bringing our feedback to our Government and working with them to offer us some financial assistance by way of supplementing our daily rentals.</p><p>These are indeed very hard times for us as our incomes have been severely hit and many drivers have given up. Not to mention also the daily stress of fearing for our own health as we are frontline service providers who do not want to be a problem to our loved ones.</p><p>Sir, I would like you to know that we appreciate any help your company and the Government are providing us to help us survive this episode. This fight is far from over and may last several more months.</p><p>Let us work together in our fight against this epidemic as we look forward to coming out of this crisis stronger and better. We most certainly will overcome. We must!</p><p>May you and your loved ones stay safe and healthy.\"</p><p>Robert summarises nicely the sentiment of many taxi drivers.&nbsp;Other than P2P drivers, the livelihood of Singaporeans working in the private sectors have been badly affected by the negative impact of the economy.</p><p>Those working in the tourism industry are the worse hit.&nbsp;Gig workers and freelance workers are also badly hit.&nbsp;Many freelance workers are engaged by Government departments.&nbsp;For example, fitness instructors engaged by Active SG, orchestra music instructors engaged by MOE schools are having their earnings significantly reduced when organisations are cancelling activities involving more than 50 people.</p><p>While there is a cancellation clause which is included in the contracts of some legally savvy freelancers, many others do not. For such cases, I will like to appeal to MOF to allow the Government agencies to pay up to 50% of the fees charged by freelancers even when their engagements are cancelled due to COVID-19.&nbsp;Such help will go a long way in keeping them afloat.</p><p>Another vulnerable group are those in society who receive help from charities and non-profit groups. As fund raising has almost come to a standstill, this is because many businesses are more concerned with survival than corporate philanthropy. Thus, we must do what we can to help keep these charities and non-profit groups going and stretch their fund-raising dollars.</p><p>I will like to suggest the Government extend the Bicentennial Community Fund (BCF), where the Government matches $1 for each dollar of donation. It was supposed to end on 31 March&nbsp;– this year&nbsp;– 2020 but I strongly advocate that it be extended until the end of 2020 so that the beneficiaries whose lives depend on the money raised from well-wishers can continue to get help.</p><p>In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has done a very good job of managing COVID-19, putting all resources in finding and healing the sick. The greater challenge now is how we can pull together and help one another. Those who can must help those who cannot to tide over the economic crisis.&nbsp;The Budget has made a very good first step and the rest of the journey is for us to walk together and together we can overcome the odd.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order. I propose to take a break now. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair at 4.20 pm.</p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;Sitting accordingly suspended</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;at 4.00 pm until 4.20 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>Sitting resumed at 4.20 pm</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Deputy Speaker (Mr Lim Biow Chuan) in the Chair]</strong></p><h4 class=\"ql-align-center\">&nbsp;<strong>Debate on Annual Budget Statement</strong></h4><p>[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, from the 14th to the 15th century, wages in Europe doubled and inequality declined significantly. Inequality would not rise to the same level until the 1700s. The cause was not productivity improvements or up-skilling. Unfortunately, the cause was the Black Death, also called the plague, which killed by some estimates more than one-third of the population in Europe. The demand for labour went up and land was redistributed amongst the survivors. The plague is a zoonotic disease. The bacterium is endemic to rodents and carried by the fleas that infest rats. The plague originated in China, was carried west along the Silk Road by traders and spread thence to Europe, most famously, by Italian traders fleeing the Mongol siege of Caffa by ship.</p><p>The Plague destroyed not only populations, but also the existing social and economic order throughout Europe. Governments of the day responded with novel and extreme measures. In England, the Statute of Labourers 1351 made it illegal for workers to demand pay greater than those wages prevailing before the Plague. While there is little evidence it was effective, it appears to have contributed to a major English peasant revolt in 1381. Governments also realised, perhaps belatedly, that inequality itself weakened society\\'s ability to resist the plague. The poor could not afford treatment, but they could pose a risk to all if they contracted it. As a result, towns hired plague doctors to treat rich and poor alike without payment. Necessity is the mother of public health.</p><p>I tell this story in the hope that history does not repeat itself. But it is startling what the parallels are between the plague and COVID-19. The policy questions have changed little over the years. COVID-19 is more than a public health risk: it is a threat to the present global political, economic and social order.</p><p>China\\'s strong policy of containment has essentially decoupled China temporarily from the global economy. Singapore has suffered more than most. In 2018, 3.4 million tourist arrivals – nearly one in five that year – were from China, and China is our largest trading partner. The efforts of Budget 2020 to address the economic impact of COVID-19, and beyond that, to restructure the economy, are timely and I fully support the intent behind them.</p><p>But even if, as we hope, the impact of COVID-19 will be short-lived, it would be irrational to plan to return to the same apparently prosperous world that we inhabited just a few months ago. Countries and companies are assessing whether economies and supply chains should be so tightly coupled. So, for our part, we should take this opportunity to strengthen weaknesses in our economy and society that may yet affect the course of the outbreak and our resilience to future ones.</p><p>International experts, Mr Deputy Speaker, have judged that Singapore\\'s approach to COVID-19 is a model for public health systems worldwide. We should be proud of the hard work that our healthcare and Home Team institutions have put in to protect our society.</p><p>We can afford the tremendous costs of containing COVID-19 because we have a highly successful market-based economy. But there is a paradox there. Our efforts to contain COVID-19 now depend on many people in the frontline who have benefited much less from the market economy than others have. Our efforts also do not depend on the private healthcare sector. They instead depend on the strength of our public healthcare institutions which are paid for outside the market.</p><p>The key contradiction which the present crisis has highlighted is the growing and invidious divergence between market prices and social value. To understand this, we need to deconstruct the ideology or the myth of market forces. In crude terms, the myth is the idea that the price and distribution of goods and services, determined by competitive market processes, must be efficient and socially appropriate. This model of market forces underlies our policy thinking about economic restructuring because for the most part it works well. It is impossible to protect all jobs or industries in economic restructuring, because doing so would cripple the efficiency of the economy and harm ourselves in the long run. However, we should never assume that the market price is equivalent to social value. Market prices may be efficient, but that says little about it being equitable or socially desirable.</p><p>What comes to mind to illustrate this is how the frontlines of our war against COVID-19 have been increasingly manned by people whose market prices are low but social values immeasurable, especially during a public health crisis. Rosalind, one of the cleaners at my University, does more on a daily basis to protect our students and staff from COVID-19 than I possibly can.</p><p>She and her colleagues go into our offices and classrooms and toilets daily to make sure that they are disinfected. The cleaning frequency has been stepped up. She bears the risks of cleaning up dirt and spills and worse things and she has more work now but the same pay. Our Town Councils likewise largely depend on foreign workers and elderly local cleaners who do jobs that few of us would accept for the same pay.</p><p>This disconnect between market prices and social value is not a problem confined to those of the lowest incomes. Security officers put themselves at risk serving quarantine notices and screening for sick persons at our institutions. One such officer did, in fact, contract COVID-19. Our emergency medical responders and nurses put themselves at risk every day as their work puts them in direct physical contact with the sick. And our general practitioners (GPs) are working under very difficult circumstances to screen and treat the sick, to make the judgement call if a patient is a suspect COVID-19 case. Yet, the rewards for GPs have never been very high compared to that for specialists and surgeons, to say nothing of the pay for nurses and first responders. There may be market reasons why elective aesthetic surgery gives a doctor a much better living than primary care, but surely, there are few social reasons why this is so.</p><p>A second reason for interrogating the myth of market forces is that there is no guarantee that market prices and allocations reflect efficiency. In theory, prices in a competitive market track the marginal productivity of any resource closely. This implies the market allocation of resources should be efficient at producing the greatest useful output for society at the least cost. But this need not be true, especially once we consider the importance of resilience in maintaining social functioning in difficult times.&nbsp;</p><p>Market forces have concentrated the production of medical personal protective equipment, such as surgical masks, in a relatively small number of factories worldwide, many of them in China. Medical institutions worldwide do not keep significant reserve stocks because the supply chain is usually swift and reliable. In normal times, yes, the globalised system of production is superbly efficient. We would, in fact, question normally whether it is good value for money if MOH were to start subsidising the costly production of surgical masks in Singapore, or the creation of a stockpile that far exceeds that of projected clinical use. The COVID-19 outbreak, however, demonstrates the limitations of efficiency as the sole judgement criterion.</p><p>The Straits Times reported on 21 February, just last week, that private hospitals in Singapore have seen big drops in foreign patients. Usually, they get about 40,000 medical tourists a month. But now, many have cancelled their appointments. Now, normally, it is a good thing to have a thriving private medical sector in Singapore. It gives patients choice; it makes Singapore a medical hub. But it is likely if the COVID-19 outbreak worsens, that our GPs and public hospitals will continue to be severely stretched with a high caseload while the private specialist sector may well be short of work. This is neither resilient nor efficient. And yet, it is the market outcome, because there is market demand to pay for excess capacity in the private sector. There is none to pay for it in the public sector.</p><p>Our public healthcare system is under pressure, as are healthcare systems worldwide, to be more efficient, to cut waste and slack. To keep public healthcare prices low, we schedule appointments for subsidised healthcare as tightly as possible, to extract the most out of our manpower and equipment. This comes at a hidden cost to the resilience and morale of our healthcare workers. In a crisis, these effects become more salient. Any lack of slack means that in a crisis, we risk&nbsp;having insufficient spare capacity to deal with unexpected surges in demand. We must then rely on our healthcare workers to work overtime to keep us safe.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">China and now Korea’s experience in managing the current crisis are important reminders of how vulnerable our public healthcare system could be. We are just one unlucky \"super spreading\" incident away from severely taxing our public hospitals. To be sure, the Government has done well in planning ahead. The NCID, which has been a mainstay of our fight against COVID-19, is proof that we have taken the lessons of SARS to heart. But we must guard against the short sighted pursuit of efficiency at the expense of resilience. We may have to prepare for a new normal where increased globalisation and the disintegration of public health systems worldwide mean that we will face imported disease outbreaks more frequently than ever before.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Let me now turn to inequality, Mr Deputy Speaker. The COVID-19 outbreak is likely to hurt the livelihoods of those who already live precarious economic lives – the freelancers, the workers in small and medium enterprises. The market forces myth explains inequality through the argument that pay is equal to productivity. This in turn forces us to emphasise improving&nbsp;our productivity in order to raise wages, which in the long run is more sustainable.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">But there are any number of market distortions which would explain why the productivity-to-pay relationship, while it may hold on average and in the long run, does not always hold for the individual or even the sector. In Singapore, wages for low-income workers stagnated for much of the 2000s. The occasional paper on \"Income Growth, Inequality and Mobility Trends in Singapore\" published by MOF in 2015, documents&nbsp;that from 2004 to 2009, cumulative, per-member household income growth was only 4% for the the lowest quintile as opposed to 19.5% for the top quintile.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Were the prices right for low-wage labour in the mid-2000s? If we believe fully in price theory the answer is yes and there is nothing that can be done about it beyond Government support and transfers. But, fortunately, wiser heads prevailed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In 2012, former Chairman of the National Wages Council, Prof Lim Chong Yah, called for \"wage shock therapy\" to raise the wages of bottom income earners while freezing that at the top. While the Government did not agree with Prof Lim\\'s approach to the problem, it nonetheless worked through the tripartite framework to introduce the Progressive Wage Model, which provides an explicit framework for pushing salaries up in key low-wage sectors. We have seen a strong reversal of formerly stagnant wage growth for low-income Singaporeans. As reported in the latest Key Household Income Trends 2019, cumulative real growth in per-household member income was 29.5% and 31.8%, for the first and second deciles, from 2009 to 2019. Top decile income growth, meanwhile, slowed to 15.9%t for the same period.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Does this mean that productivity for low-wage workers has jumped by 30% over the last decade? It is difficult to take at face value without more study the price theory implication that cleaners have suddenly become hugely more productive, even with the benefit of training. I suspect it is more likely that wages were simply too low, possibly because of the easy access back then to low-wage foreign workers and our low-wage workers\\' lack of bargaining power.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In any case, the solution to being a nurse is not for that nurse to become a doctor and the solution for cleaners is not to hope that our children do not have to take up that job or to depend on an inexhaustible supply of low cost foreign labour. Society needs both nurses and doctors, cleaners and lawyers. The solution is to pay and respect low-wage workers better.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Mr Deputy Speaker, in recent days, key corporations in Singapore starting with Temasek Holdings and now including SATS, SMRT and Capitaland, and perhaps more, have decided to restructure and reduce the wages of senior management staff in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. I applaud these moves to demonstrate solidarity with Singaporeans on the ground. They are important not just for the morale of frontline staff, who may yet face cost-cutting, but also sends a signal that the risks and costs of COVID-19 should be socially distributed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Let me suggest that this year, we orient all efforts towards protecting and even increasing the wages of lower paid Singaporeans, and paying for it by restraining and restructuring the wages of those higher up – which would include, I would suggest, hon Members as leaders in their own professions. Today, we commend our cleaners and security guards, nurses and public health workers, for being in the front line of protecting us against COVID-19. We acknowledge the work of our public transport workers, our hawkers and shopkeepers, in keeping our supply lines and life running as normal. Can we give them a tangible increase in their salaries to acknowledge their sacrifices?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">If we do not have the words to express our gratitude, then at least, let us have the dollars.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">More fundamentally, COVID-19 and the demands of economic restructuring should have us question whether our social risk sharing institutions, for unemployment, housing and health care, provide sufficient protection and resilience. There was a lively debate yesterday on unemployment insurance in the Chamber and I think the discussion should continue. We cannot depend just on charity for filling in the gaps, especially since charitable activity may also be hurt by an economic or social crisis. In particular, our resilience today to major shocks such as COVID-19 depends very much on the government of the day enacting strong and tailored measures, because we do not have many automatic risk sharing measures in place. This is both a strength and a weakness because resilience depends on the performance of the political leadership of the day. Events near to us show that this cannot be guaranteed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I started this speech by noting how the Black Death fundamentally reshaped economic and social institutions in Europe. The long-run history of economic inequality is that significant reductions have only occurred in the wake of huge disasters such as the Black Death, the collapse of empires, the first and second World Wars. Left unspoken is whether inequality played a role in precipitating these collapses.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">At the moment it seems, if we are fortunate, COVID-19 will only be a shock, not a disaster, for the global economy. But we have to continue the work of strengthening and restructuring our economic, and societal institutions, to ensure that when the next test comes, Singapore will stand as resilient as it has today.&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Government’s Budget.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Senior Parliamentary Secretary Low Yen Ling.</p><h6>4.37 pm</h6><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministers for Education and Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the emergence of COVID-19 has in recent months, placed several threats in our horizon near and far. However, we take heart that since SARS, we have built up our defences and are better prepared to deal with this virus outbreak today. We are deeply thankful to our healthcare workers, government agencies, cleaners and many frontline personnel who have put their duties first, to protect us.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Apart from these, we have a strong foundation of community help and network to respond to challenges that come our way. Since its formation, the Community Development Councils or CDCs have played a critical role in partnering the community to strengthen bonds and help vulnerable groups. We have the “\"BC\" mission&nbsp;– A stands for Assist the Needy, B stands for Bond the People, C stands for Connect the Community. The mission is even more crucial than ever, in a time like this.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Each of the five CDCs – Central Singapore CDC, led by Mayor Denise Phua; Northeast CDC, led by Mayor Desmond Choo; Northwest CDC, led by Mayor Teo Ho Pin; Southeast CDC, led by Mayor Maliki Osman and Southwest CDC, helmed by myself – each of these five has its own set of local assistance schemes to meet local needs, as well as programmes to foster community development and ownership. A diverse range of partners from the community contribute to improving the welfare of the community and those in need. For example, in 2019, the CDCs rolled out 111 local assistance schemes that benefited close to 156,000 beneficiaries.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has in this year’s Budget, provided $20 million for the CDCs to better meet the needs of their residents through local initiatives. To this end, the five CDCs have been working together to launch an island-wide initiative to provide<strong> </strong>meals in the heartlands for vulnerable families. This effort not only complements the Care and Support package to help Singaporeans who need extra support with the cost of living, it will also bring business to many heartland food joints, coffeeshops which are feeling the effects of the slowdown due to&nbsp;COVID-19.<em> </em></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Yesterday,&nbsp;Member Mr Png Eng Huat had suggested that the grocery vouchers for low-income families be extended for use in small retail shops. In the past few years, our local constituencies have been working with heartland retailers and businesses to meet the nutritional needs of low-income families. The mayors and the CDCs welcome the timely $20 million injection of funds which will provide additional resources for us to scale up these efforts across the nation and reach out to more of those in need, as well as boost the support for local businesses and heartland enterprises.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The upcoming Free Meals and Drinks scheme will be redeemable at participating coffeeshops, participating food courts and participating heartland enterprises. Details are currently being worked out and will be released in due course.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The $20 million Meals in the Heartlands initiative is expected to benefit some 100,000 vulnerable families and each CDC will administer the scheme accordingly to meet the needs of its residents.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, being able to have a decent meal is a form of security and support key to boosting the resilience of families-in-need<em>.</em></p><p>Earlier, Prof Lim Sun Sun also talked about the importance of nutritional meals. These are important for the kids to start the day right. For example, the ability to have a simple breakfast of kaya toast and eggs – whether with Milo for the kids and Kopi-O for the parents – as a family can start the day right, and put parents and kids in a better mood to bond, talk and share. These kinds of moments can often be elusive for those preoccupied in making ends meet. So it is even more important for them to receive greater help in this area.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Taking a ground-up approach, the CDCs will work closely with partners in the community, merchant associations, F&amp;B outlets, self-help groups, SSOs, grassroots leaders and volunteers to form a cohesive network of support to shore up the nutritional, physical and psychological needs of this group of Singaporeans<em>.&nbsp;</em>This win-win solution not only provides businesses with additional revenue during uncertain times, it serves the families in need and brings the community closer together in mutual support.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This type of collaboration benefits the community at large and the CDCs have often involved volunteers and organisations who reach out to those in need. For instance, we have had the Central Singapore Milk fund for children; we have the NorthEast Community Vouchers; we have the NorthWest Food Aid Fund that provides food vouchers, cooked meals and food rations; we have the SouthEast Roxy Family Fund for daily expenses like diapers, food or medicine; and we have Food Connect@SouthWest and Meal Service@SouthWest.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In the coming months, we will see the CDCs widening our outreach and deepening our engagement with partners as we work together to beat the COVID-19 storm. SMEs form the lifeblood in our economy. SMEs make up 99% of our enterprises and SMEs hire close to 70% of employees in Singapore.&nbsp;Since 2013, seven years ago, CDCs have partnered Enterprise Singapore, key trade associations and business chambers to each set up an SME Centre in each of the five CDCs. The SME Centres reach out to heartland enterprises and support them through capability workshops, Government schemes, advisory services and help them improve productivity.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Last year, 6,800 SMEs benefited from the business advisory sessions from the SME@CDC centres and another 2,400 companies took part in 60 capability workshops to enhance their&nbsp;brand, productivity and marketing. The CDCs will continue to do more for our SMEs, as they face the need to constantly evolve, to stay relevant in today’s disruptive climate. From training and talent development, to business advice and community partnerships, we will continue to deepen our efforts with heartland businesses, to energise their growth and survival, for SMEs provide the majority of jobs in Singapore.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Apart from working alongside SMEs, the CDCs are dedicated to improving the future and prospects of Singaporean workers<em>. </em>In 2017, we started SkillsFuture Advice to help Singaporeans navigate their lifelong learning journey and capture opportunities to skill up with courses that they can attend with their SkillsFuture Credits. The CDCs have since surpassed the initial outreach target of 80,000 individuals in three years. By 2019, more than 100,000 Singaporeans have participated in over 3,700 SkillsFuture Workshops in the heartlands, in the community<em>.</em></p><p>Building on this strong foundation, the five CDCs look forward to closer collaborations with SSG, WSG and e2i to expand our SkillsFuture Advice outreach. All five CDCs will intensify our momentum to help Singaporeans, especially mid-career and also mature workers, to be better equipped and resourced to cope with the impact that COVID-19 may have on their careers.&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, please allow me to continue in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200227/vernacular-Low Yen Ling Budget 27Feb2020-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Neighbourhood shops and micro businesses in the heartlands are important members of our community and are important to the larger community as well. Over time, many residents and shopkeepers have become friends, and the entire neighbourhood feels like a close-knit family.</p><p>The merchants\\' associations are important organisations that represent merchants and they exist in many constituencies. Grassroots organisations, Community Development Councils and various merchant associations have always been in close communication, working together to organise various activities and events to inject vibrancy into the neighbourhoods, boosting pedestrian traffic to bring in more business.</p><p>Here, I will share an example.</p><p>In the Bukit Gombak constituency where I serve, a Chinese New Year event that is similar to the River Hongbao is organised every year. Businesses in the neighbourhood would participate in the CNY bazaar, and there would be large lantern displays and Getai to attract residents to the town centre to shop, eat and enjoy Getai performances. Both residents and neighbourhood merchants benefit from this win-win event, and I know that many constituencies have similar CNY bazaars.&nbsp;</p><p>From this example, we can see that maintaining the vibrancy of communities and neighbourhoods can help to ensure a sustainable business environment for heartland merchants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of funding, besides the $1.6-billion-dollar Care and Support Package, the Government will also set aside $20 million for ComCare schemes under the CDCs. This will allow CDCs to work with neighbourhood merchants to help low income families through their individual platforms. At the same time, this will help to boost residents’ spending at neighbourhood shops and coffee shops. More details will be revealed by the five CDCs soon.&nbsp;</p><p>The mission of the 5 CDCs is to build a caring and cohesive society, and many assistance schemes by the CDCs are people-centred. In 2019, we implemented 111 measures that helped more than 150,000 beneficiaries.</p><p>To better assist our neighbourhood shops in achieving success, the CDCs, Enterprise Singapore, trade associations and merchant associations have banded together to set up SME centres to provide advisory services for heartland merchants. In 2019, about 6,800 shops have made use of this advisory service. Another 2,400 small and micro businesses have also participated in workshops to improve their operations, management and promotion strategies.</p><p>Although large merchants have the advantage of providing new and diversified offerings, neighbourhood merchants have the advantage of providing personalized services, as well as friendships and mutual understanding with customers built over the years. I think this is extremely valuable.</p><p>&nbsp;People say that there will be businesses for shops as long as the community is vibrant. One crucial factor is taking proactive measures to drive customer traffic in the neighbourhood. It is the shared responsibility of everyone to ensure that the community and neighbourhood remain vibrant, to build a pro-people, pro-business and friendly neighbourhood.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the months ahead may hold uncertainties, we can be sure that on the ground, the five CDCs are fortifying the network of support across the heartlands and strengthening our local businesses, our vulnerable families and Singaporean workers. With concerted and specific measures as well as fresh resources, we are closing ranks with fellow Singaporeans and heartland enterprises as well as local businesses.</p><p>As we fight back, as we steady our ship, as we hold our ground, we can get through this together. For no matter what the odds may be, we stand as one – SG United – overcomers, to emerge even stronger.&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support Budget 2020. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><h6>4.51 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Ong Teng Koon (Marsiling-Yew Tee)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, this year’s Budget debate is taking place under the dark clouds caused by a global pandemic. But Singaporeans can take heart that we are better placed than almost any other country to deal with this crisis and to mitigate its impact. The Government has gone all out to address the potential fall-out from COVID-19, and my residents would like to express their thanks to the Government for this Budget and all the help that has been offering. My residents have also asked me to express thanks to our frontline workers whose bravery, commitment and calmness have inspired all of us to carry on.</p><p>However, COVID-19 is a once-in-a-decade threat to the economy and the full effects are not even apparent yet. Even if it does not get worse, it has already blasted a hole in the world’s supply chain. Chinese manufacturers have shut down for a month and many industries are hurt because of lower Chinese demand and because of the broken Chinese supply chain.</p><p>To cushion the impact on local businesses, the Government has introduced a comprehensive set of measures in this year\\'s Budget. Protecting businesses means protecting jobs and protecting families. This is why I support the Government’s efforts to inject additional stimulus in the economy. I am especially appreciative of the Stabilisation and Support Package where $4 billion will be made available to local businesses to tide over short-term dislocations, and the Transformation and Growth Strategy where $8.3 billion will be made available to local businesses to position for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, nevertheless, I would like to make four additional suggestions for the Government to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first point relates to feedback from the SME community. The Stabilisation and Support Package will help small enterprises but it is really too small for medium enterprises. There is a \"sandwich\" class of companies where it is too big for such small help to matter but too small to survive for long periods of negative cash flows. The Corporate Income Tax rebate of 25% of tax payable is a welcome measure, but it is capped at $15,000. This is a small drop in the ocean for such companies. Even a $600,000 loan guarantee by the Government may not be enough for a medium enterprise whose revenue may be up to in the region of $50 million to $100 million a year. I would like to urge the Government to calibrate and scale this assistance according to the size of the company.</p><p>The second question relates to the timing of the help. What can the Government do to speed up cash flow assistance to these companies? It has been almost six weeks since the virus started to impact travel and commerce. Many businesses are already running down on their reserves and they cannot depend on their suppliers to extend credit because their supplies are similarly impacted. Cash flow is the lifeline of every business. From what I heard from the banks, it will take until mid-March to approve new loans and these loans will not be disbursed until mid-April. For some, this will be too late. So, I would like to ask the Government what more can we do to open the spigot to make sure that these companies do not go down because of the virus in the short term.</p><p>The third point relates to what we must do to prevent short-term pain becoming chronic, in the form of long-term unemployment among mature PMETs. If companies go under because of COVID-19, many jobs will disappear and may never come back. Even if they come back, they might on to a different, younger crowd. Employment for mature PMETs exhibits a ratchet effect. It only goes one direction. It is much easier for a mature PMET to lose a job than to be hired back into one.</p><p>So, therefore the emphasis on SkillsFuture 2, SkillsFuture Entreprise Credit and the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package in this year’s Budget is therefore much welcomed. I am also gratified to learn from the Deputy Prime Minister Budget speech that in the last three years, productivity has risen by 2.6% per year and real median income has risen by 3.6% per year. These are positive developments for the Singaporean worker. But I would also like to ask how we can get Singaporeans to do the relevant training, instead of spending their SkillsFuture money on new skills and interests that might not help them to stay employed.&nbsp;</p><p>I totally agree with the Deputy Prime Minister when he said that enterprises know best what are the skills needed for their businesses to transform. But, under the Enhanced Training Support for SMEs, the Government already pays for 90% of the course fee and 80% of worker’s salary while employees are undergoing training. Minister Josephine Teo also said in her speech that funding is not the constraint or the impediment that is preventing workers from getting training. But I know that SMEs are not willing or are unwilling to send their workers because it is just too difficult for them to take their workers away from day-to-day work. Therefore, the new SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit that is capped at $10,000 per year, I feel might see a very low take-up rate.</p><p>I would like to suggest for the Government to intensify efforts to help businesses to find replacement manpower to cover their employees when they are undergoing training. And this might even include having to pay the salary of such temporary replacement. I think this would encourage upskill their workers while not compromising their day-to-day activities.</p><p>Residents have also given feedback that it is difficult to get placement into the Professional Conversion Programmes which operate on a \"place and train\" basis. Place and train means that you have to get placed in a job first before you can undergo training. But it creates a catch-22 situation for mature PMETs. They need the training to get a job, but need to get the job to get the training. So, they are stuck. I would urge the Government to provide more than the hiring incentive of 20% salary, capped at six months that is announced in the Budget, in order to further incentivise companies to make the first move.</p><p>The fourth point is what do we do for the longer term, how do we increase the resilience of our economy and our workforce?&nbsp;A key lesson learnt from the COVID-19 virus is that even when you have money, you cannot buy a mask.&nbsp;Similarly, in the area of manpower, we need to build up our self-sufficiency. We need to reconsider outsourcing.</p><p>I would encourage the Government to identify areas of critical need or essential services, and to build up a core of local talent.&nbsp;The speed and ability of GovTech to swing into action and update from \"gov.sg\" or \"maskgowhere\"&nbsp;is testament that in-house ability matters in times of crisis. Another example would be the need for experienced engineering tech talent, experienced engineering staff during the SMRT crisis in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>It might be cheaper to outsource in the short term, but the strategic value of insourcing would be very apparent and outweigh the cost when disaster hits.</p><p>One way of doing so is to build up a local eco-system of SMEs with the requisite local expertise to operate these industries to become our version of Mittelstand.&nbsp;Germany has its famous Mittelstand&nbsp;– the heart of German industry. The unifying mindset is a focus on social, inter-generational and community responsibility. Mittelstand companies contribute to the local economic and social welfare. They also offer stability and loyalty to their staff by investing heavily in training and retaining staff in times of crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>This stands in contrast to the more common Western style of capitalism, with an exclusive focus on profits.&nbsp;Their overriding obligation is to their shareholders, not to other stakeholders like workers. This \"winner takes all\" mentality might have also contributed to the growing inequality problem that we see in the world today.</p><p>From a societal perspective, it is not always clear that unbridled capitalism will lead to the best outcome. Perhaps it is time for us to explore how we can build a core of locally-anchored, stakeholder-conscious Singapore businesses that can help our economy in both good times and bad times.</p><p>Singapore already has many of the ingredients to cultivate our own Mittelstand eco-system. We are uniquely placed to work together as a government and as a society to achieve a bold vision. Enterprise Singapore and the private sector can work together to identify the right industries. EDB can can bring these businesses to Singapore.</p><p>Innovation can be driven by research and academic institutions, with funding from NRF and RIE, and there can be tripartite collaboration with the unions to make sure that our workers have a voice. Trade associations can also help to mobilise the workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Our emphasis on lifelong learning will provide a skilled workforce of craftsmen and domain experts. Perhaps what we really need is for the Government to invest in a Mittelstand fund or to start a Mittelstand development bank to catalyse the entire SME eco-system. Give it an inspiring name, articulate the bold vision, set an ambitious timeline and make it happen. Let us show our pioneering spirit once again. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Budget.</p><h6>5.02 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this year’s Budget is set in one of the most uncertain times of Singapore’s history. Our economy grew by a modest 0.7% in 2019, its weakest growth since 2008 Financial Crisis.&nbsp;With the current COVID-19 outbreak fast spreading across the world, the outlook for 2020 is even more bleak and uncertain.</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has provided much-needed assurance, by announcing a rock-solid Budget that inspires confidence to press ahead. People say money cannot buy happiness.&nbsp;But I can think of&nbsp;many things money, in the right hands, can provide:&nbsp;peace of mind, opportunities to better one’s circumstances&nbsp;and hope for the future. Budget 2020 offers us that. Let me elaborate.</p><p>Singapore’s economic foundations have been and continue to be strong. The fiscal strength has enabled Deputy Prime Minister to announce one of the most expansionary Budgets in 20 years – $106 billion to support families, seniors, workers and businesses.&nbsp;Budget 2020 will provide \"Stabilisation and Support\" for the current COVID-19 outbreak, enable Singapore to seize opportunities to transform and grow, as well as to build and secure our future.</p><p>The money will come from diversified sources of tax, Net Investment Return Contributions (NIRC) from our reserves as well as accumulated surplus from previous years’ fiscal prudence and discipline. It is at times like these when we really appreciate having this reservoir of financial resources to keep Singapore on an even keel, come what may.</p><p>It is at times like these when we should also reflect on the significant contributions made by NIRC. Its contribution to fund total expenditure has grown from 13% in 2015, it is now 22% in 2020&nbsp;– projected to be 22% in 2020. So, in five short years, it has gone from 13% to 22%. Besides being the single largest source of revenue, NIRC is also projected to grow at 9.3%, compared to only 1.7% total increase in all the taxes in FY2020.</p><p>I am worried about calls from some quarters for the Government to take more from our reserves, rather than to safeguard our strategic \"asset\". Is it not unwise to kill the \"goose that lays the golden egg”?</p><p>I am even more worried about the growing dependency on NIRC. As NIRC, we know, is subject to volatility from tough investment environments, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether it might be prudent to consider setting a threshold on NIRC dependency, beyond which recurrent spending should only be funded through recurrent revenue.</p><p>I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for responding to my call to delay increase in GST.&nbsp;Whilst he has assured us that GST will not increase for at least another two years and has also provided support in the form of GST Assurance Package, some Singaporeans are still wondering why would we need to raise GST at all, given the apparent budget surpluses and additional capacity of $6 billion of GST offsets?&nbsp;Increases in cost of living is foremost in the minds of many people, particularly retirees.</p><p>Sir, I would like to repeat my call to the Deputy Prime Minister to continue looking for other sources of revenue. Even though the wealthy are already contributing substantially to our taxes through a progressive Personal Income Tax, GST, property tax, ABSD and so on, I really believe there is still room to consider wealth tax and estate duties – all aimed at building an even fairer and more equal society.</p><p>Some may be concerned that a re-introduction of estate duties, previously abolished in 2008, may harm Singapore\\'s status as a leading wealth management centre and incentivise wealth and business owners to engage in complex structures for tax avoidance.&nbsp;As other forms of wealth taxation are now being considered by a number of other countries, the notion of wealth taxes generally do give rise to concerns about how taxpayers might react.</p><p>But income and wealth inequality are global issues and there are wide recognition amongst governments and wealth and business owners of the need to address them. As the world moves towards considering broader and fairer tax systems, Singapore should maintain its principles of keeping tax structures simple and tax rates low whilst meeting the interests of all stakeholders, particularly of those who are most in need.</p><p>So, now we live in a new era of automatic information exchange under the Common Reporting Standard and other global requirements to disclose beneficial ownership across the world. Transparency in ownership and value of assets is rapidly becoming a new norm.</p><p>When tax is well structured at competitive and fair rates, together with tax treaties similar to those to which other jurisdictions are parties, an effective estate duty and, perhaps, accompanying wealth tax regime may actually be an allure for assets to be maintained in Singapore.</p><p>In a world of turbulence and uncertainty, Singapore\\'s world class infrastructure, rule of law, financial and political stability is priceless for the peace of mind of the wealthy. This is especially so when the environment in Hong Kong, Asia\\'s other leading wealth management centre, has been marred by months of street protests and instability, and long-term uncertainties regarding its tax and legal systems.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister Heng for a very generous Budget with measures to help with cost of living, training, jobs and retirement adequacy. Whilst there is a really \"feel good\" sentiment on the ground, more needs to be done to help Singaporeans understand exactly how these measures will benefit them. And I am picking this up when I am on the ground trying to explain.</p><p>There are many different schemes to keep track of, from the new schemes such as Care and Support Package, Matched Retirement Savings Scheme, GST Assurance Package; to enhancements to existing programmes such as the Silver Support Scheme and SkillsFuture top-ups. On top of existing support programmes, they all have very different qualifying criteria, some based on housing type, individual income, household income, age criteria and often combinations of criteria.</p><p>And I do agree these multi-faceted targeted schemes are more cost effective than broad based ones, but together they can become too complex for the average person on the street to digest.&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Government provide a Personalised Budget Statement or make available a Budget Calculator on how Singaporeans and their family, based on their unique circumstances, can stand to benefit from Budget 2020.</p><p>Sir, regarding support for businesses, I urge the Deputy Prime Minister Heng to really stand ready to do more. The coronavirus outbreak has hit the businesses hard. The general feedback is that many businesses are experiencing up to 50% drop from their usual volume, and the Budget measures are too small and too short term to address these challenges.</p><p>Besides the dramatic impact on tourism, aviation and retail sectors, COVID-19 has significantly disrupted supply chains in manufacturing to even vegetables for the restaurants. Locked-down Chinese cities are unable to supply the parts that&nbsp;have become integral components of the supply chains here. Many workers are stuck in&nbsp;China, unable to return.&nbsp;Activation of Business Continuity Plans, extra cleaning, medical leave, leave of absence and so on have put additional pressure on costs and manpower.</p><p>It will be especially crucial, I agree with Member Ong Teng Koon, to provide relief for cash flows to tide them over this difficult period. With $7.7 billion of budget surplus left for this term of government to tap on, Deputy Prime Minister Heng has ample ammunition to do more, I hope. I would like to ask if he would consider a second package if circumstances warrant it?</p><p>Would the Deputy Prime Minister consider extending the Jobs Support Scheme to six months and increase offset of wages to 12%, as what was done during the Global Financial Crisis? Would he consider extending the support package to more sectors?&nbsp;Would he also consider coordinating efforts with banks to restructure loans, so that SMEs and affected individuals can get moratorium on repayments for, say, up to six months, just to ease the cashflow?</p><p>In the meantime, it is heartening to see large corporations and landlords rise to the occasion in support of the smaller ones – including rental rebates by Changi Airport Group to retailers and the Hope fund, put together by the Young Business Leaders of SBF, to support SMEs with immediate working capital. This is the time for the big boys to chip in and help their smaller brothers.</p><p>Sir, long-term transformation and growth remain the key focus of this Budget. The issue of manpower constraint continues to be a major struggle for businesses across the board, even as we are resolved to reducing our dependency on foreign workers. We need to urgently develop new ways to find, train and retain the talent necessary to sustain growth.</p><p>Learning from the Swiss, industry associations can play a pivotal role in galvanising players in the sector to join forces in curating and delivering impactful training for the industry. I believe that Singaporeans will become more accepting of supplementary foreign labour if we actualise the systematic plan to train and develop them for attractive careers.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, finally, Budget 2020 showcases Singapore\\'s capacity to build a bright and sustainable future. Deputy Prime Minister had set ambitious goal to tackle climate change and has put aside a $5 billion Coastal and Flood Protection Fund. The spark in Singapore\\'s climate change journey has been lit in this Budget. Singaporeans can look forward to a sustainable future and participate in exciting new developments as we manage Singapore\\'s transition to a low carbon, low emissions, clean economy.</p><p>In conclusion, Budget 2020 inspires confidence in uncertain times.&nbsp;It has provided Singaporeans&nbsp;with peace of mind, ample opportunities and a sustainable future. The concerns over COVID-19 will eventually fade over time, but the efforts to transform Singapore as a Global-Asia Node of Technology, Innovation and Enterprise will ensure Singapore remains exceptional. I cannot agree more with the Deputy Prime Minister Heng, when he says that the Singapore Spirit is strong and growing. Together, we will advance, as One Singapore. I support the Budget.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker:&nbsp;</strong>Mr Christopher de Souza.</p><h6>5.15 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I had my speech finalised on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, I found out that I was speaker number 48 out of 48. What can you say after a list of 47 esteemed speakers? So, I decided to rework my speech.</p><p>The past two days\\' speeches&nbsp;– many made passionately&nbsp;– reminded me of a BBC documentary which I had listened to last month while I was on the way to work. The documentary was called \"disagreeing better\". No. It was not a guide about how to better disagreements. Rather, it was a guide about how to resolve disagreements better. Hence, the title \"disagreeing better\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Why is this relevant at all? Because the documentary touched on the negative repercussions on societies when they are polarised. The danger the BCC documentary sought to point out is the very danger so many of us in this House seek to battle. In short, in Singapore, we do things quite differently. We seek unity here. Hence, the Unity Budget.</p><p>Why is this important, especially at this time? Because the crisis can bring out the best or the worst in society.&nbsp;</p><p>Will there be disagreements along the way? Of course. These will relate to fiscal measures, social policy and issues of societal values. But how we resolve these differences – and come out of a large crisis or mini crisis – is key. The willingness to listen, to be open with each other, to share and risk empathy; and then to decide. These are all essential for an efficient decision-making body and have been so aptly displayed by so many of the 47 speakers before me. So many of us in the Chamber regard the unity of Singapore and the united response to the crisis as the priority.</p><p>Ms Jessica Tan gave real life examples from her constituency as to why providing opportunities in education is key. Ms Denise Phua shared how these opportunities should be extended to SMEs. Mr Desmond Choo talked about giving working mothers and mothers on maternity the best shot in their careers.&nbsp;</p><p>And you see characteristics of each in Budget 2020 – the umbrella of opportunities for re-skilling, re-training and advancement for the Singaporean workforce. You see the undercurrent of unity in so many of the speeches. You see that in Mr Png Eng Huat\\'s speech where he talked about the need to unite rather than point fingers and stigmatise, how we should not ostracise China, and that it was good that we sent them a second humanitarian shipment.</p><p>So, the BBC documentary sought to point to the danger of disunity. Yet, in this House, through the 47 speeches before me, you see an over-arching priority to unite, and I think that is quite novel in the world today. And it is, in fact, inspiring and encouraging. Hence, Unity Budget.&nbsp;</p><p>If we look at the globe, there is sectarianism, I versus you, hardly any effort to build the common ground or common paths forward. Yet, so many of the speeches in this debate here have had as their foundation the topic of unity.</p><p>But it is not only about unity. There is also the need for transparency, honesty – as Mr Cedric Foo emphasised; and being open with difficult facts too. A \"framework of honesty\", if you like. And I see how that framework is being deployed in the Budget. For example, being upfront with Singaporeans early about the future hike in GST, being open about why over reliance on the NIRC may not be fiscally prudent and why at this stage, we need to think of raising GST in the future.</p><p>This is being open and mature. It makes for the politics of trust and honesty. It makes for a reliable decision-making process.</p><p>If I may be bold enough to say, it is the same framework that we see being deployed within the COVID-19 taskforce – sharing the infections numbers, the discharged numbers, the ICU numbers, sharing information about the clusters and importantly, readying Singaporeans for the method we will use to deal with the virus in the longer time, whichever of the scenarios plays out.&nbsp;</p><p>So, as with Budget 2020, as with the debate of the 47 speakers before me, as with the manner in which the Ministerial taskforce in COVID-19 is addressing the difficulties facing our country today – facts discussed candidly and openly, and a sharing of ideas and suggestions and then, importantly, decisions. This is what we are doing in this Chamber. This is our Singapore way.&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore is like a steady ship in the ocean. We have gone through storms together before and we can go through them again.</p><p>Perhaps, in this moment of the COVID-19 outbreak, we should also take the opportunity to try to remove the hierarchical way that some in our society view jobs and professions, with certain professions viewed as more prestigious while others jobs viewed as less dignified. In my view, such stratification is not the way it should be. This was also a point raised by Prof Yaacob and Mr Alex Yam, and I agree with them. If anything, the COVID-19 crisis is proof to all of us that everyone is important – everyone has a role to play – everyone is needed.</p><p>&nbsp;Allow me to explain. In order to stem the spread of the&nbsp;COVID-19 virus, office buildings carry out temperature taking. Those manning the temperature booths, often security guards, are important as they provide a first line of defence. But the guards are putting themselves at risk. Other measures that have been taken are the increased cleaning and disinfecting of places, such as playgrounds and high touch points, such as lifts and hotel rooms. Our housekeeping staff, uncles and aunties in the hotel industries, frontline staff, cleaners – they all play such an important role in the prevention of the spread of the virus. Many have had to work overtime due to the crisis to meet the increased rate of cleaning common areas. And yes, these diligent and determined workers also put themselves at risk.</p><p>In a Straits Times\\' interview entitled, \"Coronavirus: It’s a dirty job,&nbsp;but if I don’t do it, who will?\", one of the cleaning companies has had their teams work seven days a week these few weeks, all hands on deck, including the manager Mdm Tay. I quote from the article, \"Few Singaporeans are interested in working in the cleaning industry, but Madam Tay hopes that through the work they do – especially during this outbreak – people will learn to respect the job. We are helping to prevent the spread of the virus in Singapore\\'.\", says Mdm Tay.</p><p>The immigration officers are on the front line, so are the enforcement operations managers of MOM. The nurses and those working at the service counters at hospitals and healthcare institutions play a crucial and important role. Their professionalism is inspiring.&nbsp;</p><p>All workers on the frontline should be appreciated. None of us asked for this to happen. None of us want this to happen. But since it has happened, we need all hands on deck. There should be an appreciation that everyone, even those who play less visible roles, are important to our society. We should be less focused on hierarchy and more focused on appreciating each member of our society, especially as we battle COVID-19 in a singular and united determination. And I hope that we will also retain this experience, that everyone in our society is important, even after we overcome this crisis, as we forge our collective future.</p><p>Sir, even as we are in a ship together, we need to ensure that the Budget has in place measures that are of practical help to our people.&nbsp;This is especially important to the hotel, tourism and food and beverage industry. According to a snap survey done by Restaurant Association Singapore, close to 60% of restaurants in Singapore stated that they are not prepared and equipped enough to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 on their operations. For those who rely heavily on tourists, the estimated loss could go up to 80%.</p><p>To help the food and services sector during this period, the Adapt and Grow initiative was expanded. In relation to rental costs, for food and beverage and retailers, it is good that there are full month rental waivers for some hawkers and half a month of rental waivers for commercial tenants of Government agencies. However, for those on private property, it is the landlords of those retailers on private properties who are given property tax rebates and encouraged to pass on to the retailers.&nbsp;Instead of relying on the goodwill of landlords to pass on savings to their lessees, is there no other more direct way we can alleviate the challenges that those in the food and beverage industry are facing? For example, will the Ministry consider requiring landlords to declare whether they have passed on the rebate to their lessees? And if so, how much has been passed down in dollar terms? Already, it has been reported by the Restaurant Association Singapore that 200,000 employees have been affected since the outbreak.</p><p>As Business Continuity Plans already need to be in place, it may also be a good opportunity for businesses to test and hopefully prove that flexible working arrangements work. If it works, more firms may be ready and confident to try adopting it as an available standard practice to support our working parents with\\tyoung children\\tand working care-givers. For\\tsome\\tof the enterprises who want to take this opportunity to change the way they work, this Enterprise SkillsFuture Credit&nbsp;may come in useful.</p><p>Furthermore, in relation to using this crisis as a place to plan for the future, there is one particular area that we have announced our intention to look for new sources of\\tsupply\\tand look into the capabilities\\tfor\\tlocal manufacturing, that, is, masks. It would be especially useful since epidemics will spread between countries more quickly. But the issue of masks\\talso points to a larger priority, namely, the diversification of our supply sources.</p><p>I have spoken\\tabout\\tfood security before.\\tCurrently, the coronavirus or COVID-19 is affecting the world\\ttrade of\\tgoods\\tand supplies.</p><p>In light of this, we need to take stock of what other items, besides masks, we potentially need to&nbsp;manufacture on our own in the future, and if we do&nbsp;manufacture them, whether our supply sources for the materials are sufficiently diverse.</p><p>Secondly, for our businesses who are facing problems with diversification of supply sources, what support from the Government is available for them to facilitate the making and establishing of connections with more diverse trade partners?</p><p>Budget 2020 also has its eye on the future.\\tBusinesses&nbsp;have\\tbeen\\tgiven\\tincentive\\tmeasures\\tto\\ttake\\tthis opportunity to re-skill and re-train workers to increase future productivity. We also need, however, to instill measures that make learning something that is embedded in the way things are done in Singapore, long term. This is crucial as we are facing an economy characterised by disruptive technology. Change will come. Just like COVID-19 presented itself to us as a disruption, or another phrase by Deputy Prime Minister Heng, as \"a spur and a test\" that COVID-19 has presented to us, we cannot run away from such a change, disruption, spur or test.</p><p>We need to change the way we think about learning. Year after year, we cite the Chinese saying, live until old, learn until old, that is, lifelong learning. We learn that in Primary schools too. But, do we really live it? Do we see learning as a chore rather than a joy? Do we see learning as a burden rather than a privilege? I would like to suggest that we think about the way we can build lifelong learning into the curriculum of students. It is not just a good attitude to have in life but necessary in the kind of economy&nbsp;Singaporeans will face in the future.</p><p>A good example of what could be done is what is already being done at SMU. We could broaden what is being done at SMU.</p><p>At SMU, disruption is built into part of the syllabus through the way the core curriculum is designed. The core curriculum has three pillars: capabilities, communities and civilisations.</p><p>Under capabilities, students pick up skills, such as numeracy and management lessons, to navigate the modern world. Internships are integrated with the other pillars, with a work-study scheme available so students can take up longer internships and earn credits at the same time. Under communities, students discover Singapore\\'s Asian context through courses under the areas of economy and society, technology and society, cultures of the modern world and community service.&nbsp;</p><p>SMU\\'s core curriculum was designed to nurture a generation of \"adaptive and adroit graduates who are technically competent and agile, socially conscious and adept in their communities and inspired by the timeless puzzles and challenges confronting humanity.\" This instills in students the aptitude for and attitude of lifelong learning. That is something other schools could consider so that the students will not be theorists only but be able to handle both theory and practical, having the dexterity&nbsp;to apply strong foundations of theory into new real-world applications.</p><p>Sir, I move on to my third and last topic&nbsp;– climate change –\\tand why I stand in strong support of the $5 billion set aside to shore up our coastal defences.</p><p>Although there are some in Singapore who disagree with the use of the phrase \"climate change\" as they are of the view that the climate is and always has been changing, allow me to just use the phrase to point out some trends we should be concerned with, particularly relating to the rise in sea levels. Historical data measuring average sea levels of the Singapore Strait from four research-quality data points at Tanjong Pagar, Raffles Lighthouse, Sultan Shoal and Sembawang, indicate that there was a 2.9 mm yearly increase of our sea levels from 1984 to 2011. So, sea levels have risen and ice in the ocean has been melting and physics will say that there will be an increase in sea levels.</p><p>What this means is that low-lying small nations such as the Maldives and Tuvalu may face, or in fact, are facing existential crisis.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr de Souza, you have three minutes more.</p><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza</strong>: I will take two, Sir. Leaving one spare. Thank you.</p><p>Because of the dire consequences rising sea levels have on Singapore\\'s future, it is good that the Budget takes these longer term challenges into account and prepares for them. The $5 billion investment to ameliorate the effect that sea levels have on Singapore is thus commendable and far-sighted.&nbsp;</p><p>In my speech, Sir, I compared Singapore to a steady ship in the ocean. As a country, we have weathered storms together.\\tThe Budget Statement and the debate on it are important to train our focus on how to ensure we get through the storm as one united people. As Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat wrote in his Facebook the day before he delivered the speech, \"we\\twould not\\thave\\tbeen\\table\\tto\\tact\\tquickly\\tand decisively, if not for our deep reserves. I do not mean only our financial reserves... I also mean the reserves of\\tstrength,\\tresilience,\\tempathy and resourcefulness among our public servants and fellow Singaporeans\".</p><p>It is such resilience that allows us to plan well into the future, well beyond this storm. It is our Singapore way –\\tresponding as one people, tirelessly safeguarding our country’s reserves and future. It is for these reasons, that I stand in support of the Motion.&nbsp;[<em>Applause</em>.]</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Leader of the House.</p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>2 <strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) for each month from 1 January 2018, how many cars have been registered under the Vehicle Emission Schemes in the A1, A2, B, C1 and C2 bands respectively; and (b) whether the Ministry will start collecting such data if it does not currently do so.</p><p><strong>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M</strong>:&nbsp;The Vehicular Emissions Scheme (VES) has been implemented for all new cars, taxis and newly imported cars since January 2018. It assesses vehicles on five key pollutants – carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM).

       " 'content': '<p><strong>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister-in-charge of Strategy Group (Mr Heng Swee Keat)</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed the gravest challenge for Singapore since independence. We are confronting an unprecedented public health as well as economic crisis, with serious social consequences. To get through the crisis and to emerge stronger and better, a concerted whole-of-society response needs to be led by the Government, with all Singaporeans playing their part. This in turn requires a well-coordinated Whole-of-Government effort, to navigate our way through the crisis, and to build back a better Singapore post-crisis. In this challenging and uncertain environment, the Strategy Group organises the Public Service to develop and implement the Government\\'s key policy priorities, in a coherent and coordinated manner.</p><p>The Government\\'s management of the COVID-19 pandemic is led by the Multi-Ministry Task Force. Beyond this, the Government also needs to adjust its policy responses to the new challenges and opportunities that have arisen from this crisis. The pandemic has exacerbated geopolitical tensions, and altered the regional and global economic landscape. A comprehensive review of the Government\\'s medium-term policy agenda is needed, in order to tackle new challenges but also seize new opportunities, so that Singapore can manage this crisis well, and continue to thrive in a post-COVID-19 world.</p><p>In the midst of crisis, the Strategy Group will organise the cross-Ministry effort to review our policy agenda and set new ambitions for our future. Even as we support businesses and workers to cope with the severe disruption to our economy, work is underway with economic agencies to look ahead in partnership with businesses, to identify and seize new growth opportunities for businesses and create new good jobs for Singaporeans. We will work with social agencies to review our social support policies in the light of the impact of COVID-19, especially to help vulnerable groups that have been more adversely affected. This will form the basis of a refreshed social compact. Given that climate change is also a storm of great proportions, we will also review our infrastructure plans for a sustainable city, taking into consideration new industry needs and emerging new norms of working and living.</p><p>Tackling these complex challenges will require closer alignment across different policy areas, stronger sense-making capabilities, and effective implementation of the policy agenda. We will have tighter co-ordination between our economic and social policies, to ensure that Singaporeans can access jobs and opportunities in the post-COVID-19 economy, with vulnerable groups of workers receiving additional support, and social mobility continuing to be a feature of our society. To strengthen our sense-making capabilities, we are growing new capabilities in data analytics and citizen engagement to better understand the concerns of our citizens, so that we can develop better, more citizen-centric policies. Finally, we will set the pace for the effective implementation of these policies across the Whole-of-Government through close monitoring of implementation plans and outcomes, and ensuring that strategic priorities are given the support and resourcing needed to succeed.</p><p>Singapore continues to face stark demographic realities, including low birth rates and an ageing population. Local workforce growth will slow over the next decade. COVID-19 has intensified some of these challenges, for example with couples delaying their marriage and parenthood plans.</p><p>The Government remains committed to keeping Singaporeans at the heart of our population strategies. Our population policies aim to ensure a sustainable Singapore with a cohesive society and vibrant economy that improves Singaporeans\\' lives. We will continue to support Singaporeans in their parenthood aspirations and support families especially in housing, preschool, parental leave, and the cost of raising children. We will also partner with employers and the community to cushion the impact of COVID-19 on the marriage and parenthood plans of young couples.</p><p>We will continue to take a calibrated approach to immigration and maintain a careful balance in our foreign worker flows. We welcome those who can contribute to our society and want to make Singapore their home, while ensuring that our policies allow Singaporeans to benefit from better jobs and opportunities. To build a cohesive society, we will strengthen efforts to integrate new members of our community and help them adapt to the Singaporean way of life.</p><p>We must manage the disruptions caused by climate change, which may be more protracted than the impact of COVID-19. We must continue with efforts to enable Singapore\\'s transition to a sustainable, low-carbon, and climate and resource resilient future.</p><p>To do so, we will continue to actively support global climate action, as no one country can prevent climate change alone. Earlier this year, Singapore submitted our enhanced 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LEDS) to underscore our commitment to continued global climate action. Notwithstanding the disruptions and uncertainties brought about by COVID-19, we remain committed to achieve these goals. To enable our low-carbon transition, we are among other initiatives, studying ways to deploy technologies such as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS), exploring the use of hydrogen, and pushing the bounds of ambition in solar deployment within our urban environment.</p><p>The fundamental shifts to a post-COVID-19 \"new normal\" also present new opportunities to advance our sustainability agenda. We will study green recovery pathways to rebuild our economy, in line with our long-term low-emissions aspirations, so that we not only emerge stronger but also advance our sustainability agenda. We will catalyse and generate new green growth areas for Singapore and create new jobs for Singaporeans. We will build resilience to future crises and supply shocks, such as by enhancing our food security, in a resource efficient manner. We will build on the adaptations that Singaporeans have made during this period of COVID-19, to reduce transport emissions through increased telecommuting and wider use of public transport, and make a decisive move to adopt cleaner energy vehicles such as electric vehicles.</p><p>Over the years, this Government has maintained focus on serving Singaporeans well both today and in the long term. Our capability in long-term strategic planning and foresight has served us well, and will remain essential as we navigate this crisis and chart our path beyond. We have outlined the broad strategies we will adopt, including for population and climate action, and the relevant agencies have provided more details on specific plans under their charge.</p><p>But the Government cannot achieve this alone. More than ever, Government, individuals, communities, and businesses must each do our part and work together, to overcome the pandemic and build a better and stronger post-COVID-19 future. As part of the SG Together movement, we will work with Singaporeans and businesses to develop new ideas and translate them into action, through the Emerging Stronger Conversations, SG Together Action Networks and Alliances for Action. The Strategy Group will play its part in strengthening partnerships, especially in the areas of parenthood and climate change.</p><p>In responding to the immense challenges at hand, and shaping our plans for tomorrow, we look forward to Singaporeans partnering with the Government to realise our hopes and dreams for a better Singapore.</p>',\n",

Your firmness in discharging your duties has also enabled smooth and orderly proceedings in this House. I have every confidence and trust that the good standing of this House will continue to be maintained under your Speakership.</p><p>Sir, you will be Speaker of Parliament that is sitting in extraordinary times and has its work cut out for it.&nbsp;While our COVID-19 situation is under control, the need for vigilance remains to prevent recurring waves of infections as we have seen in other countries – indeed, the fact that this evening’s Sitting is in two locations is a testament to this.&nbsp;As we redouble our efforts to see Singapore through this crisis, we must also not lose sight of our longer term goal of building a better Singapore – an economy that serves as a global-Asia node and continues to create good jobs; a liveable city equipped to adapt to the effects of climate change; and a caring and inclusive society where every Singaporean can achieve his or her full potential, regardless of starting point.&nbsp;</p><p>As we deal with our internal challenges, we must also continue to secure Singapore’s position as a trusted and valued partner in the region and the world, amidst an increasingly uncertain global environment.</p><p>Sir, the issues that this House will consider over the next five years will be increasingly complex, with no textbook answers or model solutions. We will have to find our way, create solutions suited to our unique context while holding fast to the values that define us as Singaporeans. We welcome sincere and rigorous debate from Members on both sides of the House – be it new ideas and policy proposals, or the difficult decisions that have to be taken and trade-offs that have to be made.&nbsp;</p><p>In this Parliament, we have, for the first time, an officially designated Leader of the Opposition. May I take this opportunity to formally congratulate Mr Pritam Singh. I look forward to working with him in this new term of Parliament.</p><p>Sir, Parliament is more than a place where laws are made. It is a place where the aspirations of a nation are articulated and made real.</p><p>This must be a House with a heart that cares, a voice of reason and a place of courage to do what is right, all conducted with the necessary dignity and decorum. Over this, Mr Speaker, you will preside.</p><p>Once again, my heartiest congratulations.&nbsp;[<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Pritam Singh.</p><h6>6.14 pm</h6><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Pritam Singh)</strong>: Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Workers\\' Party Members of Parliament and the Progress Singapore Party Non-Constituency Members of Parliament, congratulations on your re-election of Speaker of Parliament.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Since your election as Speaker in 2017, you have given the Workers\\' Party Members of Parliament appropriate time to engage the government of the day on the issues that matter. We trust that you will continue in the same vein.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In your few short years as Speaker, you have sought to increase public awareness of Parliament and its work through new methods of communication, such as engaging younger Singaporeans through social media. In doing so, you have encouraged Singaporeans to take an active interest in Parliament as an Organ of State that is fundamental to our democracy.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Mr Speaker, you have done so in step with the changing norms of society and without losing sight of the formality and serious purpose of Parliament as a central pillar in our system of Government.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">When Parliament opened after the President\\'s Address in 2016, I spoke on the tremendous scope available to Parliament and, more specifically, through Select Committees to make our politics more accountable and better accessible to all Singaporeans.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Mr Speaker, I hope you can lend your weight to this and continue to explore ways to demystify the work of Parliament and to better enable Singaporeans appreciate law-making and debates on policy imperatives and trade-offs. Parliament\\'s direct and indirect impact on each and every Singaporean and our businesses is massive; and it is only appropriate that we amplify the choices and the reasons behind the decisions made or not made in Parliament more widely.&nbsp;In doing so, I hope Singaporeans are, in turn, driven to understand the issues we debate deeply but always in the context of a small and multi-racial society which has to balance and accommodate many different viewpoints and shifting norms.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Beyond our shores, I, along with other Parliamentary colleagues, joined you in an official visit to Malaysia in March last year. The courtesy visit to the Malaysian parliament, the Dewan Rakyat, was a highly successful one. I recall the moment our delegation had just taken our seats in the Malaysian parliament\\'s Visitors\\' Gallery when the matter of a Malaysian member of parliament\\'s ejection from their parliament was being fiercely debated and vigorously challenged. I do not think it was a coincidence that another Malaysian member of parliament stood up and invited the Dewan Rakyat to seek your advice from the Visitors\\' Gallery as to whether such a removal of a member of parliament was proper. Though we have not experienced such an episode ourselves in the Singapore Parliament in recent memory, it is clear that your views of how such a matter should be handled are valued in the region.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">You followed up with another visit in the latter part of 2019 with an official trip to the Indonesian People\\'s Consultative Assembly or Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat Republik Indonesia where you invited former Workers\\' Party Secretary-General Mr Low Thia Khiang to join the delegation. Sir, your active interest in engaging parliamentarians of our closest neighbours is something that has not gone unnoticed. Indeed, as this generation of Singaporeans traverses a more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world than before, we would be remiss to ignore our closest neighbours and the context of Singapore\\'s place in our neighbourhood and the wider world.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I am sure the House will continue to look forward to your leadership in such official functions which also include meeting Singaporeans overseas and flying the Singapore flag high.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Sir, on behalf of the Opposition Members of Parliament and Non-Constituency Members of Parliament, we wish you a successful turn as Speaker of this House. We will continue to support your efforts in raising the esteem of our Parliament and our country, both in and out of this Chamber. Congratulations.&nbsp;[<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Saktiandi Supaat.</p><h6>6.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: Mr Speaker, please allow me to speak in Malay.</p><p><em>(In Malay): </em>Mr Speaker, I rise in support of my colleagues in congratulating you on your unanimous re-election as the Speaker of Parliament. You have an even more challenging role to play in this Fourteenth Parliament and we have full confidence that you would be able to guide and help us to contribute to a more robust debate in the House.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Since you were first elected in September 2017, you have enhanced the digitalisation experience in parliament for its members and have shown fairness and impartiality to every member. And, in fact there were moments where you summarised the sitting and even peppered your remarks with wit to lighten an otherwise heated or sombre session.</p><p>&nbsp;In this new Parliament, there may be more supplementary questions, and maybe even interruptions and interjections. Your task will obviously not be an easy one.</p><p>&nbsp;I am, however, certain that you will treat all of us equally and fairly. As we say welcome to new members from both sides of the House, I am confident that the new members can look to you, Mr Speaker, for your forbearance to make their participation less daunting. New members will have a friend in Mr Speaker.</p><p>&nbsp;Please allow me now to say a few things about Mr Speaker’s other qualities. Besides being a savvy social media platform user, you are an accomplished photographer, with a heart to help others, and this is evident in your strong support for charities through your photos.&nbsp;This also means that, when Mr Speaker takes a glance at you, do take note for he may be seeing your points in a different light. As you know photographers use colour filters in tricky lighting conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;Now, we also know lensmen usually possess patience and flexibility. They can keep waiting and sometimes take a hundred snapshots just to get one good photo. But rest assured that we will not test your patience from the Bench. Above all, photographers also have an eye for beauty, creativity and details. Yes, we will stay focused during the sittings and also be appropriately dressed and observe the rules of decorum and etiquette in this House.</p><p>&nbsp;Once again, congratulations on your re-election, Mr Speaker. Thank you.&nbsp;[<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Tin Pei Ling.</p><h6>6.21 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>:&nbsp;(<em>In Mandarin</em>):&nbsp;Mr Speaker, congratulations on your re-election as Speaker of Parliament. Your re-election is what we all hoped for. I believe my colleagues, like me, wish to offer our heartfelt blessings to you.</p><p>Mr Speaker, you are our respected Speaker. Furthermore, you are now the most popular Speaker in our modern history. Named the \"Coolest Singaporean on Twitter\", you not only preside over serious matters in Parliament and serve the residents in your constituency, but also engage actively with netizens on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Your re-election symbolises our expectations for Parliament in the coming years. Parliament is where laws are made. This is also an important forum where we can debate about the present and future of Singapore and Singaporeans. The most pressing task on hand is to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, revive our economy and help Singaporeans resume normal lives. Looking ahead into the post-COVID-19 era, how do we lead Singapore towards another 50 glorious years? It all starts from here.</p><p>In addition, as Parliament is imbued with more diverse and colourful elements, how do we transcend political ideologies and verbal sparring to fight for Singaporeans\\' interests in unison?</p><p>We need a Speaker who is just and compassionate.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I have worked with you for 10 years. From what I have observed, you have three qualities that make you the best candidate for the Speaker\\'s role.</p><p>First, you are compassionate and care for the people around you. You will not neglect anyone, no matter how unimportant or removed they are from you. You constantly keep an open mind and listen to views from all parties to understand their aspirations and challenges, so that policies can be implemented effectively, new laws enacted are fair and balanced, and that the people can benefit. In your constituency, your affable manners and series of people-centric community schemes have won praises and warmed the hearts of many. To you, every resident and every life is precious, each worthy of your attention.</p><p>Second, you have a sense of righteousness. You are a just and fair leader. If you see any unfairness, you will surely step forward. I remember that when you were the Minister for Social and Family Development, you supported the idea that single mothers should enjoy the same maternity benefits so that their young children can be properly cared for. As a mother, this is very important. This is one good example. You are the same in your own constituency. MacPherson can be considered your neighbour. From my years of observation, I am convinced that you are a good leader who treats everyone equally, no matter how insignificant or powerful he is.</p><p>Third, you are humorous but still maintain propriety and can preside over proceedings in this august Chamber. Having served in the army and Cabinet, you are not only equipped with rich experiences but also possess uncommon confidence and composure to deal with any situation. In Parliament, occasional heated debates are inevitable and can be seen as a healthy phenomenon. However, there should not be stalemates in Parliament, especially in the face of the pandemic and economic transformation. We must continue to work for Singaporeans\\' common good and forge ahead. Hence, having a Speaker who can lead and rally all sides in Parliament is all the more important now.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, I look forward to the start of this new term of Parliament and hope that you will pay attention to your health because things are going to get busy again in Parliament.&nbsp;Congratulations once again!&nbsp;[<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p><strong> Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Vikram Nair.</p><h6>6.26 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>: Mr Speaker, in Tamil, please.</p><p><em>(In Tamil): </em>I am happy to speak in support of Mr Tan Chuan-Jin\\'s election as Speaker.</p><p>We both entered politics at the same time in 2011. Since then, Mr Tan has held different responsibilities, including as Minister for Manpower and Minister for Social and Family Development.</p><p>Mr Tan, you are a man with a big heart. You always try to engage people. Even where some may disagree with you, you talk to them. You are active on social media and regularly engage people and share stories about your life and your thoughts on matters.</p><p>As Speaker of the House, you have brought that same spirit here. You have tried to make parliamentary business interesting to members of the public by explaining the rules and their purpose in an interesting way.</p><p>This term of Parliament will see us charting the course through the COVID-19 crisis. It will be important for our people to understand the issues and what is being done to manage the situation. I believe you will play your part to manage the debates fairly and find creative ways to keep the public engaged in the matters in this House.</p><p>Mr Tan, my congratulations once again to you. Thank you. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><h6>6.29 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Hon Members, I would like to thank the Leader of the House Ms Indranee Rajah, for proposing me as Speaker and for her kind words, Mr Sitoh Yih Pin for seconding the nomination. I am also grateful for the kind words of the Leader of the Opposition Mr Pritam Singh and of Mr Saktiandi Supaat, Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Vikram Nair. I would like to express my gratitude to all of you for your support in re-electing me as Speaker. I am fully committed to being fair and impartial but you also do know that I am fully committed to being firm.</p><p>I have no intention of ejecting anyone from this Chamber, so, please help me to help you. As Mr Saktiandi has said, I have also no intention of \"photoshop\"-ing anyone out of the picture.&nbsp;Ms Tin Pei Ling, in her tribute, talked about me caring for those near me and those afar. I suspect she is referring to herself because there were a couple of times in the last session, where she sat in the far corner and did not quite catch my eye, and I did not call her to speak. So, I hear you and I will try to remember that.</p><p>I am also fully committed – and I do need your support for this; many of you participate in this as well – to continue to engage the public. Because it is imperative that we earn their trust, respect and confidence in order for us to be able to do what we do here.&nbsp;</p><p>For the first time, we will be opening Parliament from two locations – here in Parliament House and in The Arts House. As Members know, The Arts House used to be our previous Parliament House. I think there is a special sense of nostalgia for many of the Members, those in The Arts House, to be there in that same Chamber, taking the oath as many of our predecessors did when they pledged to serve Singapore and Singaporeans honourably and faithfully. If I may be candid, I think many of us here would have wished that we were one of those that were designated to be there this evening.&nbsp;</p><p>The Oath of Allegiance is important not because after you take this oath, you become Members of Parliament. In case there is any doubt, you became a Member of Parliament the very night itself when the Returning Officer declared you as victorious in your constituency. The oath is important because, constitutionally, Members of Parliament cannot participate in Parliamentary proceedings until they have taken this oath. Hence, it is important, despite all the challenges that we face because of COVID-19, we need to make sure that we make the arrangements and provisions for all of us to take this oath. And we do so in full accordance with the process because we need to uphold our role in keeping the government of the day accountable to citizens. That is our role in Parliament.</p><p>But accountability also begins with every Member, where we represent the interests of our residents to the best of our abilities. Therefore, we must always keep our eyes and ears close to the ground to understand their concerns. I think all of us need to boldly state our positions, put forth your proposals and seek clarity on matters and issues that matter to your residents. But to be able to do this, we need to participate in Parliamentary proceedings.And to participate in Parliamentary proceedings, you need to be here in the Chamber. So, I look forward to seeing all of you here at every Sitting unless you have official duties or are on urgent leave.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fourteenth Parliament will see 31 newly elected Members of Parliament, the largest number of Opposition Members in recent history and a formally designated Leader of the Opposition. These developments reflect a greater desire by Singaporeans to have more choices and voices in Parliament. We can expect and I think we will expect more contestation. This is a natural step forward. It is good for our country and our people if and only if contestation leads to better outcomes for our people and our nation, for the present and for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>However, do beware that the wide and easy path towards polarisation and division is easy to embark on – the pathway to populism and short-termism. We are all now in a situation where there are no 10-year series answers to fall back on. There will be difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions to be made because there are very real and genuine trade-offs that need to be undertaken.</p><p>Will we focus on solutioning or will we focus on politicking? All of us will determine what these possible outcomes would be. It is important for all of us to remember that regardless of whatever political stripes or colours, wherever we stand on issues, never forget that, as Singapore Parliamentarians, we all serve a common purpose. We have been successful as a people and as a nation on many fronts because we have been exceptional, because we have been different. My challenge to all of you and to all of us here is that, in this House, can we be exceptional because we are able to transcend our political affiliations, our interests and our differences? So that even as we contest passionately and sometimes vigorously, even as we robustly debate and scrutinise laws, policies and Budgets, can we show Singaporeans, can we show the world that we need not be factious, we need not be fractious? Can we earn their trust and confidence as they look upon us as we carry out our business in this Chamber? It is not beyond us – and I look to all of you, and especially to the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition – to help us realise this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In closing, let me echo what the Leader of the House stated. We are opening our Fourteenth Parliament in extraordinary times. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary people and leaders. Let our politics drive us forward and not drive us apart. We are in a raging storm. The countries that are agile, adaptive, determined and, above all, united will be the ones that will be able to ride the waves of recovery. I am confident that we will eventually overcome COVID-19 and emerge stronger.</p><p>So, all hands on deck as we embark on this next lap of our journey together as Parliamentarians. I wish you godspeed, fair winds and following seas as we seek safe harbour from this almighty storm that we find ourselves in and to ready ourselves for the many, many more exciting journeys ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>With that, thank you very much and all the best. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p>I wish to inform hon Members that the President will be present in this Chamber to deliver her speech at the Opening of Parliament later. I, therefore, suspend&nbsp;the Sitting until 8.00 pm. Order. Order.</p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;Sitting accordingly suspended</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-right\"><em>&nbsp;at 6.35 pm until 8.00 pm.</em></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><em>Sitting resumed at 8.00 pm.</em></p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p><strong>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Initiative (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)</strong>: The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) aims to build a Smart Nation where people acquire relevant skills for new jobs in a digital future and our enterprises become more competitive and productive by leveraging on technology. We will drive digital transformation nationwide, build long-term capabilities within Government, and enhance services to the public.</p><p>The COVID-19 crisis has brought to the fore the importance of digitalisation, and the importance of developing deep engineering capabilities to respond effectively.</p><p>GovTech rapidly engineered digital solutions to enable a more effective response to COVID-19. TraceTogether and SafeEntry have helped to make contact tracing faster and more accurate. We have started distribution of TraceTogether tokens to seniors and those who do not own smartphones. The Government also built a suite of digital tools to direct Singaporeans to the relevant delivery points of essential items like masks and tokens. We have adapted to Circuit Breaker and the urgent need to reduce physical contact by accelerating digitalisation: home-based learning and working were widely practised, and more businesses and Government services have shifted online. Our quick response and adaption have been possible because we have been steadily building our digital foundations and capabilities over the past few years.</p><p>COVID-19 presents both a challenge, but also an opportunity to leverage and build on our gains in digitalisation. We must grasp this opportunity and accelerate the transformation of Government, Economy, and Society through technology, to allow us to emerge stronger into a post-COVID-19 world.</p><p>All Government services will be digital from end-to-end by 2023, as committed in the Digital Government Blueprint. Many agencies have already brought forward their timelines in view of COVID-19. This enables all citizens and businesses to transact with us in a paperless, \"presence-less\", and cashless manner, for greater convenience, and at this time, with greater safety.</p><p>We will continue to put users at the centre, and maintain high citizen and business satisfaction with digital Government services, which were at 86% and 78% in 2019 respectively. We rebranded the Moments of Life app as LifeSG. The app now provides a one-stop directory of key Government services grouped by topics and provides recommendations on programmes and events, based on the user’s profile and interests. We will add more features and personalisation in the coming months.</p><p>We will use technology to build Singapore into a Smart City, and to improve quality of life. JTC\\'s Open Digital Platform at Punggol Digital District enables centralised and more efficient district management. The Housing Development Board\\'s (HDB) Smart Hub integrates data to improve estate management and facilitate better town planning. These will be linked to the Smart Nation Sensor Platform to enable even more use cases.</p><p>We continue to strengthen our cyber and data security measures and update our data governance policies. We are implementing the recommendations made by the Public Sector Data Security Review Committee, which will strengthen the Government\\'s data security regime. We will continue to improve on these measures to ensure that data is safeguarded and used securely. For greater transparency, we will also publish and report on past data incidents.</p><p>Amidst a global downturn, we must ensure economic resilience and preserve jobs for Singaporeans. For Singapore to remain competitive and innovative in the post-COVID-19 world, businesses need to accelerate their digital transformation. SNDGG will support the work by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI), Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), and the various sector leads to build a digital economy and create more jobs for Singaporeans. In particular, we will use artificial intelligence (AI) to drive the next phase of Smart Nation, and implement the National AI Strategy.</p><p>We will make it simpler, better and faster for businesses to transact digitally with the Government. With COVID-19, the GoBusiness platform was enhanced to help businesses to stay up-to-date on COVID-19-related regulations and apply for exemptions. GoBusiness also launched an e-Adviser to help businesses better identify relevant government support based on companies’ needs. Going forward, the platform will be expanded to include more services and personalised recommendations.</p><p>To facilitate businesses going digital, the Government is working closely with the industry to build up national digital infrastructure, platforms and standards, that can be used by both the public and private sectors. The National Digital Identity platform will provide a suite of trusted services to help business digitise and transact securely with customers. Our E-Payments infrastructure enables seamless and secure payment. For instance, there are now over 2.4 million individuals registered for PayNow Mobile, 1.7 million for PayNow NRIC and 200,000 companies for PayNow Corporate.</p><p>Our digitalisation efforts will help develop capabilities within the local Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector. The value of Government ICT contracts is projected to increase by over 30% for FY20, to $3.5 billion. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) will be able to participate in up to 80% of procurement opportunities.</p><p>Even as we push ahead with our digital transformation as a nation, every Singaporean must feel that they are a part of and can benefit from Smart Nation. To do so, digital technology must enhance, instead of replace, the human touch.</p><p>COVID-19 has shown that vulnerable groups who are unable to access digital technology are at a greater risk of being left behind. Our digital services, for both public and private sector, need to be accessible and inclusive. The Government will take the lead to strengthen existing, and start new, digital inclusion efforts. These include efforts to translate digital services and websites commonly used by seniors into our official languages. Our digital services are tested for accessibility and meet accessibility standards, and we will constantly incorporate feedback from seniors and persons with disabilities. We will also work closely with MCI’s SG Digital Office to increase outreach to less digitally literate persons and equip them with the necessary hardware and skills.</p><p>We will also continue to support the SG Together movement by engaging Singaporeans to experience, understand and co-create digital technology. We launched \"SmartNation Together\", an online series featuring tech-related talks and workshops, for all age groups. Many of these are conducted by Smart Nation Ambassadors, who are volunteers from all walks of life, united by a passion for tech. Singaporeans will also be able to co-create Smart Nation initiatives. At Smart Nation Co-Creating with Our People Everywhere (SCOPE) sessions, citizens can try out prototypes of upcoming products and share ideas on how to improve our services.</p><p>COVID-19 presents both a need and opportunity to make profound digital transformations and in doing so, emerge stronger as a nation. Within the Government, SNDGG will accelerate the building up of engineering talent and foundations that enable more agile use of IT and data, such as the Government Data Architecture. These have proven to be invaluable in this time of crisis. All ministries are pursuing plans to raise their digital maturity. Across our economy, tripartite partners are working together to raise digital skills, develop digital infrastructure, and enable companies to innovate. This will ensure that digitalisation benefits Singapore and Singaporeans, by transforming how we deliver Government services, grow new economic opportunities, strengthen the core of local talent, and improve the lives of our people.</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>1 <strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Defence (a) what is the projected total cost of producing, packing and distributing the NDP funpacks to each citizen and PR household for NDP 2020; and (b) whether the Government will consider creating an option for those who would like to donate the expense required for their funpack back to the state or to charities.</p><p>2 <strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Defence (a) whether essential and care items can be included in the NDP funpacks to enhance the relevance and usefulness of the funpacks during this challenging period; (b) what items in the NDP funpacks have already been produced for distribution; and (c) what happens to excess items not distributed or when households opt out of the funpacks.&nbsp;</p><p>3 <strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister how will Singapore\\'s National Day commemoration and celebrations differ at the national and local levels in view of the COVID-19 measures.</p><p><strong>\\tThe Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, the first three questions on the Order Paper are related to the National Day Parade. For Question No 3 put by Member of Parliament Ms Denise Phua, I will be answering on behalf of the Prime Minister. Can I seek your consent to take these questions together?</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Yes, please.</p><p><strong>\\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>: In Singapore\\'s relatively short history as a nation, the National Day Parade has always taken centre-stage as we celebrate each year of independence. Members in this House have attended these National Day Parades. And many of you have kindly told me after each parade that it was well done, the mood was lifted, there was a sense of togetherness as Singapore and Singaporeans.</p><p>So, I think, in turn, the National Day Parade has served our nation well&nbsp;– both as a rallying call for all Singaporeans to stay united but also a clear statement of our confidence and determination to succeed collectively, no matter the odds. Through thick and thin, good times or bad, it showed Singaporeans celebrating and standing firm as one people, regardless of race, language or religion. I am so used to the mask that I spoke with it; forgot to take it off! That is what COVID-19 has done to us.&nbsp;</p><p>How did it come about? Not all countries celebrate their national days the way that we have or put the national day parade as centre-stage.</p><p>There is a history to the National Day Parade. The first National Day Parade (NDP) in 1966 was held amid the most testing of times. But that inaugural NDP would set the example for the subsequent 54 years.</p><p>On the morning of 9 August 1966, 500,000 school children assembled in schools and sang the new national anthem, Majulah Singapura, Onward Singapore. That first NDP was held at the Padang with 21-gun salute as the President reviewed various contingents that we have become accustomed to the SAF, the Police, NTUC, uniformed youth organisations and so forth.</p><p>The military units then marched from the Padang into Chinatown, to waving crowds. Fireworks at that time, took place at the Padang and Fort Canning. It followed the Parade and it adorned the skies. At night, there was an illuminated sea dragon, 150 metres long, 12 metres tall, lit up by 12,500 bulbs. It may be prosaic to us today, but at that time, it was quite spectacular. It sailed across what is today\\'s Marina Bay.</p><p>By all accounts, it was an extraordinary event, especially for a nation that was barely a year old. Could Singapore afford it in 1966? Could the money have been put to better use? Remember that our fledgling nation had a host of unsolved problems&nbsp;– high unemployment, few could afford to own homes, high drop-out rates even at Primary 6, inadequate medical care. I am just naming a few.</p><p>Why did the first NDP proceed that way? Because the unity and collective confidence for the future that it engendered among Singaporeans was priceless. It showed to the rest of the world that despite great difficulties, ours was a country that would not be beaten down, ours was a people that will rise and overcome. Without that unity and confidence, Singapore could not have survived, let alone thrived against the challenges that our founding generation faced.&nbsp;</p><p>Member of this House will readily recognise that subsequent National Day Parades take reference from and pay homage to that seminal NDP of 1966&nbsp;– both in spirit and form.</p><p>At each National Day, as we did during the first, we are making a conscious act of the will. It is a willful event that we have said we will celebrate, whether individually or as one people, to celebrate each National Day with the same indomitable spirit, never mind the prevailing difficulties and never mind the differences among people.</p><p>As Singapore prospered over the years, that focus on survival, overcoming difficulties, even unity, may have inadvertently diminished.</p><p>We have had a good run. So, over the years, the NDP has now evolved into softer tones. It has become more individualistic, more of an affirmation of what Singapore is and what being Singaporean means to each citizen. So, you would remember the videos that we played in previous NDPs. They had resonance, Singaporeans liked them because they focused on individuals, differences among our people and yet the unity that we could form from it. That may be today\\'s zeitgeist but we should never forget that the first NDP and the origin of that spirit remains essential for our nationhood.</p><p>When the NDP Executive Committee (Exco) revealed some details for NDP 2020, some Singaporeans felt that these celebrations were wasteful and that the same resources ought to be spent elsewhere, especially in light of the impact that COVID-19 had on our economy and jobs. We have had four Budgets, and each time, we dig into our reserves, to make sure that we protect lives and protect livelihoods and jobs.</p><p>I appreciate that point of view and agree fully with them that we ought to be prudent. The final cost figures are not yet in, but at very least, this year\\'s NDP should be able to reduce the usual budget by a third, with savings from the cost of infrastructure that would have been built if we had held it in the usual way at the Padang or the Float @ Marina Bay.</p><p>I am all for prudence. I think Members of Parliament know me. But we should guard against the mood of despondency overcoming us or allow individual preferences to divide us. If we allow despair to prevail in our national psyche, particularly in this COVID-19 pandemic, then, I say that would be the greatest harm to the future of Singapore&nbsp;– much more devastating than the economic impact, the loss of jobs and businesses.</p><p>Indeed, through every troubled period of Singapore\\'s history – whether it was the British withdrawal in 1971, the recession of 1985, the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998, SARS in 2003, the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, the H1N1 epidemic in 2009&nbsp;– the drumbeat of the National Day Parade that Singaporeans marched to, neither faltered nor reduced in intensity. Even through those difficult years, Singaporeans chose to celebrate the National Day Parade as we have always done, and rallied together.&nbsp;Because of that hope and optimism, Singapore emerged stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>It has been five months since COVID-19 struck our nation. It is, by any account, the most severe disruption globally for at least a century. In fact, experts have to go very far back to find events that matched the equivalent magnitude of the impact. Events like World War I, the Great Depression of the 1920s and 1930s, World War II are cited.&nbsp;</p><p>For tiny Singapore alone, the infections will last many more months. But the impact of disrupted lives and livelihoods will last even longer.&nbsp;</p><p>If at this early stage, Singaporeans lose their mettle, their inner strength and equanimity, lose their resolve, weaken their resilience, sharpen their differences, then, we are already in trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not the Singapore that you and I know. This is not the Singapore spirit that has ensured our survival through many previous hardships. So, I say, despite the difficulties and indeed, because of the more challenging times that are ahead, we should celebrate this year\\'s NDP as we have done before and just as our founding generation did during the first NDP.&nbsp;That, for us, is the most important aspect for this year\\'s NDP.</p><p>The Exco for NDP 2020 has stayed true to its roots, but has adapted the format to reduce the risk of infection in the face of an imminent threat from COVID-19. Their concept, which Ms Denise Phua asked about, is a simple one. Not being able to hold the NDP at a central location with large crowds should not prevent Singaporeans from expressing their pride and love for Singapore and the call for unity.</p><p>NDP 2020 will be celebrated in the safety and comfort of every household in Singapore.&nbsp;We may be physically apart, but we want to join in spirit as one people with that same confidence and optimism and unity that the founding generation fostered despite harsher and grim circumstances.</p><p>Most elements will follow the traditions of past NDPs, but some items will be new. The morning segment will begin with the Prime Minister\\'s National Day message. To remind us of that founding Singapore spirit of that first NDP and to gear Singapore up to face difficulties ahead, it is only right that a parade be held at the Padang. The President will be the Reviewing Officer but for a much smaller scale parade comprising only SAF and Home Team contingents. This will be telecast live. SAF helicopters carrying the Singapore flag will fly over the Padang and also make their way across the housing estates through Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>When the Anthem is played at the Padang, flag-raising ceremonies around the island will take place concurrently, so that Singaporeans across the island, whether in their constituencies, camps, workplaces or elsewhere will be singing Majulah Singapura in unison.</p><p>In past NDPs that Members of this House have enjoyed, the SAF aircraft could fly only over the NDP site, whether at the Padang or the Float. With Changi Airport being one of the busiest in the world, that was all the air space and the air time that we could be allocated for NDP. We expect air travel to pick up in the months ahead and I know that MOT and CAAS are working very hard. But this year, let us turn this into an opportunity so that the SAF aircraft can fly in formation over the heartlands of Singapore, so that Singaporeans can watch it from their homes.</p><p>Mobile columns from the SAF and Home Team will also travel through various parts of the island. With them will be the frontline heroes and heroines who have shown exemplary sacrifice and courage in fighting this COVID-19 pandemic. I know that Singaporeans want to thank them personally. The NDP will be a good occasion from a safe distance for Singaporeans to cheer them on and show them their much deserved appreciation.</p><p>Instead of an NDP show with thousands of participants, there will be a boutique studio show at night, with performances by some local artistes and talents which will be broadcasted live. There will be interactive elements for Singaporeans to sing along, join in the Pledge during the show.&nbsp;</p><p>And as we do each year, there will be fireworks across a few sites in Singapore to cap the day\\'s and night\\'s events over the Singapore skyline, both in the Central Business District and the HDB heartlands. The fireworks will not be as long or spectacular as recent centralised NDPs, but I hope that it will lift the spirits of Singaporeans all across the island.&nbsp;</p><p>To facilitate Singaporeans joining in as one people and one nation, the NDP Exco provides what they call a \"Singapore Together Pack\". Mr Leon Perera and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked about this. The Exco had engaged various groups in designing this pack and has also taken in public feedback. Full details are still being worked out but let me share what I can.</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p><p>Singaporeans will find the bag for the pack useful as a reusable grocery bag; it is practical, foldable into a small pouch. The designs on the bag are by local artists with disabilities and some of our Primary 5 pupils – each design an expression of their feelings for their country and fellow citizens, and their hopes for the future.</p><p>As families will be at home, there is no need for single-use water bottles, neither plastic clappers nor packaging. These have been done away with, to reduce waste. There will be items that express our collective love and wishes for Singapore like the National flag – a full-sized cloth flag, a handheld one – as well as iron-on patches for your masks, a pledge card and face tattoos. Well-wishing corporations have asked to add to the pack items to express their gratitude for what Singapore has given them, by giving back to Singaporeans. The Exco has decided to include hand sanitisers, thermometers, face masks&nbsp;– I think Miss Cheng asked about this&nbsp;– and a snack and drink from a local F&amp;B company. Companies are also offering vouchers and we have decided to put them as an e-discount booklet. Mr Leon Perera asked about cost&nbsp;– the cost of each Singapore Together Pack will be around $2.40.</p><p>For every NDP, the Exco aims to be inclusive and they take in views and accommodate different interests where possible. I think this is good and forward-leaning. But let me just say this as a gentle caution. If every interest group pushes for its own agenda especially during the NDP, then our common ground to celebrate this national event shrinks. Because the Exco simply will never be able to satisfy every request adequately. What the Exco can do this year is to produce fewer Singapore Together Packs, taking into account those who have said that they do not need one. It will therefore produce packs for about 80% of households, which from prior experience should be adequate. All those who want them to celebrate our NDP together can collect them from the CCs.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic will define this generation of Singaporeans, just as the first NDP, those who attended the first NDP, the Merdeka Generation, were defined by the difficulties we had as a newly formed Singapore.</p><p>For this generation, our response will determine whether Singapore continues to thrive in the post COVID world. As with every crisis, people have a choice to make – to overcome or be overwhelmed.</p><p>As we did at the very first NDP, I urge all Members of this House and all Singaporeans to reaffirm our unity, to reaffirm our resilience, bonded by the same vision and optimism that Singapore will prevail and overcome the challenges that this COVID-19 pandemic has brought upon us.&nbsp;The months ahead will be trying and the difficulties ahead will test our resolve and cohesion. Despite all of this, Singaporeans can, and Singapore will, celebrate NDP 2020 with confidence and hope for a brighter future. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Miss Cheng Li Hui.</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p><p><strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines)</strong>: I thank the Minister. I have four supplementary questions.&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that the total number of packs is for 80% of the households. How did the 80% come about? What was the redemption percentage for SG50 packs? Is 80% sufficient to cater to the anticipated demand? What happens to the unredeemed items?</p><p><strong>\\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;Let me thank Miss Cheng Li Hui for her questions. Our past experiences show that 80% will be enough. It is actually less than what we produce usually. We produce usually about 90% of households, sometimes 95%, but we have taken into account those who said they do not need one. I would like to believe that they feel that we are confident enough to celebrate and to join other Singaporeans without all these facilitative things&nbsp;– the flag, tattoos, the iron-on and your masks. We will leave them as they wish and so we will produce 80% which should be adequate.</p><p>The difficulty that the NDP Exco had is trying to shoot a moving target. They started planning this in March. So, when they presented to me the plans, they had a number of scenarios. One scenario was&nbsp;– this was before circuit breaker&nbsp;– the normal NDP, the usual, thousands upon thousands. An interim scenario is where you can have crowds of 50 or even 500. When I saw the plans, I said \"Let us dispense with Options A and B. Don\\'t waste time about it. Let us go to Option C. Let us just assume the worst that COVID-19 will bring\".</p><p>You can come out of the circuit breaker but in August, suppose something happens and we have to reimpose the circuit breaker. The mood will be down, Singaporeans will become despondent and that is the time when we say, \"Come together, have this National Parade even despite your fears, come out and celebrate\" – not come out literally, because you must stay at home; but come out in spirit and celebrate.</p><p>We have had two months off circuit breaker. The psychological effects are there. Some people actually like it; they find working from home more productive and they found a sweet spot. For others, there is actually fear, fear to come out, fear to join others. So, when I read notes that say why do we not be prudent, I completely agree with them. But I want to make sure that this is not despondency or fear.</p><p>If Members of Parliament, judging by the conditions, want to organise events near 9 August for your constituencies and you want us to facilitate with more bags, let me know, and if we can, we will produce more. I promise you this. Because for many heartlanders, these are physical touch points, commonalities, that when they wave the flag, it is the same flag, when they have tattoos, it is a physical token for them to latch on to. Never dismiss&nbsp;these symbols even though the cost is little.</p><p>So, I make this pledge to you. If you hand in your request and you know there are groups that will want it, whether it is various groups, please let MINDEF know and we will try to facilitate for more.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Leon Perera.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the hon Minister for his detailed explanation. I am sure we can all agree that it is important for the country to rally together to have a keynote that underlines our unity during this difficult time.</p><p>I just have two supplementary questions.</p><p>Firstly, when this funpack was announced, I did sense that many Singaporeans felt that at a time when public finances are stretched, and many citizens and micro businesses are facing a lot of difficulty and uncertainty, perhaps the resources to give a pack to every household could be diverted to those who are more in need at this particular time. The Minister has explained the plan with the funpack. But my question is, really, for something like a funpack to serve the purpose that it is intended for, consultation and buy-in from the public may be useful to understand whether most people would really want to have this and&nbsp;whether it would serve that purpose of banishing the despondency, raising the spirits, rallying and unifying everyone. So, learning from this experience, I wonder whether there could be a bigger role for consultation in future before a very large or elaborate logistical exercise, such as distributing packs for everyone, is undertaken. That would be my first question.</p><p>My second question is, I understand that REACH set up an online poll to solicit views of Singaporeans about the funpack. I was wondering how long this poll was up for and what the results of this poll showed, if that is available.</p><p><strong>\\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I am glad that the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) has agreed with me that this is an important time for us to rally together. I agree fully with him that we need to engage groups to see what for them represents a good way to celebrate our National Day Parade. But as I said in my primary answer, while the Exco needs to be open, forward-leaning, consultative, there is a balance. If every group with their individual preferences decide to use the National Day Parade to press for their differences, then I think the Exco has a very difficult task. Because it will never be able to satisfy all groups, it will never be able to be all things to all men. It will have to balance, as we do every year. In previous years, when they, even ourselves, who are conscious about climate change, want to reduce and they press for disposable water bottles, the Exco had to balance the need for elderly and children who need bottled water. The disposable water bottles are actually recyclable the Exco even looked at giving reusable water bottles, then putting water stands, whether it is at the Floating platform or the stadium or Padang, but they found it was undoable. So, they did the next best thing; instead of two small bottles, they gave one big bottle, which will reduce the amount of plastic, I presume.</p><p>It is always these choices to make between different interests. But the more important point is this: for this balance to be struck, how does each individual group want to press for its own interests?&nbsp;We have gone past race, religion and language, I hope&nbsp;– I am talking about the NDP show. But at every NDP show. I am still very careful that there must be proper representation, that even when we carry soft stories that we should represent all of Singapore. But if any interest group decides to say, \"My interests are not shown. What you represent as Singapore does not show my narrower sets of preferences or who I am.\"&nbsp;If they choose to assert those differences during National Day Parade, it is what it is, it is what it will become, but it will shrink our common space.</p><p>I do not know the details of the REACH survey. If Mr Perera wants to know that, he can put it to that Ministry and I am sure that Ministry will give him a full reply.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Ng.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Sir. Let me first thank the Minister for reducing the number of items in the funpack and reaching out to the green groups and listening as well. But could I ask two clarifications?</p><p>One, I do understand we are producing 80% of funpacks for the Singapore households. So, there is already a reduction but that is based, as Minister said, on estimations and based on past experience. Would it not be better to just ask Singaporeans whether they want to opt out of receiving the funpack, so that we can get a more accurate figure that will reduce the wastage?</p><p>The second clarification is what Member Cheng Li Hui asked previously, what will we be doing with the excess funpacks that are not collected?</p><p>Third, let me record my appreciation of thanks to the NDP Exco 2020. I worked with them for the last six months. As what NCMP Leon Perera has asked, we actually have been on the ground for the last six months getting feedback from the green groups and working together with them. In fact, this morning, we had another Zoom call with them to explain why we had a funpack, why we had certain items in there, and it was a very positive conversation that we had. I want to thank the NDP Exco for the forward-thinking, for really listening. It has been a privilege working with the Chairman, Brigadier-General Frederick Choo. In fact, I would suggest that the Minister make him NDP Exco Chairman in 2021 since he did not get to organise a full NDP this year, and he really has done an amazing job trying to find the middle ground and making very difficult decisions.</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p><p><strong>\\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;Let me thank Member Louis Ng for those kind comments. I had known that he had been involved and helped us for the last six months. But I chose not to cite his help in the reply to Mr Leon Perera because, it is better that Mr Ng himself said it. Otherwise, they will say, you know, whatever they will say. I thank Mr Ng for the suggestion that General Choo should be considered to be NDP 2021, in Hokkien, we say, \"Ho Gai Siao\" or a good recommendation. I am not sure if he would want it, but nonetheless, we will think about it.</p><p>Member Mr Ng\\'s point was more substantial. Why not have, before each NDP, a full public consultation as I think was the point that Mr Perera made. Just for practical purposes&nbsp;– Members of this House lead organisations, you are in businesses or in your organisations, you should know – there is a limit beyond which analysis becomes paralysis. You want to have feedback but&nbsp;you have to ultimately make a decision. Because why just a funpack? I cite this but I am not suggesting you make this an issue, but in terms of carbon production, my fighter planes probably produce more. While we \"rah rah\" to the zoom of fighter aircraft, jet fuel is being burnt up there.</p><p>Why focus just on the funpack? It could be many other things.</p><p>So, I think there is a limit to consultation. We will be forward-leaning, we will take in views, but there is a balance to be struck.</p><p>There is a time for every activity, a season for everything under the heavens. That is the ecclesiastical injunction.</p><p>What is this year a time for? Twenty-twenty. What is this year a time for? We have been divided like never before by a little organism, barely 0.125 microns. Relatives have been separated, grandparents from their grandchildren, couples, even spouses. For the healthcare workers, some were so fearful. They were not fearful about going to work but they were so fearful that they would pass on their infections if they got infected to their families, that they chose to stay away from their families, and the hospitals facilitated and found hotel rooms for them to stay alone.</p><p>Never a time have we been so physically divided. Never a time have we been so psychologically affected. And I say this to you not to frighten you, but the months ahead will be harder. This is not a time to show up our divisions. It does not mean we do not ask for feedback. But this is maybe a time, in gentle tones, to put aside some of our differences and come together.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Ng, you have some more clarifications?</p><p><strong>\\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong>: Sorry, Sir, there really is just a remaining concern which is what will we do with the excess packs? I think I understand we might be donating them or giving them to some other groups. But many are asking what are we doing with the excess funpacks that are not collected.</p><p><strong>\\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;I do not know that there will be excess packs. As I said, the mood may change. Let us all hope, maybe come August – given the wonderful job that my colleagues at the Multi-Ministry Task Force have done and Singaporeans taking necessary precautions – that actually come August, there will be a mood to come out of this and people want these packs because they want to join in the celebrations.</p><p>But if they are excess bags, 80% is less than what we have usually produced – there will be no shortage of avenues to distribute to, say, to certain homes or institutions, so they would not be wasted.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Gan Thiam Poh, next question.</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>The following question stood in the name of <strong> Mr Gan Thiam Poh – </strong></p><p>4 To ask&nbsp;the Prime Minister (a) what is the total number of people who have downloaded the TraceTogether app; (b) what is the percentage of each gender for those who have downloaded the app; (c) what are the age groups; and (d) whether the Government will consider further incentives and measures to encourage more subscriptions including from those who are not technically savvy or inclined.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">5 <strong>Mr Vikram Nair</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister whether the download and activation of the TraceTogether app should be made mandatory for everyone in Singapore who possesses a mobile phone.</p><p><strong>\\tMiss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan)</strong>: Question No 4, please.</p><p><strong>\\tThe Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:&nbsp;Let me recap for Members what TraceTogether does. TraceTogether is basically a contact tracing app which uses your phone\\'s Bluetooth function to detect other phones nearby. It keeps a record of other TraceTogether users whom you happen to be in close contact with. It encrypts and stores this data on your own handphone. If, in the unlikely event, you turn out to be positive or diagnosed with COVID-19, this data is then uploaded to MOH, and the contact tracing teams in MOH use this to quickly identify, isolate patients, quarantine people who may be at risk or have been infected by you and can transmit the disease onwards.</p><p>Today, TraceTogether has been downloaded on a voluntary basis by 1.5 million users. The number of downloads, particularly given that it is voluntary, is encouraging. Unfortunately, the app does not appear to work as well on iOS or Apple devices as the iOS operating system suspends Bluetooth scanning when the app is running in the background. We have had repeated discussions both at the technical and policy level with Apple, but we have not yet been able to find a satisfactory solution.&nbsp;</p><p>Because TraceTogether does not work equally well across all smart phones, we have decided, therefore, at this point in time, not to mandate the compulsory use of TraceTogether. Instead, we are developing and will soon roll out a portable wearable device that will achieve the same objective as TraceTogether, but will not depend on possession of a smart phone. If this portable device works, we may then distribute it to everyone in Singapore. I believe this will be more inclusive and it will ensure that all of us will be protected.&nbsp;</p><p>Notwithstanding the limitations of coverage today, the data from TraceTogether has already been a very helpful additional tool for our contact tracers, especially when it is used in combination with other data sources. In some cases, it has improved the contact tracing process by automatically generating a preliminary list of close contacts for quarantine, and thereby it reduces the time taken to isolate these contacts and prevents them from spreading the disease more extensively.</p><p>I would like to emphasise that contact tracing remains a professional skill that is ultimately dependent on human judgement. Technology is an enabler; it is not a replacement for human judgement.</p><p>We thank those who have voluntarily downloaded the app to date and we urge more to download the app. We have also just upgraded the app to register the NRIC or FIN of the user, in addition to the user\\'s mobile number, so that we can more quickly establish the link between the identity of the confirmed cases and their close contacts.</p><p>To Mr Gan Thiam Poh\\'s question, we do not, at this point in time, have the breakdown of the downloads by gender or age, because such data is not currently collected by the app.</p><p>Yesterday, we issued a written response to Mr Murali Pillai who had asked about the confidentiality of the data, and I think it is worth me reiterating that again, that the data is stored only on your own phone in the first instance and accessed by MOH only if the individual tests positive for COVID-19. This data is only used for contact tracing. There are safeguards, including encryption, in place to protect this from malicious hackers. The data that is older than 25 days will be automatically deleted from your phone. If the close contact data is required for contact tracing,&nbsp;only a small group of authorised officers in MOH will have access to it. All the public sector data protection rules will also apply.&nbsp;</p><p>I need to emphasise again that quick and accurate contact tracing is a necessity. In fact, it has become all the more essential now that we are&nbsp;emerging from the circuit breaker. Because if you think about it, if everyone is at home, in fact, the need for contact tracing is minimal. But now that we have more people moving about, going to work, there will be more occasions when more people will have more close interactions with each other. Therefore, the collection and use of this data for contact tracing becomes even more essential. It will speed up the isolation of close contacts and reduce the risk of them spreading COVID-19 to their loved ones, family members, friends, colleagues and the community at large.</p><p>If we can reduce the incidence of clusters by better and faster contact tracing,&nbsp;then we can avoid having to re-introduce restrictive circuit breaker measures in the future. So, I hope all members of the public will work with us to achieve this.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Minister, can I take it that you are answering Question Nos 4 and 5?</p><p><strong>\\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>: Yes, with your consent, please.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>The following question stood in the name of <strong> Miss Cheng Li Hui – </strong></p><p>6 To ask&nbsp;the Minister for Education (a) whether there are coordinated efforts between the career centres of Institutes of Higher Learnings and agencies such as Enterprise Singapore to connect graduates with enterprises to provide employment opportunities; (b) how can graduates be further supported in their endeavour to secure employment and also further their academic pursuits and retraining to better equip them for the post COVID economy; and (c) how can internship opportunities play a role for graduates during this challenging period.</p><p><strong>\\tThe Minister for Education (Mr Ong Ye Kung)</strong>: Fresh graduates are entering the job market at an exceptional time. Many will face challenges in securing a job. The Institutes of Higher Learning or IHLs, together with various Government agencies, will provide whatever support we can to all graduates entering the workforce.&nbsp;</p><p>First, they will give graduates peace of mind during their job search, so MOE has suspended the repayment and interest for all study loans, for one year.</p><p>Second, the IHLs, namely the Autonomous Universities, Polytechnics and ITE – each have a significant network of companies and employers.&nbsp;They have been leveraging them to provide internships and Work-Study programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>Employers in general are facing difficulties due to COVID-19.&nbsp;But many are still prepared to hire and others who do not have job vacancies may be prepared to offer traineeships.&nbsp;IHLs are committed to trying their best to help our graduating students.&nbsp;They will contribute to the pool of about 100,000 opportunities under the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package that the National Jobs Council is overseeing and building up.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure that graduates have access to these jobs and opportunities, the IHL Career Centres will continue to provide career guidance and assistance, labour market information and organise career fairs. The Career Centres have stepped up the intensity of their efforts this year, including using online outreach and counselling tools to support graduates remotely.</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">For graduates who decide to delay their entry into the job market, the IHLs will support them to learn new skills and knowledge.&nbsp;IHLs will offer their graduates a few Continuing Education and Training (CET) modules free of charge and we are in the process of speaking to the IHLs, structuring all these modules into a continuous programme and with credentials at the end of it. In that way, graduates can take up this programme and delay their entry into the labour market while doing something very meaningful. Graduates can also enrol for further studies, including Advance Diplomas, Specialist Diplomas and graduate certification programmes.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Member also asked about internships.&nbsp;This has become a challenge as many internships have been disrupted due to COVID-19 and our circuit breaker measures to curb community spread. IHLs are working hard to identify alternatives so as to mitigate any impact on learning outcomes and graduation timings.&nbsp;If rescheduling the internship is not possible, IHLs will offer substitutes, such as working on industry-related projects and taking additional modules.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">COVID-19 will be a defining moment in our graduates’ lives, especially this batch of graduates. I urge our graduates to rise to the occasion and use this crisis to bring out the best of their generation. The Government will support them as closely as possible as they enter the next phase of their life’s journey.</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>7 <strong>Assoc Prof Walter Theseira</strong> asked&nbsp;the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) what has been the framework for Government\\'s procurement of goods and services to address the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) what proportion of such contracts, by dollar value, have been issued through the standard Government procurement system on GeBIZ; (c) what are the considerations when issuing contracts otherwise; and (d) what steps are taken to ensure that all enterprises can participate in such procurement opportunities so as to ensure provision at competitive prices and quality.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tThe Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, t<span style=\"color: black;\">he Government procurement framework calls for open sourcing through the GeBIZ platform as the default approach. However, the use of limited tenders or direct contracting is permitted under specific conditions, such as to protect public health, or for reasons of national security. These practices are aligned with international standards laid out in the World Trade Organisation’s Agreement on Government Procurement.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">To address the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation and avoid further worsening of the public health situation, Government agencies had to obtain necessary goods and services as quickly as possible. While the default approach continues to be open sourcing via GeBIZ, the urgency meant that, in some cases, it was not practical to do so. For such instances, the procedures under Emergency Procurement allow Government agencies to directly contract with suppliers who have the necessary expertise and resources, instead of going through open sourcing. For example, as we needed to quickly source for and fit out premises to house at-risk persons, and also secure essential medical supplies, the agencies concerned established direct contracts with the suppliers outside GeBIZ who were best able to meet the requirements within the shortest timeframe possible. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Similar Emergency Procurement practices are also adopted in other jurisdictions. For example, in Australia, the European Union, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, government agencies may directly award a contract without the need for open competition under emergency situations, such as the COVID-19 crisis. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The proportion of COVID-19 related procurement by dollar value through GeBIZ as compared with other modes is not yet available, as such procurement is still on-going. Agencies will continue to use the most appropriate approach that best balances urgency of need and value-for-money in our efforts to protect public health and cater for the social and economic needs of Singaporeans and businesses. As the situation improves and there is less time urgency, a larger proportion of procurement will be carried out through the default process of open sourcing via GeBIZ. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Regardless of the procurement approach taken, Government agencies are required to ensure proper evaluation is done and necessary approvals are sought. In the event that direct contracting is used, Government agencies are still expected to assess that the quotes from the suppliers are reasonable, by comparing against prevailing market benchmarks and taking into account the time constraints and world-wide market situation. As with all procurements, transactions done during this period are subject to audit and compliance reviews by relevant authorities.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>\\tAssoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Second Minister for the reply. I think we all know, one advantage of having procurement in GeBIZ is that it is automatically transparent. And this is very important to parties in the market because they can get some information about what is available and what market prices might even be and so on. Will the Government be able to commit to publishing at least some summary information of what has been done and what has been issued for Government procurement relating to COVID-19 needs some time soon so that players in the market can update themselves and understand better how they can best respond and provide more competitive services and goods to the Government in this crisis?</p><p><strong>\\tMs Indranee Rajah</strong>: I thank the Member for his clarification. The truth of the matter is that if we all knew exactly when the virus decides to stop and when COVID-19 will stop, then we will be able to give a specific timeline on all the things we wish to do. But as we know, there is a possibility of second outbreaks, there is a possibility that it may not go the course we wish, in which event, Emergency Procurement will have to continue to take place.</p><p>So, the assurance that I can give is that best practices will be followed. As I have said earlier, we will make sure that the agencies still take proper evaluations and that they seek the necessary approvals, that they compare against the prevailing market benchmarks. And it is important to remember that all this is still subject to audit and compliance reviews. So, the framework for disclosure that we have in place will be complied with in due course. But if the question is whether we can do this very soon, the answer is I am afraid that the nature of this virus and the situation are such that it is not possible to say definitively one way or another.</p>',\n",

There is a range of debt instruments, including bonds and loans, with different structures, such as a mezzanine or preferred instrument, depending on the capital structure of the investee company.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">GIC and Temasek can and do provide loans, where the loans are provided in the investment context. However, they do not provide the same loans as banks or finance companies do, that is to say, they do not provide mortgage loans or working capital loans which banks provide.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The Government does not direct GIC’s and Temasek’s individual investment decisions, including decisions as to whether, when or in whom to invest in a loan. The President’s concurrence is not needed for investment decisions by GIC or Temasek. Instead, the Government holds the Boards of GIC and Temasek accountable for their overall performance. The Government ensures that GIC and Temasek have competent Boards, and such appointments are subject to the President’s concurrence.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Leon Perera.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I have just one supplementary question. This question is in the context of our sovereign wealth funds when they provide a rescue package, be it through loans or other instruments, to help to support the viability of some companies but not others. That sometimes creates a question among some members of the public and they ask how are these decisions made that certain companies obtain this kind of support and other companies do not.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">So, as a general principle, given that these are public funds, is there any way that the public can have some transparency about the thinking behind these probably quite significant decisions which may continue to happen as this crisis winds its way forward?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tMs Indranee Rajah</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. The way the Member has phrased the question, which is when they provide a rescue package to support viability, that is a wrong assumption. The parameters are, as I have laid out before, GIC and Temasek primarily invest, and they invest our Reserves, and their mandate is to act within their investment policies to get the returns that they can, that we are then able to use in various ways, as we have seen.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">So, they operate in the context of investment. They do not do business the way banks do, or other kinds of entities who may look to do rescuing just in the context of rescuing. As I have explained before, they do it in the investment context, and that is very well known. The framework within which they operate is well known. The commercial principles&nbsp;– and these are all commercial decisions – these are decisions that are taken by their professionals which are employed by GIC and Temasek. So, there is actually no difference with what they actually do, or loans made in the investment context.&nbsp;</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>9 <strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for National Development (a) whether a tender was waived for the construction of all Government Quarantine Facilities (GQF), Community Recovery Facilities (CRF) and Community Care Facilities (CCF); (b) if so, whether this was due to time constraint or other reasons; (c) whether all such construction works were planned to be cost recovery or below cost engagements; (d) what price reasonableness test was applied; (e) whether attempts were made to explore whether other event and exhibition construction firms were able and keen to undertake the engagement; and (f) whether further requisitions of GQFs, CRFs and CCFs are necessary and whether the engagements will be done on a cost recovery or below cost basis.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tThe Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government has responded swiftly to put in place a range of facilities to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. For Government Quarantine Facilities (GQFs) as well as dedicated facilities for Stay-Home Notice (SHN) requirements, we have made use of the capacity in existing Government chalets and hotels. In the case of hotels, we benchmarked the quotes provided by the hotel operators and negotiated for competitive rates, taking into account the prevailing market conditions.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">For Community Care Facilities (CCFs) and Community Recovery Facilities (CRFs), apart from using ready live-in accommodation like army camps and students’ residences, we also had to prepare new facilities in a very short time. We, therefore, moved quickly to fit out the Changi Exhibition Centre, the Singapore Expo, Big Box, the former ITE site at Ang Mo Kio, vacant factories and Tanjong Pagar terminal with beds and partitions and, in some cases, tentages, to quickly house the patients. And we now know from experience that I think we did all these not a moment too soon because we were able to get the capacity in place to look after quite a large number of infected patients without overwhelming our healthcare system.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The contracting of hotels and the construction of fit-out works were undertaken under Emergency Procurement, as my colleague Second Minister Indranee has highlighted earlier. This is provided for under the Government Procurement Rules, where urgent purchases have to be made in a pandemic outbreak and there is insufficient time to follow the normal procurement rules.&nbsp;The Emergency Procurement procedure allows for tenders to be waived and for contracts to be directly awarded to vendors with the necessary experience, expertise and resources to get the job done within a short period of time.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Notwithstanding the waiver of tender under such Emergency Procurement, all the agencies recognise the need for accountability in the use of public funds.&nbsp;All decisions for the setting up of CCFs and CRFs are, therefore, approved by the Multi Ministry Taskforce. The agencies will ensure that the quotes from the commercial partners are reasonable by comparing against market benchmarks, they will scrutinise the invoices and ensure that the works meet the standards required by the Government before processing the payments. In some cases, we have been able to get private sector companies to support the projects on a cost-recovery basis as part of their contributions to the community.</p><p>The Government will continue to partner different stakeholders, including private sector companies, to ensure an effective whole-of-society response to COVID-19, while maintaining a prudent and disciplined approach in the use of public funds.</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Pritam Singh.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: I thank the Minister for his reply and also the reply from Second Minister for Finance earlier on to Assoc Prof Walter Theseira\\'s question. They were quite helpful for members of the public to understand what emergency procurement is about, including the&nbsp;answer given by the Second Minister for Finance on audit, which explained that it is not as if audit has been done away with.</p><p>My question is on non-emergency procurement, going forward, with regard to perhaps quarantine facilities, stay-at-home facilities, whether the Task Force – as alluded to by the Second Minister for Finance – is considering more open tender processes, so Singaporean companies, other companies can participate, in light of the economic situation.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, as I had explained earlier, we had to rely on emergency procurement given the nature of the pandemic, given the time urgency that we were at and the need to activate our facilities very quickly.</p><p>Certainly, looking forward, if the situation were to stabilise and the conditions permit, agencies will consider going beyond emergency procurement to get more quotes or even to go through contracting via GeBIZ. And this would apply not just for the setting up of facilities, but for a whole range of contracting requirements that the Task Force require. But I think first and foremost, let us focus on the mission and the mission is not over, the fight is still on. So, we will do whatever is necessary to get the job done and to deal with the virus.</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Walter Theseira.</p><p><strong>\\tAssoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Just to follow up on the questions which have been raised. I think the public understands completely that during emergency procurement, there is a need to get these goods and services delivered quickly by trusted suppliers. But given that the emergency procurement rules or situation may continue for quite some time, what can the Government do to try to broaden the number of vendors out there who could be eligible for providing goods and services under the emergency procurement rules?</p><p>For example, will it be possible to take a bit of time for the agencies to look at the landscape, the firms out there and to review the list of companies on this emergency procurement list? I think that would be very important to not only give us a good price and quality of goods and services, but also to assure enterprises that they will be able to help out and participate, and also, help their bottom line out a bit.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Member for the question which is related to what Mr Singh had asked earlier too. I would say that even under the scenario of emergency procurement today, agencies do not immediately go with one vendor. So, the various agencies that are looking at all sorts of contracting procurement requirements do already today engage a few vendors – whether it is for are M&amp;E works,&nbsp;whether it is for consultancy services and then they get the quotes. Even though it is not required under emergency procurement, they could have gone directly. They have already done that. They check the different quotations and then they go with a supplier. So, a range of different suppliers are already being used under today\\'s scenario and that situation will continue.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Walter, next question.&nbsp;</p>',\n",

These Nature Ways use multi-tiered planting of native trees, shrubs and ground cover to replicate the natural structures of forests. They make paths cooler and more comfortable for users, and facilitate the movement of birds and butterflies between green spaces. These measures have benefited the environment and biodiversity, and reduced the frequency of greenery maintenance needed.&nbsp;NParks will continue to identify more sites to be curated and managed as naturalistic landscapes, and implement more Nature Ways.</p><p>But even in such settings, there will still be a need for regular maintenance, especially for public health and safety reasons.&nbsp;For example, tall grass may conceal discarded litter, making dengue control operations more difficult. They also pose a fire risk during prolonged periods of dry weather.&nbsp;Hence, NParks will gradually scale up maintenance along green verges as the circuit reaker measures are eased.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>NParks will also continue to encourage productivity in the greenery maintenance sector. Such work is increasingly being mechanised and innovative technologies are being applied to reduce the need for manual labour.</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>11 <strong>Mr Saktiandi Supaat</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the total number of business closures and formations since the start of the circuit breaker period; (b) what is the sectoral breakdown of those most affected to the least affected; (c) what is the Ministry\\'s outlook on the business cessation trend and sectoral implications for the remainder of 2020 even as the global and domestic economies gradually open up.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tThe Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in April 2020, around 3,800 business entities were formed.&nbsp;Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this was almost a third lower than the average of 5,500 recorded over the same period between 2015 and 2019. Most sectors saw a fall in the formation of new business entities during this period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The cessation of business entities numbered around 3,800 in April, which was comparable to the average of 3,700 recorded over the same month in the past five years.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">For the rest of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a severe impact on many sectors of our economy. Outward-oriented sectors such as wholesale trade will be adversely affected by the global economic slowdown, while the air transport and tourism sectors will continue to be badly affected by travel restrictions. Sectors such as retail and food services will also be adversely impacted by reduced demand from tourists and local consumers. On the other hand, there are sectors which continue to grow, such as biomedical manufacturing and the information and communications sector.&nbsp;</p><p>Against this backdrop, MTI expects the formation of new business entities to remain subdued, while cessation numbers could see an uptick in the coming months.</p><p>Sir, it is not possible to avoid firm closure and retrenchments. These happened even before COVID-19, but with COVID-19, we must expect the situation to worsen and these numbers to go up. We will help every worker. Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam is chairing the National Jobs Council. The council aims to support close to 100,000 jobseekers through the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. This includes initiatives to expand job opportunities in both the public and private sectors, provide a range of traineeships for jobseekers to gain industry-relevant experience and build professional networks, as well as increase training capacity to enable jobseekers to upgrade their skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is a very challenging task. There is no certainty that we will succeed in creating all the jobs and opportunities in adifficult economic environment. But we will do our best. We will rally together. We will bring on board all tripartite partners. We will support one another and spare no effort to achieve our goals. And we will overcome this crisis as one united Team Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\\tMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: I would like to thank Senior Minister of State Chee for the detailed answer. I just have one supplementary question. In relation to his answer, with MTI and EDB\\'s announcement that from January to April, there is an investment commitment of about $13 billion coming to Singapore. In terms of job creation, going forward, and also those investment commitments beyond April to end of 2020 and possibly early first half of 2021, can Senior Minister of State share a bit more about whether the trajectory of investment commitments will continue to be positive and in which sectors in particular, going forward?</p><p><strong>\\tMr Chee Hong Tat</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I thank Mr Saktiandi for his supplementary question. Minister Chan Chun Sing shared earlier this week that the investment commitments that EDB has managed to attract amounted to $13 billion and this will create thousands of jobs. We are heartened that investors continue to have confidence in Singapore and that is very important because we do need to create jobs&nbsp;from a range of different sources – public sector, but also private sector.</p><p>As to how well we can continue to attract investments, I think a key factor is how well we respond to this crisis as a country. If we can demonstrate resilience, fortitude, we can show unity, we are able to overcome this crisis together as one united Team Singapore, we are able to rally our tripartite partners to work closely together, I think we can inspire confidence and we can attract investments. We can demonstrate that Singapore has the capabilities and the resilience to overcome this crisis. That is very important – how we respond to this crisis together.</p><p>We continue to have to remain as an attractive business hub because it is not just about retaining our current capabilities and companies but also attracting new ones. I shared earlier in my main reply that there will be some sectors that will show a decline and some sectors will show growth. How we navigate in this new COVID-19 environment, how we are able to adapt, how quickly and how flexible we can be to adjust to attract new growth sectors – agri-tech, biomedical, e-commerce, financial sector, infocomm and technology – those are the areas which we have to work together to be able to grow the pie so that there is more to go around; better jobs, more jobs, more opportunities.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Next, question.

       "   'content': '<p>The following question stood in the name of <strong> Mr Seah Kian Peng – </strong></p><p>12 To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the assessment of industries in the post COVID-19 era, specifically which are those that the business community and workforce should pivot to and position themselves going forward.&nbsp;</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>\\tMs Tin Pei Ling (MacPherson)</strong>: Question No 12, please.</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, COVID-19 is an unprecedented crisis with impact extending far beyond that of public health. It will change the global economy and social norms in far more significant ways than past crises. We will likely remain in a COVID-19 environment for some time; and even when the pandemic recedes, life would not return to what it used to be.</p><p>Trade flows will be affected by the reconfiguration of supply chains. Some countries will respond by home-shoring certain production, while others will strengthen their inter-dependence with other economies and diversify their supply chains. How people travel will also change in ways more significant than after 9/11. Companies will need to transform their business models and operations. Manufacturers will have to redesign their \"just-in-time\" production to balance between achieving efficiency and resilience. The pace of digitalisation will accelerate and play a more fundamental role in the way we work, live and play.&nbsp;</p><p>As a small and open economy, Singapore’s response cannot be to turn inward. We need to find our new relevance to the world. Even as we cope with the immediate challenges, there will be new opportunities where we can seize, we can leverage on our strengths and we can ride on the key shifts brought about by the pandemic. While some of these developments are still playing out, and there is still some uncertainty in terms of how the new landscape will look like, there are a few areas our businesses and workers should start to re-position ourselves for.</p><p>First, changing consumption preferences, coupled with a rising middle class in Asia, will drive new demand. While the pandemic is still evolving, some changes, including those that started even before COVID-19, have become evident, such as a renewed emphasis on health and an increased focus on sustainability. If this continues, it will benefit industries such as healthcare, online retail and financial services – just to name a few. We will have the opportunity to enhance our value proposition in these areas to capture the growth in demand.&nbsp;</p><p>As Asia continues to grow, we must also work together with our neighbours to capture new opportunities. For example, in the agri-food industry, we are building up our local food production capabilities and also working with neighbouring countries such as Brunei, to grow this as an exportable sector that can strengthen food security and create good jobs for our peoples.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, global supply chains will be reconfigured as businesses seek to balance efficiency and resilience. This started before COVID-19, and we can expect the pace to accelerate. As companies shift their production lines, our manufacturing and logistics industries should position themselves to serve new demand and participate in new supply chains that are formed. We must continue to compete on our strengths such as trust, quality and connectivity. These have become even more important to investors and customers in the new environment. This is where our biomedical and precision engineering industries can play to our advantage by leveraging sophisticated technologies and the trust and quality that have been associated with Singapore. Our trusted brand name is an asset in this environment. If we can move fast to capture the opportunities created by these shifts, Singapore will be in a stronger position when recovery comes.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, the digital economy will take on greater salience than before and we must be prepared to seize the opportunities it brings. The pandemic has compelled businesses in all industries to turn to technology-enabled platforms for safe operations and business continuity. Besides shoring up a strong demand for digital solutions in the ICT sector, the quickened pace of technology adoption across industries has also transformed business models – especially for traditionally brick-and-mortar industries such as retail and food services – and it has enabled these businesses to access wider markets and consumer segments than before. For essential services such as healthcare, the rise of tele-medicine also provides an opportunity for the industry to redefine service quality and access markets beyond Singapore. Businesses will need to pivot towards the digital economy, and the Government will continue to extend strong support to help our enterprises to transform their business models and to train our workers in new skills to prepare them for this digital economy.</p><p>Sir, as a country, Singapore has time and again reinvented ourselves to be relevant to the world. We can recover from this crisis and we will grow again. Global competition will be intense. The road ahead will not be easy, but we will walk this journey together.</p><p>The key is to remain united and support one another to transform ourselves to seize new opportunities. We need to strengthen Singapore’s attractiveness as a hub for business and investments and remain open to global trade and talent to benefit from Asia’s growth. How well we recover will depend on our adaptability as a country, as businesses and also as individuals.</p><p>We start from solid foundations – a trusted brand name and rule of law, a cohesive and hardworking people, a strong tripartite partnership and excellent connectivity with the rest of the world. With these strong fundamentals, I am confident that Singapore will survive the crisis and we can emerge stronger.</p>',\n",

Therefore, MCI and IMDA are working&nbsp;with our telecom operators to enhance our telecom infrastructure. This includes further increasing network buffers to keep pace with future demands and investing early in 5G networks.</p><p>Today, telecom operators, as part of network and service resilience requirements, must provide adequate redundancy, back-ups and diversity arrangements within their networks.&nbsp;But outages still occur even with robust measures in place. IMDA takes a very serious view of such network disruptions and is investigating the causes of the outages by StarHub, M1 and MyRepublic.&nbsp;Where necessary, IMDA will take enforcement action against any operator found liable for causing an outage or failing to restore services quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, we are studying alternative means to enhance back-ups in our networks so that consumers can continue to have connectivity during outages; as well as how telecom operators can enhance their capabilities to quickly identify and rectify the causes of disruption.&nbsp;These will be essential to the overall resilience of our digital infrastructure, and quality of service rendered to customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We aim to enhance our digital infrastructure in a sustainable manner that takes into consideration the energy and carbon footprint generated.

Indeed, the SACs may resume on-site activities gradually in Phase One. Before resuming on-site activities, SACs are required to undergo a readiness assessment and propose plans on infection prevention and control, and safe distancing measures. The Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) will also conduct spot checks to ensure that these measures are implemented.

If we do not have sufficient reserves, the $33 billion Fortitude Budget would not be possible. We have to thank the previous Governments for saving for a rainy day, progressively setting aside budget surpluses for our reserves. Because of this, we are able to come up with four Budgets totaling $93 billion to assist Singaporeans, save companies, save jobs and save lives.</p><p>The circuit breaker has just ended and every company hopes to resume operations as soon as possible. Every employer is eager for his or her employees to resume work. Every Singaporean hopes to resume their lifestyles like before, visiting their parents, shopping, and going to the park. Currently, there is no cure nor vaccine for COVID-19, so we cannot do away with the preventive measures. So then how can we deal with the new normal in the post-circuit breaker period? Will COVID-19 continue to spread in the community? What is the level of risk?&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps, the testing of 39,000 pre-school staff can offer some clues. Currently, 14 pre-school staff have been diagnosed with COVID-19, which translates to an infection rate of 0.036%. Among the 14, 13 had contracted the virus previously and were no longer infectious at the point when they were confirmed as positive cases. In other words, these 13 pre-school staff were not aware that they had been infected prior to testing. Before they recovered, they could have passed the virus to others and spread it to the community while they were out and about. Fortunately, they had gone out less during the circuit breaker period and have minimised the risk of infecting others.&nbsp;</p><p>If we apply the testing and confirmed case numbers of the pre-school staff to the 2.4 million working citizens and Permanent Residents in Singapore, then the infection rate of 0.03% would mean that there may be 861 local residents who have been infected but are unaware about it. More importantly, among the 39,000 pre-school staff, one individual was infected recently. From the infection of pre-school staff, it is not difficult to understand why zero community infection could not be maintained in the past few weeks.</p><p>Moving forward, as we embark on the first phase of the post-circuit period, more people will leave home to work and the risk of community infection will definitely increase. I know that many SMEs would like to resume operations but I would urge everyone to be more patient.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, our community infection rate has been relatively low. The death rate has also remained low. There are only five patients in ICU currently. Experts say that in the next one and a half years, it is not possible to eradicate COVID-19 totally from the community. Therefore, Singaporeans must remain vigilant, wash their hands frequently, wear a mask and maintain the one metre safe distance. Safe management measures at workplaces will become the new normal. If people are infected, they should be quarantined immediately, and proactive contact tracing must be conducted.&nbsp;</p><p>If people are able to accept this new normal and understand that COVID-19 will not disappear in a few months like SARS, I hope MTF will allow all industries to resume operations as soon as possible. This will boost consumption and save jobs. Otherwise, no matter how much support and grants are given, so long as companies cannot operate, there will still be retrenchments and insolvencies.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that the Government will be flexible in this aspect. I am the advisor of the Renovation Contractors’ Associations. The Chairman of the Association, its key members and myself have held meetings with BCA several times to pave the way for resuming work. Many families’ renovation projects had to stop because of the circuit breaker measures, and they cannot wait for the project to start again.&nbsp;However, the requirements for resumption of renovation projects have been very stringent. Through several rounds of consultations, BCA has simplified the procedures and allowed several thousand renovation projects to resume on 2 June. I would like to thank BCA for their help.</p><p>COVID-19 has disrupted industries and sped up the pace of digital transformation. However, at markets and hawker centres, most stallholders accept cash only. After NETs was set up in 1985, Singapore soon became the leader for e-payments in Asia. However, after so many years, we have lagged behind other Asian countries in terms of e-payments. Therefore, I am happy to see the establishment of the Digital Transformation Office and that every hawker will be given a $300 monthly bonus for the next five years to encourage them to adopt cashless payments. There are also plans to recruit 1,000 digital ambassadors to help the elderly Singaporeans learn digital skills.</p><p>Last year, when organising the River Hongbao activities, we worked with NETS to encourage the food stallholders to adopt cashless payments. However, the results were lacklustre. When I visited markets, hawker centres and coffeeshops, I also received feedback on cashless payments from stallholders. Some were positive; some were negative. Therefore, I would like to make a few suggestions so that we can improve the e-payment adoption rate and the efficiency of digital ambassadors.</p><p>Some stallholders are worried about the cash flow problem, so they hope that they will be able to get the e-payments by customers several hours after the payments were made.&nbsp;</p><p>Stallholders currently pay cash to suppliers for materials. If this segment of the supply chain can be digitised, more stallholders may be encouraged to adopt e-payment.&nbsp;</p><p>There are currently 19 e-payment platforms in Singapore. I understand that the intention of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is to allow different e-payment platforms to thrive. However, this may lead to confusion and it may distract customers. I suggest that IMDA focus on one or two platforms such as PayNow and NETS. This will make e-payment easier for Singaporeans, especially the elderly.</p><p>According to a report by Lianhe Zaobao, most of the digital ambassadors recruited will be graduates from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL). These fresh graduates are familiar with technology, but they may not empathise with the fear and resistance of stallholders against e-payments. I hope that the Government will focus more on recruiting Singaporeans who may have initial reservations about technology but have learnt to use e-payment eventually. Then, they can effectively encourage stallholders to embark on digital transformation.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chinese say that food is the most important of all things. Only when everyone can use e-payment to buy food, can we say that our digital transformation is truly taking shape. I hope that from now onwards, stallholders who used to count cash will use the QR code as the norm.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, resilience is forged through crisis.&nbsp;With this fourth Budget, the Government has already pumped in $93 billion to help Singaporeans and the economy.&nbsp;While COVID-19 has created havoc, it is clear that COVID-19 has also brought out the best in us, not just in putting the community above self-interest and abiding by the circuit breaker rules, but also in how some of us are extending a helping hand to others. There are countless examples, like those who have volunteered to help out in the frontline at the migrant worker dormitories, or those who have signed up with different charities via Giving.sg&nbsp;to donate money, essential items or volunteer their time.</p><p>There are also many inspiring stories in Jurong West, helping others during this difficult time.</p><p>One of our residents, Joyce Yu, did not throw up her hands in defeat when her parent\\'s nasi lemak hawker stall suffered from a plunge in business due to COVID-19 and the circuit breaker measures. Instead, she managed to raise funds from her friends so that her parents could provide nasi lemak as free breakfast for needy families in Jurong.</p><p>As her parents also had hawker friends who were in the same situation, she slowly expanded the scheme. Today, she has raised about $20,000, not just from her friends, but also through the Giving.sg website and the Loving Hearts Multi-Service Centre in Jurong.&nbsp;These funds help to pay about nine workers, including her parents, to provide about 150 free breakfasts to families in Jurong every day. Grassroots volunteers also chipped in by distributing the food free of charge.</p><p>Joyce has a full-time job with YMCA but she is happy to liaise with the hawkers and raise funds. She says she wanted to come up with a scheme which is a win-win solution to support local businesses, hawkers like her mother\\'s, while feeding vulnerable people.</p><p>Joyce is not alone. There are many similar stories like hers.&nbsp;We want to encourage more.&nbsp;We want to collect all these good deeds and inspire more to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This year National Day will not have the glitter and pageantry of the huge parades like what we have had over the last 54 years. This year\\'s National Day is our nation\\'s 55th birthday. We want to celebrate the unsung heroes fighting the COVID-19, the everyday resilience and the sense of community on the ground which has given us a silver lining during these challenging times.</p><p>Like our pioneers in the late 1960s and 1970s that have built our nation from scratch, we will be the pioneers in winning the war over COVID-19.&nbsp;We are using the reserve build up by our Pioneers to fight the current crisis.&nbsp;But, we are also want to be the pioneers that transform our economy digitally so that our children can reap the fruits of our new digital economy.&nbsp;In the fight against COVID-19, I hope all Singaporeans can proudly say “count on me”.</p><h6>11.46 am</h6><p><strong>Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his unveiling of the Fortitude budget. This budget is aptly-named because it seeks to fortify support programmes that are urgently needed across all levels of an economy beleaguered by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>I wish to focus my speech on the welcome support offered via the new SGUnited Mid-Career Traineeship Programme that aims to provide 4,000 traineeships for mid-career unemployed locals. This programme is especially timely as our country goes through rapid digitalisation, now fiercely accelerated by COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As mature workers, mid-career jobseekers are understandably anxious about the drastic confluence of digital disruptions, outmoded skills and ageism working against them. Compared to fresh graduates, their needs are more complex as many would also be from the sandwich class, juggling lifestage obligations of parenting and eldercare and so their salary expectations are naturally higher. Even though they have an established track record, they will find it harder to pivot, having honed their skills in industries that may be on the decline. And yet, with their maturity and life experience, they still have much to offer our society and ample potential to grow.</p><p>As the relevant Ministries and agencies work together to operationalise the finer details of this programme, I would like to share insights from industry leaders so that the programme can bring maximum benefit to the trainees and companies participating in this scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Principally, industry leaders recommend that expectations of both sides must be carefully managed to heighten mutual understanding and satisfaction with the programme. The participating companies’ should be supported with instructive guidelines on how best to integrate and upskill their trainees. MOM should provide some flexibility and support for employers across a group of complementary companies to offer cross-training opportunities.</p><p>For example, career portal Mums@Work has successfully experimented with developing consortia of companies in related industries collaborating to collectively train returning talents so that they can be exposed to a broader swathe of skills. Trainees can thus explore multiple career paths and better identify their transferable strengths in the process.</p><p>With such innovative arrangements, companies can offer their trainees a wider range of skills upgrading opportunities and support each other without incurring prohibitive overheads.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies should also be upfront with their trainees about the potential for longer term job prospects or the lack thereof, and share in advance the kinds of post traineeship support they can provide. They should also be more explicit about articulating their criteria for retention if they can afford to increase their headcount. That way, the trainees will not feel like they have been led down the garden path.</p><p>Besides such substantive issues, the approach that participating companies adopt in hosting these trainees can also make or break a traineeship. There are horror stories of job attachment schemes where mature trainees must sign in daily for a visitor’s pass to enter the company, or who are supervised by very junior colleagues with no managerial experience to speak of. These socio-emotional aspects of mid-career training must be effectively addressed to ensure win-win outcomes for everyone. Above all, the scheme must accord trainees with a sense of purpose and dignity.&nbsp;</p><p>On their part, trainees must also pull their weight and not regard the traineeship as a paid sabbatical. They too should be provided with pointers on how they can make the most of their stints and the appropriate mind sets they should adopt to fully benefit from the programme.&nbsp;</p><p>Fundamentally, the traineeships should offer a combination of substantive skills and career planning competencies that will empower these mid-career jobseekers for their next career move.</p><p>In this regard, the experience of the Singapore Computer Society’s Career Compass programme offers some valuable lessons. Besides providing training in technical skills relating to growth areas such as AI, cyber security and enterprise architecture, the programme also offers career preparatory training in areas such as professional branding, resume building and interview skills.</p><p>With a careful and concerted design of SGUnited Mid-Career Traineeship offerings and actionable guidelines for participating companies and trainees, I am hopeful that this scheme can help to prepare mid-career workers for the next phase of their careers. On that optimistic note, I support the Fortitude Budget.</p><h6>11.51 am</h6><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the $33 billion Fortitude Budget. This is an unprecedented Budget but it is necessary as this is one of the worst crises to hit us in our nation’s history.</p><p>Many of my residents in Henderson-Dawson have shared with me how they and their companies have been directly assisted by the various assistance schemes and programmes announced as parts of the Unity, Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. Many are also acutely aware that we are drawing on our reserves and have expressed their worries about drawing down on our nation’s savings, especially since we do not know how long this crisis will last.&nbsp;It is a delicate balance between the needs of our present and our future, and the Government has had to make some very tough decisions for the good of everyone in Singapore under these trying circumstances.</p><p>The central focus of the Fortitude Budget is jobs.</p><p>I am glad to see that the various age groups of our society will continue to receive assistance.&nbsp;From young graduates to middle aged employees, and to older workers, all will receive help with jobseeking, job-matching and training.&nbsp;We are especially concerned for the sandwiched workers – those who are supporting both children and elderly parents.&nbsp;I urge them to take up the various assistance schemes applicable to them and come forward to request for help if they are unsure of what to do.</p><p>It is important that even as we focus on taking care of our immediate needs, we must also be mindful of our external environment and keep an eye on what is ahead of us.</p><p>In early May, Deputy Prime Minister Heng had said that, I quote, “there should be no lost generation in Singapore… we are sailing into uncharted waters, surveying the new landscape, exploring new growth and opportunities, preparing to seize them when the storm passes...\"</p><p>I would like to speak a little about the young adults who will be joining or who had just joined our workforce. This is a world that seems so familiar and yet so different from the one they had grown up expecting to enter.</p><p>This generation had grown up hearing from their elders about how fortunate they have been, growing up enjoying the many benefits of a prosperous nation as compared to Singapore’s founding years.&nbsp;And now suddenly, within the space of a few months, the world has changed.&nbsp;It is so much harder for them to get jobs. The malls are closed. They cannot hang out with friends. Suddenly, we also have an entire generation of Romeos and Juliets, forbidden from meeting each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As this group is young, we may not be as worried as we may be for older Singaporeans. They will also receive support under the Fortitude Budget’s SGUnited Traineeship which aims to provide 21,000 traineeships for local first-time jobseekers, and there is additional support from the Hiring Incentive scheme which has been expanded to cover workers of all ages.&nbsp;Certainly, some of the 40,000 jobs to be created in the public and private sectors by the SGUnited Jobs initiative will be offered to this young cohort too.</p><p>However, being young and with less experience, they may face obstacles searching for jobs in a very tight labour market.&nbsp;</p><p>I am glad to note that MOM will take active steps to assist those who need advice and career counselling in applying for jobs and being matched with training programmes and jobs. However, for some young people, the jobs they had been preparing for may have all but disappeared and some are even at a loss about whether they should consider switching industries.Thus, the Government, together with industry and the Institutes of Higher Learning, should work&nbsp;even more closely together to help them navigate the job market in this challenging environment.</p><p>We must be mindful of the impact of this crisis on them for years to come and have the appropriate strategy to help them to ensure that they will not become a lost or traumatised generation.&nbsp;For a number of them, they are entering the adult world with “empty hands”, as their parents and family members may also face job losses or business difficulties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My concern is that as our economy recovers in the future, this cohort’s experience and their subsequent actions would have consequences for us as a nation. Even with the use of technology and solemnisations via video link, relationships and marriages may be delayed. They may delay having children, have fewer children or none at all.&nbsp;In delaying procreation, the chances of having healthy children are reduced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our family units form the foundation of our society. Matching up young single Singaporeans may hardly be a priority now but I hope the Government will be mindful of this issue as it has wide ranging implications, including our economy’s competitiveness and national security.&nbsp;</p><p>As for those who have decided to take the leap, we can do more to support these new young families. There are attractive grants in place for HDB flat purchases. Nonetheless, I would like to ask the government to help them with the repayment of their HDB loans.&nbsp;Please consider accepting even lower deposits and smaller repayments monthly.&nbsp;This need not be permanent.&nbsp;The crisis will not last forever, in three to five years, the economy will pick up and the couples can make up for the difference later.&nbsp;This will also be timely as they progress in their careers, earn more and become able to afford higher mortgage payments. I also wish to appeal for higher subsidies for pregnancy check-ups, deliveries and childhood vaccinations to make procreation even more affordable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Would MND also consider building bigger HDB flats in the future?&nbsp;Not only do bigger units allow families to continue living together and help to look after each other, they will also take into account that more citizens will be working and studying online from home. This will be become a permanent trend.&nbsp;More and more people will need a home office and increasingly, home-based learning will be part of all students’ schedule, whether during emergencies, or, regularly utilised to ensure that the system is working and that the students and teachers stay familiar with the online learning platforms.&nbsp;Such a change in working and learning patterns means that there is a need and demand for a bit more space, with internal dividers, for all members of a family to do their jobs and studying sustainably, without disturbing one another.</p><p>Let us support our young adults who are standing at the entrance of independence and parenthood.&nbsp;Encourage them to proceed to the next lap with those they love. The pandemic will pass. And throughout the way, we will help everyone to tide through these tough times together.</p><h6>11.59 am</h6><p><strong>Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Fortitude Budget sets aside $33 billion more to help firms and households, and to save jobs. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it a health and economic crisis that has Singapore facing the worst recession since Independence. Our Government’s response has had no precedent – unstinting and rapid support to the tune of $93 billion thus far, resulting in the largest overall Budget deficit in our nation’s history.</p><p>Including this Budget, the Government will need to draw up to $52 billion dollars from its reserves. It is indeed a blessing that Singapore should possess such a reservoir of financial resources to see us through this crisis. Many countries around the world will be burdened, burdened in the years to come with record levels of debt from the huge fiscal stimulus programmes they have had to put in place to deal with the impact from COVID-19. So, we are more fortunate.</p><p>But, Sir, there is no question that Singapore was absolutely right to tap the reserves decisively in order to help businesses, tide Singaporeans through this crisis and mitigate permanent damage to our economy. However, we should also be concerned about fiscal sustainability, especially when the outlook remains uncertain and downside risks remain significant. There is a lot of talk about what would the shape of the recovery be, but many believe that recovery will&nbsp;be slow and long-drawn; it may take years before we return to pre-COVID-19 conditions.</p><p>Against this backdrop, I wonder how this massive draw on our reserves will be treated. What are the obligations to pay back? To do so, would be a huge task as the amount is more than 10 times our previous draw, when we used it to deal with the Global Financial Crisis. How will this influence our tax policy in the coming years, as we work to restore public finances in an equitable manner? Will we need to dig deeper, to implement more progressive income taxes and greater wealth taxes? Will tax systems need to evolve in tandem with the rising digital economy and capture revenue earned from online transactions?</p><p>With the economic outlook remaining highly uncertain and with risks predominantly skewed to the downside, we should be very cautious when we do further draws on our reserves. I support the call to set aside a sum of $13 billion in Contingencies Funds, but, I must urge the Government to do so with utmost prudence.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted businesses and workers unevenly.&nbsp;I urge Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat to adopt in the next phase, if he has to do something, a more targeted approach in future support schemes.</p><p>For example, the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), payouts should only go to firms adversely impacted by the crisis. We should learn from Australia. In Australia, for their scheme, eligibility for wage support only kicks in if business turnover drops by 30% due to the pandemic; for larger companies with turnovers of over A$1 billion, their drop in turnover must be at least 50% before they can be eligible.&nbsp;It should not be right for firms to profit from the Government\\'s support scheme during this crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>For some companies, whose bottom lines have been boosted because of JSS, they should be offered the opportunity to \"pay it forward\", in support of others who are less fortunate, perhaps through a \"Solidarity Levy\" of some sort.</p><p>Sir, this crisis will increase income inequality. Recent research at Oxford found that those earning under GBP20,000 are less able to perform work remotely, earn a smaller proportion of their previous salary and are twice as likely to lose their jobs compared to those earning GBP40,000 or more.&nbsp;We can draw similar parallels here in Singapore. It has been far easier for those employed by large companies and highly skilled sectors to work remotely, than for those employed by SMEs or in the retail and F&amp;B sectors, as well as those engaged in low-paying contract work. So, we must find ways to buffer the hardship faced by these families. We should be prepared to support them with some basic level of income beyond the current provision of COVID-19 Support Grant, should their unemployment persist.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support Deputy Prime Minister\\'s call to think urgently about how Singapore can emerge stronger. We must prepare our workforce immediately for a post COVID-19 environment, to adapt quickly to structural changes in the economy, changed consumer habits and new ways in which countries will compete and co-operate with one another.</p><p>I also applaud Deputy Prime Minister for his bold move to launch the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, creating 100,000 opportunities in jobs, traineeships and skills training to mitigate risks associated with unemployment.</p><p>The Deputy Prime Minister has promised to \"protect every worker even if we cannot protect every job\". But this commitment to protect every worker should not create a false sense of security or complacency. Instead, it should encourage individuals to leverage this safety net in order to position themselves for the longer term, by critically assessing their operating environment, learn new skills, try new jobs and seize on the many schemes available to ensure that they remain relevant.</p><p>The formation of National Jobs Council as well as the Emerging Stronger Task Force are great initiatives for developing strategies to pivot ourselves to the new jobs landscape.&nbsp;I am also impressed with the speed by which job initiatives are being rolled out – these include the 11,000 traineeships by 1,000 organisations who have come on board so far, so quite impressive.</p><p>Our ability to coordinate, navigate and implement Whole-of-Government initiatives is truly the competitive advantage that Singapore must play to.</p><p>Amidst the doom and gloom, it is reassuring to learn that Singapore has secured $13 billion of investment commitments in just four months of this year – amongst the highest in recent years.&nbsp;This is a testament of the confidence that investors and businesses have in Singapore and the hard work that MTI continues to put into selling \"Singapore Inc\". Indeed, as social, political and geopolitical instability continue to play out elsewhere in the world, Singapore is well positioned as the much-sought-after safe harbor for business, talent, intellectual property and investments.</p><p>Sir, COVID-19 has changed many long-held beliefs and opened up new perspectives. I think many of us&nbsp;believed that Singaporeans were not attracted to care-giving jobs, so we were always going to be heavily reliant on foreign nurses and care-giving professionals. However, our response to the pandemic shone a light on the meaningful work that healthcare professionals do and held them up as the heroes that they have always been.&nbsp;School children wrote \"thank you\" notes, Prime Ministers called them out and people clapped from their balconies the world over, out of gratitude for their sacrifice. The large number of temporary positions made available to deal with COVID-19 has also provided a window of opportunity for people to try their hand at this work. I must say I am so encouraged to witnessed an emerging&nbsp;interest amongst young people in joining the healthcare industry and shifting attitudes towards the care-giving profession. Sir, we should seize upon this window of opportunity to accelerate this trend and attract more Singaporeans to join the healthcare profession that offers great long-term career prospects.</p><p>Lastly, COVID-19 has taught us that large-scale remote working is indeed possible. With the help of technology, employers are quickly equipping their workers with the tools they need to work from home. I myself have been surprised at how much more productive I have been, working away from the office. Facebook has begun planning for workers to work permanently from home, whilst Google has extended its work-from-home policy for the remainder of 2020.</p><p>With working remotely accepted as the new normal, we should leverage this opportunity to&nbsp;supercharge Singapore\\'s growth in the Infocomm Technology sector (ICT). Many tech firms complain that they have not been able to scale their business in Singapore given our limited talent pool.&nbsp;With the accelerated plan to build a strong pipeline of digital and technology skills locally as announced by Minister Iswaran yesterday, companies can also supplement the local talent pool with global expertise to scale the business by&nbsp;extending working from home beyond our national borders. So, extend that, work from home, but beyond the national borders. Singapore companies can tap AI, data analytics, cybersecurity resources from around the world to support Singapore\\'s development work without these tech professionals having to relocate to Singapore.&nbsp;Our innovations in organising work and how work should be done, can fuel our ambition to be Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise.</p><p>I urge the Emerging Stronger Task Force Committee to scrutinise these and other trends emerging from this COVID-19 pandemic, so that it may inform their recommendations to prepare Singaporeans for a post COVID era.&nbsp;Winston Churchill is credited with first saying, \"Never let a good crisis go to waste\". Singapore has certainly invested a good deal in this crisis, it is time to learn the lessons, turn challenges into opportunities and reap the rewards for a stronger, brighter tomorrow. I support the Budget.</p><h6>12.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I join many Singaporeans in thanking the Government for the Unity, Resilience, Solidarity and Fortitude Budgets. The support measures introduced will help ensure that we can all get through this pandemic and most importantly, get through it together.</p><p>I am thankful that the concerns of those on unpaid leave or reduced salaries have been addressed through expanding the COVID-19 Support Grant to help this group of Singaporeans.&nbsp;I am thankful we are proposing to help the SMEs with further rental waivers and allow tenants to repay their arrears through installments.&nbsp;I am also thankful for all the hard work by MOM, all the other Government agencies and the NGOs who have worked tirelessly to help our migrant friends. Our migrant friends have worked hard to build, clean and maintain Singapore as the shining red dot we are today. I am glad we have not left them behind and have committed to improving their living conditions. I raised all these concerns in my previous speeches and I am thankful to everyone who has taken the time to share your concerns, feedback and suggestions with me. Thank you for speaking up.</p><p>&nbsp;Sir, we have given a lot but as I raised in my previous speeches, there is one more thing we need to give out. We can and we need to give time. Time for working parents to spend with and look after their young children during this difficult period.</p><p>&nbsp;During this pandemic, many parents are feeling the stress of trying to balance work and looking after their children, especially helping their young ones with home-based learning (HBL).&nbsp;As Zack, a parent, shared with me, \"Imagine working from 9.00 am to 6.00 pm. Reached home about 7.00 pm. Have dinner until 7.30 pm. And only having this time, 7.30 pm to 9.00 pm, to check on the kids\\' HBL. Kids must sleep at 9.00 pm to ensure nine hours of healthy sleep. Super tiring. Yet, we endured for the sake of our children\".&nbsp;</p><p>Many parents are especially worried about how they will cope with alternating weeks of HBL for non-graduating students. It will be difficult for parents who are unable to work from home. Who will look after their children? Not everyone has grandparents who can help and even for those who do, they might not be able to help during this period.</p><p>&nbsp;Another parent shared with me, \"I have two Primary school going kids. Primary 1, Primary 2. Who is available to guide them on HBL days during Phase One? Grandparents aren’t computer literate. If there isn’t any HBL plus Google meet plus video call, I will choose to deposit them at my parents house easily. If I have to take annual leave to guide their HBL, employer won’t allow.\"</p><p>I know Minister Ong has stated, \"Schools will be prepared to extend limited care to young students on HBL but without childcare arrangements\".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;It will also be difficult for parents who can work from home. They are expected to meet their bosses\\' deadline and to be equally productive, even as they try to give their young ones attention and guide them on HBL. Do they please their employers or the children?</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">I know firsthand how difficult it is. For the past two months, I worked from home with three little ones who had HBL. Ella is now six years old and Katie and Poppy are three years old. You cannot leave them to do HBL on their own. It is impossible.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">They have also attended many of my Zoom work meetings, climbed on my shoulders when I am clearing emails, and pulled my hands and legs, wanting me to play with them when I am drafting speeches. This happened when I was drafting this speech last Saturday.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Parents truly appreciate this opportunity to work from home. As Zyen, another parent, shared, “WFH with an infant is really no joke. Always have to work till midnight to complete the work. But I do, really cherish and appreciate. I‘ve been there when she flipped, sat up by herself and now standing with support. Gonna miss this bittersweet timing”.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Sir, more than anything, parents feel guilty that we cannot give our children the attention they need even though they are right there in front of us.&nbsp;I am not the only one with kids climbing on my shoulders. Amelia shared that, “My son climbs onto my shoulders while I work, too. I feel guilty for being impatient with my daughter who asks questions or wants to share something with me while I’m rushing my work”.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">I know there is no easy solution, especially during these difficult times. I know employers are equally stressed.&nbsp;But we need to give parents some breathing space and help them balance both work and family commitments.&nbsp;It is good that the Government has asked employers to be more empathetic to the challenges working parents face but we need to do more than that.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">We cannot leave this important issue to the discretion of the employer. The Government needs to step in to help and to mandate like how we have done so in so many areas in tackling this pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">We need to remember the issue does not just stem from alternating weeks of HBL. What about parents whose children are required to stay home because they are exhibiting COVID-like symptoms? Many pre-schools rightly ask a child to go home if he or she shows a single symptom. But a lot of parents are affected because of this.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">An educator in a childcare centre shared with me that, “On the ground, parents tend to negotiate with teachers if teachers were to reject children from entering schools due to respiratory symptoms with reasons that they are unable to get leave from work or no one to take care of their children”. Some parents, “would suggest to teachers to keep children at the sick bay the entire day until the parents end work”.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Let us not forget that there are also school closures due to positive COVID-19 cases, Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notices.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">As I have previously stressed, our current childcare leave entitlement is already insufficient during a regular year.&nbsp;Now, in the most irregular year, how can parents possibly have sufficient childcare leave?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">The only option left for many parents is unpaid leave. Indeed, many parents have shared that they are doing just that. But in this business climate, parents fear losing their jobs if they continue to take unpaid leave.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">To help parents, I hope we can introduce a Government-paid COVID-19-related childcare leave for parents whose children need to stay home due to COVID-19-related issues. By calling for it to be Government-paid, this would ease the financial burden for employers, whom I know are equally stressed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Sir, this leave is critical for those who are unable to work from home. This includes parents working in essential services who perform a duty for our nation, who keep us safe. We need to make sure that they are looked after, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">For parents who are working from home, this COVID-19-related childcare leave can help take off the pressures of balancing competing work and childcare responsibilities. They can take this leave when needed, such as helping their child catch up with HBL and their school work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Sir, we will not be the first country to provide a COVID-19-related childcare leave. Other countries have already taken steps to help working parents facing childcare challenges as a result of this pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">In the US, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act expands paid leave options for working parents who are unable to find childcare arrangements, entitling them up to 12 weeks of partially paid family leave. This includes parents working from home.&nbsp;Businesses whose employees take this leave pay for it through a refundable tax credit administered by the Department of Treasury.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">In Canada, working parents are entitled to job-protected leave of absence for up to 16 weeks under federal law, allowing parents to attend to childcare and eldercare needs while protecting them from being fired or penalised.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">In Italy, the government extended annual parental leave by 15 days for parents with children aged up to 12 years.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">In Belgium, the government introduced a special parental leave for parents of children under the age of 12 where parents can take leave in the form of 1/2 or 1/5 reduction of working time. This means working half time or one day off a week, taken in any combination of weekly or monthly blocks.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Other countries have adopted a variety of measures – tax credits, protection against discriminatory firing, increase in annual leave and flexible leave. I believe some combination of these solutions would provide our working parents the support they so desperately need.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Sir, in conclusion, we cannot leave it to employers and employees to work out amicable arrangements to balance business needs with childcare needs in this difficult time. In this difficult time, the Government has to step in. We should; other countries have already done so.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">I hope the Government will consider introducing a Government-paid COVID-19-related childcare leave and provide it at least until the end of Phase Two of the re-opening after the circuit breaker.&nbsp;Many parents are calling for this and I hope the Government will support them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">“Spend time with those you love, one of these days you will either say I wish I had or I’m glad I did.”</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Let us give our working parents the time they need to spend with their children during this pandemic and let us all value the precious time we have with our loved ones.&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget. Together, we will beat this virus.</span></p><h6>12.21 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, before I start, I would like to thank Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his team at MOF for their hard work in devising a fourth Budget within a space of four months. I also appreciate the sensitive consideration of naming each Budget such that we are emotionally connected to them.</p><p>\"Fortitude\" is an excellent name for this Budget as we dig deep into courage to face the painful effects of an unfolding economic crisis. The pain is widespread. Many have reached out to me with their stories. Witnessing this suffering has compelled me to file cuts tomorrow, so that the issues faced by struggling groups are raised to this House. Public rental households are one such group.</p><p>The number of households who have suffered complete loss of income since the beginning of April has risen sharply. Average income levels have gone into freefall. On the ground, community organisations have observed that households face mounting debt, including rent arrears. MND shared that “about 5,200 public rental households, or about 10% of all public rental households, are in rent arrears”. Around one in four such households owes more than $3,000 in rent.</p><p>As the economic impact of COVID-19 worsens, we can expect that more households residing in rental flats will struggle to pay rent. The Deputy Prime Minister said in his Ministerial Statement last week, \"Our path forward will be tough, but we will journey together\". So, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he could consider waiving six months’ rent for all households residing in rental flats, except for those whose rent is already covered under financial assistance from ComCare. This will provide immediate and targeted relief that goes directly to the low-income households in need.</p><p>For context, the Government is extending $334 million in rental relief for Government tenants in this Budget. A further $2 billion will offset SMEs’ rental costs.<sup>. </sup>A similar waiver for rental flat households would cost between $16 million and $57 million, based on my rough calculation.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, while acute pain is undeniable and deeply felt by both citizens and migrant workers, future shocks could be more frequent and unprecedented. The World Economic Forum has called turbulence “the new normal” in its latest Global Risks Report. I will focus on the long term in this speech.</p><p>The hard work of Singaporeans and Singapore companies, as well as prudent financial management of our Reserves, has allowed us to save up for this rainy day. It is only fiscally responsible for us to ensure that we spend the monies to build a stronger foundation for this new turbulent normal. This demands that we push boundaries and reimagine a social and economic structure that is more responsive, flexible and interconnected.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, let me first outline why a re-imagination and deep transformation is the only prudent way forward. I will then discuss the considerations in our current spending and planning processes that can set us on the path towards this stronger, more sustainable and more inclusive future.</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng mentioned that this Budget’s focus is to “enable our businesses and workers to adapt, transform and seize new opportunities”. Indeed, but even more so, our society and economy need a deep transformation.</p><p>The COVID-19 crisis has shown us unequivocally that human health is intrinsically linked to planetary health. Our increasing urbanisation and disruption of ecological balances increase our risks of exposure to pathogens. Last year, the Clinicians for Planetary Health initiative was launched. It committed to increase awareness of the severe public health impacts of environmental change. Therefore, it is safe to say that to safeguard our economic future, the balance of resources across people, planet and profit needs to be re-examined.</p><p>First, we can no longer look at our risk response in silo. Risks are multi-dimensional and cross-cutting, and must be addressed as such. Our healthcare system had integrated and implemented the playbook from SARS well – only 3.1% of our infections had been healthcare workers so far, compared to 41% for SARS. Yet, systemic gaps in worker welfare, specifically for migrant workers, left us unprepared for the infection levels in the dormitories. The risk assessment framework should have included the adequacy of safeguards for worker health. This would have required MOH and MOM to work together.</p><p>Second, existing societal inequities create disproportionate stresses on vulnerable communities. My previous speeches provided several examples of persons with mental health conditions, lower income households and migrant workers being disproportionately affected in terms of income loss and economic and psychological resilience. The digital divide amongst lower income families, the differently-abled and the elderly became more evident. All these could deepen social and community fault lines.</p><p>What does all this mean in terms of transformation? What society should we envision for ourselves?</p><p>I call for Singapore to move towards multi-stakeholderism. Governance-wise, this means a policy design process centred around and in collaboration with the actors with a “stake” in the outcome. Business-wise, it means considering workers, suppliers and customers equally.</p><p>Such considerations are not new. The World Economic Forum was established in 1971 to further the idea that business should serve all stakeholders. A hundred and eighty one CEOs of the Business Roundtable signed a statement last year, committing “to lead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders – customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.”</p><p>Investors also value businesses that take care of its stakeholders. Workers are a major stakeholder. In April 2020, the International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) led by investors responsible for assets of $54 trillion called for companies to “prioritise employee safety and welfare” and “take a holistic and equitable approach to capital allocation decisions, considering the workforce”. Deputy Prime Minister Heng alluded to similar sentiments in parts of his speech.</p><p>The Government’s strategy to help Singaporeans ride through this crisis is by safeguarding jobs and income, which it is doing by supporting businesses. Across all four Budgets, around $28 billion has gone towards supporting immediate cash flow needs and overheads. This is about a third of the total Budget to date. The Government has also provided support through enabling credit access and matching investments for start-ups.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the intention to protect jobs and income to strengthen the economic position of our individuals and households. Reducing inequality would also increase resilience across our society, especially in times of hardship, so that economic buffers and important resources do not become accessible only to the privileged few.</p><p>Therefore, we must enact measures to protect individuals against employers who may be more interested in self-enrichment than in their workers’ rice bowls. Possible measures are curbs on layoffs, excessive executive compensation, and excessive use of share options in compensation structures that disproportionately align managers only to shareholders’ interests.</p><p>Government bailouts and support may reduce shareholders’ risk-bearing responsibilities. Safeguards against moral hazard can include: reducing dividends, restricting stock buybacks and requiring that any M&amp;A activity should seek to pay back the support provided, that is, a clawback.</p><p>Measuring and reporting should be used to hold companies accountable for how they have used Government grants, therefore taxpayers’ monies. An example is the independent accountability and transparency board created by the Obama administration in 2009. It performed a crucial monitoring function by requiring any entity receiving contracts, grants, or loans to file quarterly reports.&nbsp;</p><p>We could adopt a similar mechanism to ensure that companies channel Government support to those for whom it is intended. Corporate reporting requirements could compel companies to demonstrate behaviours that meet broader societal and sustainability goals.&nbsp;</p><p>We must also use the support packages as carrots for companies to actively enhance social equity by integrating community engagement and social responsibility into business strategy, so each can be a Company of Good&nbsp;– a national effort I believe Deputy Prime Minister is very familiar with. This could include an obligation to judiciously use the Business and IPC Partnership Scheme or BIPs, to make in-kind donations to charities.</p><p>Lastly, promoting sustainable business models will be key to building a better and safer future. McKinsey noted in April that “not only does climate action remain critical over the next decade, but investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and the transition to a lower carbon future can drive significant near-term job creation while increasing economic and environmental resiliency.” The President of the German Parliament recently called for the stimulus plan to focus on “climate policy, digitisation and innovation”.</p><p>Subsidies and support to companies accelerating climate change should come with conditions for absolute emissions reductions that enable us to accelerate our Paris Agreement commitments. As countries grapple with what a green and healthy recovery looks like, measurement and accountability may again be instrumental for change. The Task Force of Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework should be the norm. Science-based targets should form the basis of discussions on business transformations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Such requirements could be considered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as a cornerstone of future environment risk management guidelines for our financial industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These safeguards will require strong political will, Mr Deputy Speaker, because they will meet with resistance. But if we want a flexible and responsive society that is able to absorb shocks and rebound from them, I believe we must recalibrate current power structures for a fairer economy that considers key stakeholders in our economic system equally. I hope Deputy Prime Minister addresses this need for safeguards and conditions in his response.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government is demonstrating its commitment to longer term planning through the Emerging Stronger Task Force and the Future Economy Council. I applaud the intention. However, if we are to recognise a wide range of stakeholders in our future and commit to re-imagining the way forward, changes must be made.&nbsp;</p><p>I am glad to hear Deputy Prime Minister note that the Task Force will partner with SME owners, industry experts and trade associations as part of Emerging Stronger and his invitation for Singaporeans to participate. I would like to ask Deputy Prime Minister if there are plans to formalise this partnership and citizen participation under this Task Force. This is necessary to integrate meaningful and transparent input from all corners of society.</p><p>The current members of the Task Force represent industries that we have traditionally treated as pillars of our current economic structure, the composition does not represent the true diversity of economic players in Singapore. For example, I am surprised by the omission of SME, minority, even disability and mental health representation. Companies committed to delivering a sustainable future are also unrepresented, under-represented. So are women. I believe that if we sideline these views now, we are sabotaging our own futures and those of our children’s. Can I please ask the Deputy Prime Minister to ensure a more diverse and better representation on this Task Force to secure a truly resilient and united future for Singapore?&nbsp;</p><p>Unity, resilience, solidarity, fortitude. The names of the four extraordinary Budgets this year speak to our desire as a nation to overcome this crisis together and stronger. Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe that emerging stronger means placing our people front and centre of our plans for the future. Our economic structures must be realigned to put people first so that we build back better as a well-being economy&nbsp;post COVID. It will take our collective imagination, courage and collaboration to walk through this crisis and emerge stronger, together. Let us start the work for that to happen today with fortitude. I support the Budget.</p><h6>12.35 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;I welcome the $33 billion Fortitude Budget which will be used to counter the heavy impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our country. All governments around the world are taking unprecedented measures to mitigate the damaging impact of this outbreak and save the lives and livelihoods of their people.&nbsp;We are similar.&nbsp;Fortunately, past prudence has provided us with adequate emergency funds.&nbsp;</p><p>We are in the midst of a brutal war, the pandemic has claimed over 370,000 lives in the world within a few months.&nbsp;Fortunately, we have managed to keep most of our people here safe and the death rate low.&nbsp;This is a challenging war against the virus.&nbsp;It is different from other outbreaks that we have come across so far.&nbsp;To my understanding, it is infectious even a person has not developed any symptoms.&nbsp;Asymptomatic infections have made this task of overcoming it even more challenging and difficult.</p><p>Notwithstanding, we have to soldier on under these very trying circumstances, be resilient, stay united and help one another to overcome the obstacles ahead of us.&nbsp;We Singaporeans need to stay focused on a sustainable approach.&nbsp;By and large, we understand there is a limit to the handouts we can if we do not find sustainable income that provide long term and permanent social and family safety nets. Sir, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-Gan Thiam Poh Fortitude 5June2020-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>I am heartened by the effort to save and create jobs.&nbsp;I hope that more jobs can be created for the middle and senior age groups, particularly quality jobs. I am heartened by the response of our residents to the job offers, their willingness and courage in picking up new skills and adapting. I am glad that the Government has been focused on helping Singaporeans to both upskill and become equipped with new skills, to stay competitive and relevant in response to the market changes. There is a Chinese saying “When rowing a boat upstream, if one does not move forward, the boat will go backwards downstream”. Our people must persist in their efforts forward so that we can secure our place in the world.</p><p>More assistance will still need to be given to help Singaporeans, as the recovery of the world economy may not be so fast. For those who were retrenched last year and earlier, and had not been able to find jobs, they need help with job matching and retraining. This is especially for those aged above 40. In addition, some have expressed concerns that even with training, it does not necessarily lead to a job.&nbsp;</p><p>While the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) and Self-Employed Persons Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) provide welcomed relief, more salary or wage support can be given to help ease Singaporeans to upskill or reskill without having to worry about maintaining the family. I would like to suggest that we look at income matching, for example, a dollar to every two dollars earned for the 6 to 12 months, subject to a cap and overall scheme support budget of $9,000 per person under SIRS. This may be more sustainable.</p><p>Singaporeans should also adapt to tap upon technology and target not just Singapore, but the world as their market. Recently, a Singaporean actor took on a side job selling seafood for his friends on the Internet. To everyone’s surprise, including himself, he became an Internet celebrity, and companies and talent agencies from China rushed to contact him as their partner, asking him to promote all kinds of goods on the Internet. This is a very popular way of selling goods in China’s huge market today.&nbsp;While some of his language may be too colourful, his adaptability had created new opportunities for him. He can look forward to a very interesting new career. In Singapore, the Government has already started helping stallholders sell online and do live-streaming sales. Let us hope more business owners will try to change their operating models.</p><p>There has been feedback that there are still many who have been struggling with their businesses and who have been making sacrifices for the circuit breaker to the extent that they have been lending to their companies with their pay to support cashflow. Some have appealed for the Job Support Scheme (JSS) for working directors who are also shareholders. Instead of limiting the JSS to those who earn below $100,000 a year, why not remove this income cap? After all, the JSS is capped at 75% of $4,650.</p><p>Some are concerned that their businesses may not pick up after the reopening of our economy and thus will continue to face financial difficulty. It is important to them that all their clients order can be resumed.&nbsp;Otherwise, such business cannot hang on much longer. Even with the salary support from the Government, many businesses cannot afford to pay the balance 25% because they have zero revenue.</p><p>While we need to prioritise safety, and indeed, being a highly interconnected hub, we can only be safe if the world is also safe, however, we cannot be closed off from the world. It will do more harm than good to “de-globalise”.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to be proactive, not passive, to overcome this challenge. In order to survive, we cannot afford to sit back and keep drawing upon our past reserves and assets.</p><p>For example, we could consider staycations now that our community infection rate has been controlled. We should also start thinking how we could have effective and efficient test kits to check on all inbound travellers and returnees to prevent imported cases while revitalising the aviation, tourism and MICE sectors.</p><p>Most importantly, those who have the ability should help the have-nots. Because everyone is important and we care for all. Finally, let me conclude with a limerick.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>January: Complain about having to start work again</p><p>February: Panic buying of paper products</p><p>March: Causeway closed</p><p>April: Everyone stayed home&nbsp;</p><p>May: Resumption of work we hope&nbsp;</p><p>June: Worry about savings being depleted</p><p>July: Pray all will go smoothly</p><p>August: Celebrate victory</p><p>With this, I would like to conclude with my support for this Budget. Thank you.</p><h6>12.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Budget.</p><p>Twenty-twenty is a year to reset, regroup and relearn. What is before us, is unprecedented. It is both a health crisis and an economic crisis that affects our life, our health and how we live our lives.</p><p>But far beyond our personal spheres, the world is rapidly changing. Tensions near and far, threaten to destabilise our once predictable place in the world. Global supply chains are also changing as countries ramp up their \"nationalistic\" strategies.&nbsp;Singapore has always depended on free and open trade. We need to regroup and strategise what is next for us, what can steer our economy into the future where businesses can thrive and individuals can progress.</p><p>Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we chart our path forward, I am particularly concerned about the challenges faced by our SMEs, especially the micro-businesses in our neighbourhood and hawkers. It is encouraging that the Government has set up the Emerging Stronger Task Force to study the systemic shifts emerging out of COVID-19. Other countries are also gradually ramping up their economies as they emerge out of lockdowns. We need to swiftly identify the economic shifts and strategise the way forward. Can the Minister for Finance shed some light on the work done so far and its first findings? How can we take advantage of new opportunities and accelerate our economic rebound?&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, in March 2018, I spoke about how we in our 40s today will become seniors of the future who will be more tech savvy and self-sufficient. We are also likely to be able to retire later as technology allows us to work from home. This COVID-19 pandemic has also affected seniors in many ways. I would like to highlight digital transformation. Microsoft estimates that two years of digital transformation was accomplished in the last two months. Forbes estimates five years of digital transformation to occur before mid 2021. These impacts have also been felt by our seniors, many of whom now communicate with video calls using WhatsApp or Zoom – something unheard of in 2019. Some seniors are also learning to shop online. Although there are no local studies released, in 2019, 40% of seniors aged 65 and above in Germany shop online.</p><p>As we forge ahead in our new post COVID-19 world, I anticipate far more online participation by our seniors than ever before.&nbsp;How can we capitalise on this digital transformation? How can we enable our seniors to be less isolated, more engaged with each other and with our society? What can we do with technology to help seniors connect with their families and friends and continue contributing to society and the economy even as they continue to earn a wage? As we protect the lives of our seniors by social distancing, we should also take care of their quality of social life by using technology.</p><p>I am heartened that the SG Digital Office will be hiring 1,000 Digital Ambassadors to help hawkers and seniors learn digital skills. It is great that the Government is reaching out to help bridge our digital divide and at the same time provide employment opportunities&nbsp;for our graduating cohorts of ITE, Polytechnics and Universities. I hope MCI will continue to accelerate our digitisation efforts post COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no doubt what we are experiencing is unprecedented. I hope when we look back to this period in the future, we can say we overcame&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;with unity, solidarity, resilience and fortitude. Let us press on.</p><h6>12.49 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir I support the initiatives introduced in Deputy Prime Minister Heng\\'s Ministerial Statement delivered in this House last week to protect Singaporeans\\' lives and livelihoods.&nbsp;He and hon Members who spoke before me, highlighted the deteriorating economic situation globally as well as in Singapore.</p><p>Against this deteriorating situation, I am heartened that Deputy Prime Minister Heng made good his promise made in this House when he was delivering the Ministerial Statement on the Resilience Budget. He said, \"should it become necessary, I am prepared to propose to the President further draws on past reserves to deal with the situation.\"</p><p>Our past reserves has been characterised as our trump card to get out of this crisis. Indeed, it is fortunate that we can draw on our past reserves, thanks to the prudence of previous generations of Government Leaders and Singaporeans.&nbsp;But equally, it is fortunate that Singapore can count on two further trump cards. They are: our exceptional people, who are all united in the common goal of defeating this virus and its effects on our health and economy; and our excellent men and women of the civil service. By civil service, I also include our Statutory Boards and our uniformed Services. I wish to record my appreciation to the officers in these Government agencies who have been working tirelessly throughout this crisis.</p><p>We all know our civil service is a lean organisation. With the formulation and implementation of numerous Government budgetary programmes and measures as well as legislation passed in this House within short periods of time, these officers had to rapidly adapt and assume even more responsibilities to support Singaporeans during this turbulent period. I, like a good number of hon Members have received reply emails from Government agencies on petitions written on behalf of residents promptly, despite a spike in the numbers. Many of these replies are received well after office hours.</p><p>The Government agencies and partners dealing with applications to draw on the Government\\'s COVID-19 support programmes do not have an easy task at all. They need to strike a balance between providing help to fellow Singaporeans, ensuring that the policy objectives of the programmes and legislation are achieved and satisfying themselves that the public resources are judiciously spent. At the same time, I am delighted to note that more and more, our Government agencies apply a degree of flexibility in assessing applications.</p><p>As an example, I recently received a note from a Senior Director of MSF who conveyed to me that MSF would administer the COVID-19 Support Grants (CSG) flexibly and not just by closely adhering to the criteria. This will ensure the policy objective of CSG of supporting lower to middle income Singaporeans who have lost their jobs, lost a significant proportion of the income or placed under no-pay leave are better served.</p><p>This is a welcome development. Our civil service is also transforming in its delivery efforts to better serve fellow Singaporeans. When we and our nation recover from this crisis, we should not forget the services of our men and women in civil service who went beyond their call of duty. In my view, it is not enough to pat them on their backs. We must follow up and provide tangible compensation to them. I made a similar call for our heroic frontline officers in my speech during the debate on the Unity Budget.</p><p>I would like to make three points in my speech on the Fortitude Budget. First, providing a permanent legal framework to help small businesses in crises, like the one we currently face. Second, encouraging the stakeholders in the charity sector to collaborate more so as to deliver more impactful programmes for Singaporeans who need help. And finally, providing more credit and cash flow assistance to middle income families.</p><p>On the first point, I am cheered by Deputy Prime Minister Heng\\'s announcement of the Government\\'s decision to introduce a Bill, mandating the more muscular landlords to grant rental waivers to the SME tenants whose businesses have been severely affected because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This measure deals with a big bugbear on the ground, given that most businesses in commercial premises have been closed for two months and are likely to be closed for at least a few more weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Heng mentioned that this was not an easy decision. He said \"Government does not ordinarily intervene in contracts after they have been entered into\". I appreciate the point Deputy Prime Minister Heng made.</p><p>This was the stance that was taken on behalf of the Government when I spoke on my Adjournment Motion \"Power Imbalance in Contracts Involving Small Businesses\" on the 5 February 2018. Then, I argued for Government intervention in form of legislation to protect small businesses to equalise their bargaining positions.&nbsp;I highlighted clauses in tenancy agreements that operate unfairly against tenants which are small businesses. I also drew examples of legislation being enacted in a number of advanced jurisdictions to help small businesses. The hon Senior Minister of State for Law as she then was,&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah stated as follows: \"In Singapore, our underlying philosophy is that, in general, free-market principles should apply and the Government should intervene only when necessary, for example, to address systemic market failure. Even when we do so, we try as far as possible to have the right regulatory touch and avoid heavy-handed interventions that could lead to distortion or unintended consequences\".</p><p>At this point in time, given the severe impact of COVID-19 pandemic on small businesses, especially in the F&amp;B and retail industries, I think it is right for Government to intervene to protect them or else they will disappear and the employees will be stranded.&nbsp;As it is well-known, two-third of Singaporeans are employed by SMEs.</p><p>The question I have is on whether we should take a temporary or permanent approach in dealing with such matters. Now that the Government has recognised that there is a need for intervention to help small businesses during crises, should there not be a permanent framework that can be applied as and when the situation calls for it in the future?</p><p>To illustrate the point, let us consider the important role the Price Control Act, an act which the Deputy Speaker is very familiar with, played during the crisis. The Price Control Act or PCA was enacted in 1950 to control prices of goods and to prevent price gouging. This was engaged in 1973 to fix the price of rice when it rose as a result panic buying, in the wake of the oil crisis. It is also used in 1990 when the pork market was reportedly cornered by a few suppliers. So, this is a lever that can be used when sellers take&nbsp;advantage of the situation created by crises.&nbsp;</p><p>Between January and February 2020, hon Members will recall that there was a public outcry against unscrupulous sellers taking advantage of the COVID-19 outbreak to sell surgical masks, thermometers and hand sanitisers at grossly inflated prices. The Price Controller took swift action under powers vested in him under PCA by requiring the sellers to provide information on the basis for setting prices at that level and also visiting the premises. The issues were quickly resolved without the need for the Price Controller to exercise his power to fix the price of masks, thermometers and hand sanitizers. Across the Causeway, the government used powers under the equivalent of the PCA to fix the price of surgical masks.&nbsp;</p><p>By similarly having a permanent framework to deal with rent issues faced by the small businesses, we will be in effect making Singapore\\'s economy more resilient. This is because the Government of the day can leverage on legislation to ensure that these small businesses will not go belly up in the face of similar crises in future. Time is of essence in such situations. Significant business disruption to such small businesses can be irreversible.&nbsp;There will also be the salutary signalling effect within the business community, as we saw in the case of masks sellers who self-regulated after the Price Controller launched queries into their business conduct.</p><p>I do appreciate that the shape, form and impact of crises in future may be different. The help measures may also differ from crisis to crisis. However, this need not mean that a permanent piece of legislation would lose relevance. However different the crises may be, the impact on small businesses in form of cashflow and cost will largely remain. For clarity\\'s sake, the circumstances when Government\\'s powers to intervene in the rental market may be triggered must also be spelt out too. The legislation may be worded broadly to provide for a wide spectrum of measures that the Government may impose to help our small businesses as we saw in the PCA example. I respectfully suggest that the Emerging Stronger Task Force of the Future Economy Council consider my proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>My next point concerns the support under the Fortitude Budget provided to the charity sector. In my speech during the debate on the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets, I highlighted the fact that some charities, especially the smaller ones, already were facing dwindling donations.&nbsp;I recall the hon Member, Mr Saktiandi also made the same point. However, we differed in the approach to be taken to deal with this problem. The hon Member, Mr Saktiandi suggested that the Government support the charities; I felt chary about this suggestion because of the Budget deficit we face this year and the fact that we are drawing on past reserves.&nbsp;</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng\\'s approach in providing dollar-for-dollar matching addresses both concerns. It incentivises donations and the same time provides much needed support to charitable organisations in the essential service or providing the vulnerable a helping hand. In principle, I support the move.&nbsp;</p><p>In my respectful view, however, the dollar-for-dollar matching should be combined with an outcome driven approach so as to incentivise charity organisations to collaborate and delivery quality programmes for Singaporeans in need.&nbsp;Under this approach, there would be need for an analysis on the impact of the charitable programmes on the beneficiaries such that the more impactful programmes should be provided with more public funding. There should be also financial incentives for charities to collaborate, pool resources and scale up.&nbsp;</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng had noted that many individuals and organisations have stepped up to his call to help Singaporeans in need. With the increased number of charitable funds and individuals wanting to do charity work, there is an opportunity get charitable organisations with similar ideals and objectives to work together to ensure that the dollar provided by our Government is better spent.</p><p>It may well be that our Government will have to deepen its capability to play the role of matchmaker in encouraging charitable organisations to work together.&nbsp;This will, in my view, accelerate the transformation of the charity sector so that it will emerge stronger from this crisis to serve Singaporeans in need.</p><p>I now turn to my final point.&nbsp;Our Government has taken decisive steps to ensure that banks better support individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;What I fear though is that if the economy dwindles even further, more families, especially middle-income families who are not the primary targets of the care and support package,&nbsp;will find themselves more cash strapped. We all recognise that there is a limit to payments such as the Solidarity Payment or the Temporary Relief Fund that the Government may make. Such amounts may not be even sufficient.</p><p>Cash strapped middle income families may be living in HDB or private properties. For these asset-rich, cash-poor families, I wonder if the Government could consider nudging the financial institutions to provide hassle-free, low-interest home equity loan facilities secured by either (a) refinancing of the original mortgage facilities if the original mortgagee is a bank; or (b) by a second mortgage on their homes.</p><p>To my understanding, such options are not currently available for HDB flats. Traditionally, financial institutions are chary about being second mortgagees as, priority-wise,&nbsp;they rank below CPF and the first mortgagee. Also, the processing time can be long. The administration costs in terms of getting valuation and to draw up legal paperwork can be significant too.&nbsp;</p><p>I appreciate that this measure has to be carefully studied for its social impact because if families default on their obligations, the banks may have to foreclose on their homes. However, I think that this issue may be addressed by proper analysis and implementing safeguards on the part of banks.</p><p>Sir, my comments notwithstanding, I support the Fortitude Budget.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Dennis Tan.</p><h6>1.02 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought huge disruptions to global businesses and lives of people from virtually every country in the world. We are in arguably one of the most uncertain times in the history of mankind. No single government has been able to claim from the start they know how to navigate through the challenges posed by COVID-19 and the consequences it has brought to countries, cities, societies and economies.</p><p>Our Government of 55 years since our Independence is no exception. To that, we have an unprecedented four Budgets in a short period of less than four months.</p><p>Like everywhere else, the disruptions brought on by COVID-19 have unsettled businesses, lives and governments. This is a sign of things to come in the world, where no government can claim that their past experience will provide useful relevance for the uncertain future.&nbsp;In this brave new world, many heads with different ideas working out consensual solutions for the common good must be preferred.</p><p>I will start on the issue of support for businesses.</p><p>In the past two months, under the circuit breaker period, businesses have received support under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), limited to 75% or up to $4,600 of every salary. Under this Fortitude Budget, for the months ahead, only selected industries such as listed in Tiers 1 and 2 of the JSS will continue to receive wage supplements of up to 75% of each worker\\'s salary. For most businesses, they will only be receiving up to 25% of the first $4,600 of every worker\\'s salary for the remaining payments under the JSS, and this Fortitude Budget will only bring one additional month\\'s payment, limited to 25% of an employee\\'s salary.</p><p>As most businesses stop receiving the 75% wage support coming out from the circuit breaker period, we may start to see a more accurate picture of businesses suffering and insolvency figures for companies rising later this year.</p><p>The Government has announced that it will provide a cash grant to offset rental costs of SME tenants and also pass a new law to ensure landlords pass on rental support from the Government. This will be welcomed as a small temporary relief of 0.64 of a month\\'s rental for office and industrial properties and 0.8 of a month\\'s rental for commercial properties. Unfortunately, to businesses who cannot open or operate or even for businesses who face a significant drop in their businesses at this time, it may not stave off business and cost pressures in a significant way. In effect, it will be too small an amount to save ailing businesses.</p><p>Perhaps the assistance by way of JSS and rental support could have been more targeted and not applied to businesses who may not be affected, for example, supermarkets or certain businesses in healthcare, pharmaceutical or IT sectors, just to name a few. In this way, more will be available to the businesses who need them. We should not rely on unaffected businesses to voluntarily return their payouts.</p><p>The announced support in the Fortitude Budget for digital transformation whether for purpose of boosting e-payments or the digital resilience bonus may help to promote e-payments and to allow safe management practices in COVID-19 settings. While they may assist with business continuity under unique COVID-19 operating conditions, these schemes may be less helpful in generating business or revenue in themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>The financing support for promising start-ups under the Fortitude Budget may help some new start-ups but are probably irrelevant to the bulk of our existing SME businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond the above-mentioned schemes, beyond the foreign work levy waivers and rebates announced in this Fortitude Budget, beyond the assistance from credit loans announced in previous budgets, I am concerned that many SME businesses will still require more assistance if we are to expect them to survive. What are the Government\\'s plans to support them to tide through the months or year ahead beyond what has been announced under the Fortitude Budget?&nbsp;</p><p>Has the Government factored in any actual draft plans in arriving at the additional $13 billion Contingencies Funds asked for in this Fortitude Budget and if so, whether it can now share such plans with Singaporeans too?</p><p>I next move on to the challenges during the circuit breaker and the issue of letting businesses open up with less restrictions.</p><p>The circuit breaker has not been an easy period for many businesses and individuals. Some businesses are baffled why similar businesses did not always result in the same exemptions or the same manpower allocation ratios. Instructions have changed over the weeks for some businesses ranging from meal arrangements for hawkers to types of businesses allowed to be opened or types of merchandise allowed to be sold.</p><p>In the first few weeks of the circuit breaker, provision shops and minimarts in different Hougang precincts were given different directions. Some were told they were only allowed to sell food. Some were told that they were not allowed to sell mops, brooms, brushes, pails, cleaning liquids, even slippers and limited stationery. Some were allowed to sell with no restrictions. Operators were baffled as some of these items have been sold in NTUC FairPrice without restrictions. Thankfully, after the Hougang Member of Parliament sought clarifications, the authorities reached out and rectified the instructions given.</p><p>In the circuit breaker period, most businesses were required to stop operating in their premises and most employees could not work in their working premises and had to stay at home. Those who could still do some or all of their work at home were the lucky few ones as for many jobs and many businesses, telecommuting is either not an option at all or not an adequate option for a variety of reasons. Many businesses have been looking forward to the resumption of operations in their premises. Yet, it has been somewhat confusing and uncertain for many business owners whose businesses were supposedly cleared for resumption.</p><p>Minister Chan Chun Sing was reported in the media on 19 May to have said as follows, \"Only those who require the use of machinery and specialised terminals or need to complete legal documentation will be able to return to their workplaces. Workers who need infrequent access to the workplace for information or materials can already do so on an existing time-based exemption... The rest of the workers will continue to work from home. This will allow more than three-quarters of our economy to resume their normal operations.\"</p><p>These caveats are a challenge to viable resumption for many businesses. To continue with telecommuting per se may not be a viable option for many as telecommuting may suit certain positions but not others, and viable work that is required to be carried out in the office and unsuitability for telecommuting goes beyond the over-simplified description of merely requiring \"the use of machinery and specialised terminals or need to complete legal documentation\", especially bearing in mind many businesses will as I have highlighted earlier see their wage support under the JSS reduced to 25% from June onwards.</p><p>Productivity is another area of concern.&nbsp;The Government can be less prescriptive in this area, including any current limitation in the number of workers allowed in the workplace.&nbsp;Let businesses take ownership in managing telecommuting and the extent of telecommuting as appropriate for each individual business and their bottom line. Where any of these employees are required to be in the office or for workers where telecommuting has limited&nbsp;application, the Government can leave the onus on businesses to carry out prescribed safe workplace practices, including having appropriate social distancing and safe seating arrangements, use of SafeEntry,&nbsp;keeping records of staff and visitors to premises, including temperature records and good cleaning practices.&nbsp;</p><p>Let businesses focus on recovery with more breathing space. I am sure that most businesses will understand that their business operations are subject to closure due to failure in social distancing and safe workplace arrangements or in the event of an actual infection and most will take the necessary protective steps accordingly.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, next, I would like to seek an update from the Minister for Manpower in the number of foreign workers who are still currently not allowed to leave their dormitories to go to work.&nbsp;Further, is the Minister able to give a projected estimation of the number of these workers who will be released back to work in each of the next two to three months?&nbsp;</p><p>I am asking these questions because pending a review of our labour policies in the near future&nbsp;– perhaps after the COVID-19 crisis, particularly on our current unhealthy level of reliance on cheap foreign labour and also the way we house them, in the meantime, we need these workers to be back helping to restart our economy and also at the end of the day, the workers do not ordinarily live and work outside of Singapore and they are part of our community.</p><p>I am also asking these questions because it touches on how confident the Government is in bringing down infection in the foreign worker dormitories to zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I want to touch on safe connectivity with the world. Last Friday, the Government announced plans to launch \"fast lane\" arrangement with COVID-19 measures for essential business, official air travel between Singapore and China in early June, starting with six Chinese cities. Prior to that, the Government had also announced that there will be talks to reopen borders with New Zealand.&nbsp;</p><p>Quite understandably, we cannot stay unconnected for too long and the opening up of air travel and connection with these and, indeed, other countries will be beneficial to our businesses and economy.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, we have had recent experience of significant COVID-19 infections brought about by arriving passengers from abroad, first with the Wuhan tourists in January bringing the first recorded cases and transmissions to Singapore and then later on with some of those returning to Singapore or visitors from abroad around the period of March and April.</p><p>For the Government\\'s plans to open up air travel in the coming months even with selected countries and pending the eventual introduction of a vaccine for COVID-19, I hope that all necessary measures will be taken to ensure that the reopening will not lead to a resurgence of imported COVID-19 cases.</p><p>It has been reported that passengers will not be required to serve the 14-days quarantine period and they will be required to undertake swab tests before boarding and after arrival in Singapore.&nbsp;If swab tests are required before boarding a flight to Singapore, how do we ensure all overseas swab test results provided are reliable? For swab tests done on arrival, how will the Government ensure that pending the outcome of the testing, there will not be any risk to any persons with whom the passengers come into contact at the airport, at their selected accommodation and also while being transported to their accommodation? Are there any restrictions on their accommodation for this initial period?</p><p>Next, on safe travel on public transport.&nbsp;Minister Khaw Boon Wan announced on Monday that rail and bus services will return to pre-circuit breaker levels but indicated that safe social distancing may not be possible.&nbsp;This is disconcerting. Besides being a potential Achilles\\' heel in our fight against COVID-19, it is inconsistent with social distancing efforts that were carried out previously on trains during the circuit breaker. It is also inconsistent with the stringent enforcement efforts adopted in many other situations with regards to social distancing, for which many people have been fined or given warnings for breaches and the rationale for such enforcement.</p><p>Finally, President Halimah Yacob was reported to have stated her support for this Fortitude Budget.&nbsp;I wonder whether the President, in arriving at her conclusion to support the draw of $31 billion from our reserves as well as the previous draws from reserves under the previous Budgets, had already been advised of the total amount of reserves Singapore has and had taken this into consideration. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-Dennis Tan Fortitude 5June2020-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mr Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;we may start to see the number of business failures going up in the next few months, leading to more job losses. After May, most businesses will receive 25% wage support and the Fortitude Budget will only increase support by one more month of such wage support. I would like to ask the Minister to extend more support to our SME businesses especially those who are struggling.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I also hope that the Government will extend more flexibility to businesses who are cleared to resume business on their premises, to manage their businesses as they see fit as long as they comply with safe distancing and other safe workplace practices as required by the Government.</p><p>&nbsp;As for the Government’s plans to resume airlinks with China and New Zealand, it is important to resume connection for the benefit of our economy. However, I hope the Government will take all necessary measures to ensure that we will avoid another wave of foreign imported COVID-19 infections.</p><p>As more rail and bus services are resumed in phase 1, 2 and 3, I also hope that the Government take all necessary measures for safe travel and social distancing especially during peak hours. The relaxation of social distancing in our trains since Tuesday is a huge concern. Lack of social distancing on public transport is inconsistent with the authorities’ stringent enforcement efforts in social distancing elsewhere, not to mention a potential Achilles heel in our fight against COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, President Halimah Yacob was reported to have stated her support for this Fortitude Budget. I wonder whether the President, in arriving at her conclusion to support the draw of $31 billion from our reserves as well as the previous draws from reserves under the Solidarity and Resilience Budgets, had already been advised of the total amount of reserves Singapore has and had taken this into consideration.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Terence Ho.</p><h6>1.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I thank Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his team for always having arts in his heart and making arts possible and vibrant, even during this COVID-19 situation. I also want to thank the colleagues in MCCY and the National Arts Council (NAC) for their dedication and commitment to keep arts going strong. They work tirelessly to render support in this difficult period.</p><p>As at 22 May 2020, NAC has supported more than 850 artists and arts groups, funded more than 60 digitalisation projects and reached over 6.2 million online views.&nbsp;If we take into consideration of the other online digital programmes by the arts groups, we should reach more than 10 million online viewers as today. Singapore Chinese Orchestra\\'s digital efforts has seen six series, more than 130 contents uploaded, and a total of more than one million viewership to-date. Singapore Symphony Orchestra\\'s SSOPlayOn! series, the Siong Leng Musical Association and the Nam Hwa Opera have brought their art onto several social media platforms for all to enjoy. The theatre groups live-stream their performances and the Esplanade partners with SISTIC to provide pay-per-view tickets to achieve self-sustained model for online performances.</p><p>In these difficult times, we need the arts and culture to uplift our spirits. I hope the artists and arts groups can tap on the Fortitude Budget to sustain works, spread positivity and make arts as an essential for everyone in the new normalcy. They can explore and tap on the Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme, SEP Income Relief Scheme, COVID-19 Support Grant and the Arts and Culture Resilience Package (ACRP). The $55 million ACRP seeks to protect the arts and culture eco-system and will provide support and opportunities for our cultural organisations and practitioners until the end of the year, while encouraging the development of longer-term capabilities that will help the community emerge stronger after COVID-19.</p><p>I have four suggestions. One, cultivate concert virtual exposure acquired by the expanding digital consumers of arts to actual engagement. Two, capability building should revamp and remodel in the strategic marketing area to bring headcounts for the various arts form, especially for ticketed events. Three, digital culture pass to encourage pay-per-view digital concert and even purchasing of live concert tickets when we allow concert to be staged at the concert hall. Four, more can be done to commission and collaborate with the private and public sector to utilise collective resources for the arts presentation in a more effective way.</p><p>Arts are the engines of togetherness and collective sense-making. A lost in cultural eco-system would be harder to re-cultivate than to restore anything.&nbsp;In Mandarin, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-Terence Ho Fortitude 5June2020 -Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his team for always having the livelihood of artists and arts group in their heart. The Government pays great attention to the arts and the cultural sector, making arts an indispensable spiritual nourishment during the outbreak.&nbsp;</p><p>NAC and Lianhe Zaobao worked together to launch the Zaobao Recital Series comprising four online programmes, including Chinese music, vocals, classical chamber music and literature reciting. Netizens have responded warmly to these online programmes.</p><p>The enhanced Job Support Scheme has enabled many art groups and artists to maintain their livelihood during the outbreak and continue to create artworks and surprises, so that people can continue to enjoy arts performances online. For example, Singapore Chinese Orchestra staged the Tutti Singapore percussion performance; Singapore Symphony Orchestra uploaded SSOPlayOn! series, and Singapore Chinese Music Federation gathered 30 Erhu players to present a performance called \"Towards a Brighter Future\" in celebration of the 30th anniversary of Singapore-China diplomatic ties. Dingyi Music Company, Siong Leng Musical Association, Nan Hwa Opera and the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre have also created many online stay-home performances. They use advanced digital technologies to bring arts onto various social media platforms, so that their audiences can enjoy wonderful concerts and performances free at home. There are more than 10 million online viewership to-date.</p><p>During this period, many enthusiastic supporters are paying special attention to the vulnerable groups by giving them donations and support. This is good. I feel that freelancers in the arts and cultural sector will need our help too. The existence of our local arts and cultural community is the spirit and hope of the society. This group of people will not be the first to come to people\\'s mind to help. Their livelihood is not easy in the first place, and made worse by the outbreak. The support they received is far from enough, and this reflects the fundamental cultural attitude of a society. In this regard, we need a wider definition of arts and broader arts recognition among our people, so that more people are willing to support and promote arts and spread its values.</p><p>I hope that artists and arts groups can make good use of the funding and grants in these difficult times, move on with fortitude and continue to innovate and create. I believe that the community will emerge stronger and more united after COVID-19. The development of arts and culture would also be different from before. We will need new engines and new concepts to create a new world. I hope we can bring online audiences to concert halls and theatres. After artists have returned to the stage, I believe they will be able to create more inspiring programmes. This is because arts can provide spiritual nourishments, lift people\\'s mood and warm their hearts. We will definitely conquer COVID-19, start a new life accompanied by beautiful music and artistic creations, and unite as one people to march towards prosperity and progress.&nbsp;</p><p>I support the Fortitude Budget.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><p>(<em>In English</em>): I am in support of the Fortitude Budget.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leon Perera.</p><h6>1.26 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, across the world, governments, healthcare systems, companies, societies and families have been severely tested by a microscopic virus. We will continue to be tested. We will need to meet these tests as one united people, united by our love for our country and one another</p><p>Looking back, for me, the past two months have been extraordinary, working with Party colleagues and volunteers to provide support to residents remotely, adapting corporate processes to work from home and making adjustments to family life with my two young children, aged 12 and 14, going through home-based learning.</p><p>Now, our attention turns to the process of recovery. It is appropriate that an Emerging Stronger Task Force has been formed. I agree with the remarks made by my Party Chairman Ms Sylvia Lim on the composition and work of that task force.</p><p>As a society, it is our collective responsibility to reflect, draw the right lessons and emerge stronger. After all, the world went through the cataclysm of the Spanish flu in 1918 but many lessons about preventing and controlling pandemics were not permanently and widely institutionalised after that trauma.</p><p>We have a choice. Will we emerge stronger? What can we learn from this episode for this post-circuit breaker period and the post COVID-19 future that Singapore will emerge into?</p><p>I would like to speak about two areas&nbsp;– overall pandemic management and the economy.</p><p>At the start of the pandemic, the Government quickly formed a whole-of-Government task force and issued regular communications. The challenge facing this task force was gargantuan. Our knowledge of COVID-19 was imperfect and evolving. There were many moving parts. In hindsight, though, many Singaporeans, looking back on the rules and announcements issued since early April, would say that there were too many finely calibrated rules. These were often qualified or changed shortly after being announced and this led to confusion on the ground. Let me cite a few examples.</p><p>On 21 April, when the tighter circuit breaker measures were announced, the press release said outlet-based confectionery operations had to be suspended from 2359 hours on 21 April, but those selling mainly bread could continue. What followed was some confusion as those selling mainly cakes try to find out what they could do. It was clarified that they could sell their inventory of cakes but not bake new ones. Some bakeries, such as one making mainly croissants, had to clarify how the rules apply to them.</p><p>Car workshops were another example. Initially, when the circuit breaker was announced, motor workshops were told they could apply to stay open but only for emergency services. A Straits Times\\' report from 7 April said that motor workshop operators were confused initially by the phrase \"emergency vehicle services\" found in the GoBusiness COVID-19 site. Do they mean emergency vehicles like ambulances or do they mean emergency services for vehicles, one asked.</p><p>Another example, in late April it was announced that exercising and dog walking were not permitted within the common areas of condominiums. One letter writer to TODAY on the 30 April mentioned that \"to access public spaces, dogs would have to traverse the common condominium grounds thus rendering the rule moot in practice.\" Such a rule may also have had the effect of condominium dog owners then crowding in adjacent pathways by the road, HDB or landed common areas or parks.</p><p>The intent behind these finely calibrated and frequently revised rules was good. But in hindsight, could the technocratic zeal have been tempered by an appreciation that the capacity of society to adapt to so many frequently changing rules is not unlimited, while the capacity of any civil service to issue so many detailed and finely calibrated rules in a very short time is limited.</p><p>Too frequent and unclear rules can lead to rules fatigue and cynicism towards rule compliance.&nbsp;Moreover, would it not have been more efficient for the exceptions and caveats to rules to have been announced at the same time as the rule. And could some rules that micro-manage what are permissible activities have been avoided in favour of making facility owners responsible for safe distancing, masking and so on?</p><p>Sir, my colleague Mr Dennis Tan has also made some suggestions on the roll-out of Phase One, with which I agree. I would add one point. The Government\\'s approach to Phase One and beyond hinges on demarcating companies into either an essential or non-essential category for each phase. So, for example, in Phase One most retail, cinemas, bars, restaurants, event-based activities and tuition centres remain shut. This is in spite of the fact that crowds and lack of safe distancing have been anecdotally observed in a number of supermarket outlets and shopping malls under current rules, and that safe distancing is no longer mandatory on public transport.</p><p>&nbsp;We need to find the right balance between protecting livelihoods and protecting lives.&nbsp;Has the Government considered an alternative approach which is to calibrate this a little less finely and with a broader brush. This means allowing most establishments to open may be with the exception of those which pose the most extreme risk. But every establishment would be tasked to practise safe distancing, masking and other precautions. This would mean that some establishments would, perhaps, not be able to optimise capacity to economically viable levels. But should we not that choice to business owners? Some business owners may prefer to restart with reduced capacity so as to generate some cashflow, refresh connections with customers, start to rotate staff back to work for the sake of morale and skills refreshing and so on.&nbsp;For those industries where the risk is greater, these should be targeted for more enforcement and regular preventive COVID-19 testing.</p><p>In fact, the administration of rapid testing and swift isolation in a surgical manner, as opposed to only very severe lockdowns, has been seen as a key to Korea\\'s success, which brings me to my next point on testing.</p><p>Sir, our current main form of testing appears to be the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or RTPCR test. Some challenges of scaling up the current PCR test are that testing takes about three hours for results to be obtained. Laboratory staff operating the extractors must also wear personal protective equipment or PPE and most countries looking to exit lockdown have similar mass testing strategies&nbsp;– increasing demand for the same reagents and PPE.</p><p>MOH has said that coronavirus test were conducted by 13 laboratories in Singapore, the majority of which are located at public healthcare institutions such as hospitals. There are private sector industrial testing labs that offer testing of COVID-19 on surfaces, not patient swabs. It is not clear if these labs currently also offer testing of human samples since this is not advertised. It would be good to know if these industrial labs can be co-opted to help with our testing.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the challenges in scaling up the PCR testing method, there is a need to concurrently explore scaling up of other testing methods to be able to roll out effective mass testing. The Tony Blair Institute in the UK has called for antibody tests to be more widely used in conjunction with the PCR test, even if it is less accurate. Could such antibody tests together with the current PCR test be used to triage testing of suspected cases to take the load off the PCR testing infrastructure.</p><p>Next, Sir, a number of new schemes have been rolled out. For example, there is a $100 utilities rebate in this latest Fortitude Budget&nbsp;– $100. Previously, SIRS and JSS were rolled out. Before COVID-19 there were also many schemes. To cite some random examples&nbsp;– Workfare, Jobs Credit, Innovation Credit and SkillsFuture. Some schemes are automatically applied and money gets transferred into&nbsp;your bank account. That is it. Some schemes you have to apply for to get the money or support. For other schemes, the money exists in an account tagged to each citizen and you have to use it.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, the more schemes we have, the more there is risk of confusion leading to under-utilisation or other side effects. Also, the more complex the whole system becomes the more resources need to go into the work of explaining, sifting through and helping people or firms to apply for these schemes. Social workers and Family Service Centres and officers at economic agencies like Enterprise Singapore, for example, would have to meet this challenge by mastering all the minutiae of the schemes and then explaining them well.</p><p>Sir, there are just too many schemes with distinct names and processes right now.</p><p>Would the Government consider a unified portal across the whole-of-Government where each citizen and company can log on, view and transact? Such a portal would show firstly, that the monies that have been credited from all schemes that automatically kick in; two, the schemes which that person or company is eligible to apply for; or where there is imperfect information where they may be eligible to apply for for those that need application with direct links to the application forms from respective Ministries, Statutory Boards and agencies; and thirdly, the money that has been credited to them in special accounts but which needs to be utilised by a certain date.</p><p>The existence of such a portal would be a first step. The next step would be to streamline the schemes and curb the tendency to launch new schemes but attempt instead to channel support into existing schemes. Sir, sometimes less is more. And in saying this, for the elderly who are less IT-savvy, arrangements need to be made to facilitate their access to such a portal.</p><p>Next, let me move to the economy. Minister Chan recently announced $13 billion in foreign direct investment commitments in the first four months of this year versus $15.2 billion for the whole of last year. This is good news indeed.</p><p>I would like to ask MTI how much of this $13 billion is fixed asset investment versus total business spending. How many jobs is this expected to be translated into? And what incentives were used to secure these investments?</p><p>It is important to continue to attract FDI and to refine and improve our strategies for doing so. But the economic challenge of developing home-grown entrepreneurship and our own world-beating companies is going to be greater than ever. World trade growth was already slowing own even before COVID-19. COVID-19 will not put in an end to FDI for sure. But it is likely to result in more competition for perhaps less FDI, as some multi-national companies or MNCs migrate some operations back home and other MNCs try to diversify to less traditional FDI destinations, responding to the imperatives of supply chain resilience, political pressures and other imperatives.</p><p>Sir, our GDP growth rate was a weak 0.7% in 2019 before COVID-19 and that 0.7% growth rate was one of the lowest rates of growth among major advanced economies in the world in that year. No doubt there are many schemes and programmes to stimulate entrepreneurship. Have these met with the desired results? Are we where we want to be?</p><p>In this House my colleagues and I have mooted a number of ideas on this front in the past. For example, setting up a fund to support ex-civil servants who want to become entrepreneurs and demonstrating more flexibility in schemes based on results.</p><p>Sir, NASA recently launched its first vehicle into space using private sector launch capacity provided by the company Space X. Uplifting our entrepreneurial sector is going to be a key national competitiveness challenge facing Singapore. I would argue for renewed soul searching and efforts on this front as an urgent priority. Mr Speaker, Sir, in Malay, please.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-5 June 2020 - Mr Leon Perera - Debate on DPM Statement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>The Government\\'s approach to Phase One and beyond hinges on the demarcation of companies into either an essential or non-essential category for each phase. This is in spite of the fact that crowds have been observed to continue visiting a number of supermarkets in shopping centres and are not really practising safe distancing under current rules. Has the Government considered an alternative approach, which is to calibrate this a little less finely, but in a broader manner instead? This means allowing most businesses to open, perhaps with the exception of those which may pose the most extreme risks. At the same time, every business should be required to practise safe distancing, the wearing of masks and all other precautions. And for those industries where the risk is greater, these should be targeted for more enforcement and regular, preventive COVID-19 testing.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Speaker, Sir, has COVID-19 shown that our model of economics and politics is perfect? No. Neither is any countries\\'. The success achieved by other developed countries in the region against COVID-19 such as Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and New Zealand should give us pause that we, too, have things to learn.</p><p>For example, if stronger independent voices had come out to say the precautionary reusable mask wearing was okay in the early days, it may have cut down on some asymptomatic transmission.</p><p>Last year, I read an excellent book called \"The Narrow Corridor\" by academics Daron Acemoglu&nbsp;and James Robinson. It uses extensive historical research spanning centuries to argue that the most successful societies are those that find the right balance between a strong, capable state and an equally strong non-state sector&nbsp;–&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">meaning civil society, alternative parties and the private sector </span>–&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">to balance that state. The outcomes of such successful societies are able to obtain combined political stability and law and order on the one hand together with long-term innovation-driven economic development and social progress on the other hand.</span></p><p>And so, in conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, at the end of this speech, I find myself returning to a theme in my very first speech in this House given in January 2016&nbsp;– the Singapore glass is half full. Singaporeans bear a major two-fold responsibility to preserve what is good about our existing system but to change what should be changed to make it better.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad.</p><h6>1.45 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker.&nbsp;“Your every day is full of sunshine.&nbsp;But into every life, a little rain must fall” – prose from a song by the legendary rock band, Queen.</p><p>We are living in very challenging times, with unpredictable weather ahead. They say that in every crisis, lies opportunity. Therefore, we should make the best of every opportunity available, no matter how strong the headwinds are. And this is why the Government and our tripartite partners are making every effort to create an umbrella of opportunities to weather the storm.&nbsp;</p><p>I will speak about how our workers and employers can tap on the opportunities and support available. We will help workers be flexible, to adapt and to widen their skills. We will also provide support for employers to make use of their downtime to upskill their workforce for transformed jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>The Minister for Manpower has elaborated on the strong Government support for our workers and I will focus on how fresh graduates and our mature workers can tap on opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Our fresh graduates are entering the job market amidst great uncertainty. I can personally relate to the anxiety of many of our fresh graduates who may be concerned with their job prospects. I graduated in 1999, shortly after the Asian Financial Crisis. There were few jobs and even fewer interviews. But I would like to assure our fresh graduates and their parents, compared to them, we are now more prepared and better resourced to support our fresh graduates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the current economic conditions, there are still jobs available in some areas. We will support employers to take in and groom new hires, including through sector-specific programmes such as the Company-Led Training Programme for Infocomm and Technology jobs. Some may not be able to find employment in this tough job market, and this is why we launched the SGUnited Traineeships programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have more than doubled our initial goal from up to 8,000 traineeships to up to 21,000 traineeships. Our graduates can look forward to traineeships in sectors with good growth prospects such as Financial Services, Professional Services and Infocomm Technology and Media sectors.</p><p>There are familiar roles in Marketing and Finance too, and more specialised ones such as Sports Nutrition and Social Work. Graduates can check out available traineeships on MyCareersFuture.sg by searching for the hashtag #SGUnitedTraineeships.&nbsp;</p><p>On this note, I would like to thank the Singapore Business Federation for helping to vet and approve the large volume of traineeship proposals from companies. I would also like to acknowledge the many employers that have opened their doors to trainees. An example is Yang Kee Logistics, who will be offering traineeship opportunities in software development and food supply chain management.&nbsp;</p><p>Two trainees will support the Logistics Integrated Transport Ecosystem project, a cloud-based platform that connects logistics industry stakeholders and multiple intermediaries. They will be able to sharpen their software development skills and gain deeper project management skills. Another trainee will be exposed to Yang Kee\\'s new food logistics business arm as a sales support coordinator. These traineeship experiences will be meaningful and valuable, providing them skills that are in-demand and hands-on industry experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Traineeships help our fresh graduates to build their experience and skills. This puts the trainee in good stead to find a job, either with the host company or elsewhere in the sector. To give our trainees a further boost, employers that hire them will receive the enhanced Hiring Incentive, with salary support of 20% of monthly salary for six months, capped at $6,000 in total.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government will work with employers to provide as many jobs and traineeships as possible. As many opportunities are likely to come from firms in growth sectors, I encourage our graduates to keep an open mind and consider how skills acquired in school can be applied to different careers.</p><p>We are also paying close attention to our mature workers. Many of them may have been in the same occupation for a long time, and find it more challenging to make a career switch. As Mr Patrick Tay mentioned, we need to support our mid-career workers and we also need to help them access the opportunities available. How can mature workers do so?</p><p>First, do consider making the switch into a new career. I recognise that it is not easy, but you are not alone. Workforce Singapore\\'s Professional Conversion Programmes, or PCP, have helped nearly 14,500 Singaporeans since 2016 to successfully switch to new careers. The results are encouraging. About nine in 10 remain in employment for two years after getting a job, and seven in 10 earned higher wages. Clearly, the PCP has been effective in preparing our workers for new careers.</p><p>The Government provides up to 90% of salary support and course fees subsidies to encourage employers to hire mature workers through these programmes. We are also ramping up our capacity to provide more programmes.</p><p>One example is 55-year-old Choa Wai Sim – one individual who successfully made the switch. She previously worked in a traditional sales role performing tasks such as quality control and quotation of sales. While she initially applied for a salesperson role at Aries Fresh Private Limited, she was open to take on a different role focusing on digital sales offered by Aries Fresh in March this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to PCP for Digital Sales Executives, Wai Sim gained digital skills which complements her sales experience. I personally found it inspiring that Wai Sim has transformed her 30 plus years of experience to take on the digital world as well. She now uses Facebook and Google Ads to generate leads and increase sales. Wai Sim is earning 30% more, compared to her previous traditional sales role. She is an encouraging role model for all of us and I would like to thank Aries Fresh for investing in our mature workers and I hope that many others would consider this too.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, mature jobseekers can also consider taking part in the new SGUnited Traineeships for mid-career workers, which will be named SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme. This programme will provide mid-career workers with company attachment opportunities to pick up industry-relevant skills and broaden their professional circles. This will boost their employability when the economy recovers.&nbsp;</p><p>We aim to provide up to 4,000 of such attachment opportunities. Compared to the SGUnited Traineeships, mid-careerists on this SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme can expect to receive a higher stipend based on their relevant experience and skills that they bring to the host company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To encourage employers to hire mature workers who have gone through eligible programmes such as the SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme, we doubled the Hiring Incentive to 40% of monthly salary for six months, capped at $12,000 in total.&nbsp;</p><p>Our employers play an important role in growing our economy and hiring our workers. It is important that we also guide them through this storm. Even when employers are in \"survival mode\", their odds of survival will improve with a more skilled and productive workforce. I would like to encourage employers to take a longer-term view and walk with their workers through these challenging times.</p><p>Different employers are affected in different ways by this unprecedented crisis. The first group of employers are those who are not so badly affected and are still growing. And we encourage these employers to consider jobseekers who may not have all the skills needed to perform the job, but can do it with some training.</p><p>To support such employers, we will be ramping up the capacity of our career conversion programmes to more than 14,000 places this year. So, taken together with the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and the enhanced Hiring Incentive, the out-of-pocket costs of employers for hiring and training new workers are significantly reduced.</p><p>For others who are cautious about hiring, do consider the traineeship programmes. I encourage you to offer as many positions as you can. Not only will you benefit from the additional manpower to meet your business needs, you will also help trainees pick up useful skills and work experience.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government will also subsidise the costs of providing these traineeship opportunities by funding 80% of the traineeship stipends. Employers only need to fund the remaining 20%. Host companies can indicate their interest at the SGUnited Traineeships page on WSG\\'s website.</p><p>Many employers may face short-term difficulties. We fully understand. Member of Parliament Patrick Tay expressed concerns about unfair practices on the ground, and I share his concerns. While it may not be easy, employers should be fair to their workers during hard times. The Government has provided significant wage support under the JSS to offset and protect local employees\\' wages. Employers should act responsibly and fairly. Those who put local employees on mandatory no-pay-leave or retrench them will not be entitled to the enhanced JSS pay-outs for those employees.</p><p>The updated Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment and National Wage Council\\'s guidelines issued in end-March provides guidance on managing excess manpower responsibly. Where there is a need to reduce wages, managements should lead by example, and seek the consent of the unions and engage employees.</p><p>Employers should take the lead to help their workers reskill and support business transformation plans. Employees have often been worried about training while working. For some, it is whether they can find time to go for training without disadvantaging themselves at work. Others may find it difficult to identify relevant training to improve their career prospects.&nbsp;</p><p>Employers should come in to provide guidance. They are best placed to identify relevant skills required for their business transformation strategies. It is also a good opportunity to send workers who would have not otherwise have gone for training to reskill. Moreover, employers can reskill their existing workers at a low cost by tapping on Government support.&nbsp;</p><p>Employers can send existing workers to participate in job redesign programmes, a type of PCP to help existing employees take on new roles or redesigned job roles in the same company. Many employers think that PCPs are for workers to transit to new sectors, but there are also PCP programmes that employers can adopt in their companies. And the Government provides up to 90% salary support and course fee subsidies.</p><p>All Watches Private Limited is an employer that is reskilling their workers for enhanced job roles to support their digital transformation plans. They are ramping up its online e-commerce platform given the shift in consumer behaviour and increase in demand for e-commerce. Through WSG\\'s Job Redesign Reskilling Programme for the Retail Industry, 11 workers are gaining relevant digital skills. For instance, their retail team leaders will gain skills to understand online and offline customer behaviour and to develop and implement offline-to-online strategies in enhanced Customer Service Leader roles.</p><p>I encourage employers to consider this option. Not only would employers keep their workers at lower cost, their workers will emerge with new and relevant skills to support their business transformation and growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, before I conclude, let me address Mr Zainal Sapari\\'s points on lower wage workers, particularly those in essential services.&nbsp;</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted the importance of the work done by our essential workers, many of whom come under the Progressive Wage Model (PWM). For the majority of them, their workloads have increased during this period, and we applaud and appreciate their efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, this is an important group. MOM and our tripartite partners have been working hard to uplift this segment. To support our lower wage workers, we have recently enhanced Workfare to benefit more workers and also provided a special Workfare Special Payment (WSP) payout of $3,000 as a result of the COVID-19 situation. The first payout of $1,500 will be made in the next month, with the second payout of $1,500 in October 2020. In these times, it is imperative that we bolster support for our lower wage workers.</p><p>Mr Zainal co-chairs the tripartite committees to review and enhance the wage and skills ladders in sectors under the PWM today, so that our workers can enjoy better wages and be more productive. These efforts are complemented by the sectoral tripartite partners\\' implementation of the various industry transformation maps, such as in the security and environmental services sectors. These will leverage technology to raise our workers\\' productivity.&nbsp;</p><p>MOM is and will continue to give our fullest support to these important efforts.</p><p>Assoc Prof Walter Theseira said, and I quote, \"the unseen engine behind global cities worldwide is a vast army of essential workers, who are frequently paid too little to live next to those they provide services to\". I fully agree. As a society, we must uplift our lower wage workers and bridge inequality. I believe that our society has matured enough that we would not turn a blind eye to this group of workers, and recognise that they too, should be paid fairly for the essential work that they do. This is the right thing to do. But these efforts will not be able to come to fruition if we do not have the support of the wider community.</p><p>At the end of the day, all of us would have to contribute towards the higher pay for these workers by sharing the rise in cost of products and services.</p><p>The Progressive Wage Models (PWMs) have served us well in supporting our lower wage workers, which includes workers in essential sectors such as cleaning and security. Between 2013 and 2018, the real median monthly gross wages of full-time cleaners, security officers and landscape workers grew cumulatively by 30% or more, which is higher than the 16% for the median full-time income of resident workers. As Member Walter Theseira observed in his Budget speech in February, the PWMs have reversed formerly stagnant wage growth for lower income Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>The vision of PWM was to create occupation, wage and skills ladders across all sectors. This will support our workers to up-skill, raise their productivity and earn higher wages. Given the positive impact of the PWMs, MOM is committed to supporting our tripartite partners\\' efforts to extend PWM to more sectors.</p><p>Earlier this year, we announced that the tripartite partners are extending the PWM to escalator maintenance workers.&nbsp;Members of the community have also voiced their support for essential workers during COVID-19. During my speech at the Committee of Supply debates in March, I painted a vision of how the PWM should be a broader movement where the community can play a part as responsible consumers, even in sectors where mandatory PWM is not possible. In this way, companies that voluntarily pay progressive wages and provide job progression pathways to their workers are recognised and rewarded by consumers who support them by purchasing their goods or services. This will in turn spur more companies to be progressive as the best way to advance their business interests. MOM will share more details when the economic climate and business conditions are more favourable.</p><p>I would like to move on and address Members\\' points on the vulnerability of lower-wage essential workers. Ms Jessica Tan spoke about the need to pay attention to the working conditions as businesses resumed operations, especially for the essential and frontline workers.</p><p>COVID-19 has resulted in significant disruptions to the demand and supply of outsourced services by service buyers and providers. This has in turn affected the livelihoods of workers such as cleaners and security officers.&nbsp;</p><p>The tripartite partners have worked closely to issue tripartite advisories to guide service buyers and providers on how all stakeholders can navigate the situation together to ensure the sustainability of these industries and protect our workers\\' livelihoods. These advisories guide service providers in properly remunerating their workers and urge service buyers to exercise restraint when activating penalty clauses or liquidated damages.&nbsp;This helps ensure that workers are paid appropriately based on their workloads and that their employers have the cashflow to pay them accordingly.</p><p>Service buyers and providers are also encouraged to reallocate manpower based on their priorities. This helps to manage the employees\\' workloads. Finally, employers are also urged to seize the opportunity to up-skill their workers by tapping on Government support, which will prepare them for future challenges and opportunities. By adopting these recommendations, our lower wage essential workers will be protected and employers will be able to tide through this tough period together with them.</p><p>Beyond this, we are also maintaining our efforts to uplift the well-being of our lower wage workers at work through the Workcare initiative. As I shared earlier, we will be launching a new Workcare Grant later this year to support building owners and employers to provide rest areas for outsourced workers&nbsp;– this, with a view to eventually legislating this requirement. Given the importance of their work, it is only right that we promote a culture of care and provide them with the respect they deserve. I would like make a call for everyone to play a part in supporting our lower wage workers and improving their well-being at work – that even small gestures can be meaningful.</p><p>The Government will always look after our lower wage workers through our social schemes. Initiatives such as Workfare supplements their wages, the Enhanced Housing Grant ensures that they have a roof under which their families can grow in stable environments and ComCare provides meaningful social support. We hope that everyone can support us in uplifting our lower wage workers and caring for them in the way they deserve.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I began my speech with how, in every crisis, lies opportunity. We must make every opportunity count. The Government is committed to supporting both our jobseekers and employers to ride out this storm and to emerge stronger. We will help jobseekers seize every available opportunity and employers are encouraged to use this period to build up a skilled workforce so that they are well-positioned for recovery. We can achieve this by working together as Singapore United.</p><p>Mr Speaker, allow me to share a few key points on the Government\\'s support for employers and workers in Malay.&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-5 June 2020 - MOS Zaqy Mohd - Debate on DPM Statement (cred2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>We will support Singaporeans fully. There are many opportunities in growth sectors, so I encourage those who are seeking jobs to be flexible and willing to adapt to access these opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, there are conversion programmes to help you reskill to gain employment in new areas, including the SGUnited Traineeships Programme and the SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme. These programmes can help you to gain industry-relevant work experience and build professional networks.&nbsp;</p><p>We have also introduced measures to help businesses cope during this trying period. I urge employers to be fair and responsible to their workers. Retain your workers, and tap on Government support to help your workers upskill, and at the same time, help your company transform for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, I am greatly heartened to see my fellow Singaporeans and community organisations stepping up to collectively complement the Government’s efforts to help employers and workers during this difficult period. These include the wonderful efforts by our Malay/Muslim community.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the SGTeguhBersatu Taskforce, organisations such as MENDAKI SENSE and the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, or SMCCI, have stepped forward to further strengthen the last-mile delivery of national support measures and lead targeted initiatives to support the Malay/Muslim community on jobs, upskilling and digitalisation for businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>SENSE has organised three Virtual Career Fairs which have attracted close to 12,000 visitors. More than 3,400 people have submitted job applications and the total number of applications received have exceeded 8,000 applications. To date, the CariKerja app has received over 22,000 downloads. These figures indicate a good start.&nbsp;</p><p>SENSE will be scaling up their outreach efforts within the community, including to mature workers, fresh graduates as well as PMET jobseekers.</p><p>For our local businesses, SMCCI, together with technology partners such as Lalamove and Shopback, has helped their members to adopt new solutions that would optimise their businesses in areas such as marketing and e-payments. SMCCI will continue its efforts to conduct more capability development seminars so that our local businesses can make the move to innovate, transform and strengthen their resilience.</p><p>We can expect structural changes to the global and Singapore economy in the long term. As announced by Minister Masagos last week, I will be leading a new workgroup, comprising MENDAKI SENSE, SMCCI, NTUC, organisations from the public sector and community partners to support our Malay/Muslim workers.&nbsp;</p><p>This workgroup will support the efforts of the National Jobs Council, led by Senior Minister Tharman. Collectively, we want to build on the efforts of the SGTeguhBersatu Taskforce, to provide employment support for Malay/Muslim jobseekers, and to better prepare them and improve their employment prospects, by working with our partners and the Government. We will also strengthen our outreach efforts to prepare the community for the future of jobs. This includes mature workers, fresh graduates, the self-employed, and our asatizah.&nbsp;</p><p>We want to help our workers to upskill so that they can stay relevant and subsequently gain employment. With that, they will hopefully have better salary prospects. It is important for the Malay/Muslim community to be ready to seize any opportunities during this crisis and when the economy recovers.</p><p>Our path forward will be tough, but we will journey through it together. The Government will continue to support Singaporeans in adapting to new circumstances. With strong community support, we will work hand-in-hand to help workers and employers seize available opportunities, so that we will emerge stronger as one Singapore. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Pritam Singh</p><h6>2.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: Mr Speaker, when I spoke on the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets in April, my speech focused on the future. What would happen after the deployment of significant reserves to support lives and livelihoods? I also spoke about how COVID-19 had exposed inequalities&nbsp;– how the wages of some Singaporeans working in essential services need to go up&nbsp;– and what opportunities the COVID-19 crisis had engendered to reimagine a better Singapore.</p><p>For this Fortitude Budget debate, which once again calls for a draw on the reserves, I will focus on three \"E\"s&nbsp;– the economy, engagement and empathy.</p><p>First, the economy.&nbsp;While the central focus of this Budget was jobs, Deputy Prime Minister Heng\\'s speech was instructive in my view for the restatement of three hard truths in the coming months. First, Singapore can expect some tough times ahead. On the day the Deputy Prime Minister delivered this Budget, MTI announced a downward adjustment of our growth forecast of -1% to -4%, to -4% to -7%. Second, the Deputy Prime Minister reminded Singaporeans that life will not return to pre-COVID-19 days, with the global economy unlikely to recover quickly. Finally, the Deputy Prime Minister\\'s speech also reminded Singaporeans, \"that Government cannot carry businesses forever.\"</p><p>On the limit of Government being able to carry business forever, it is clear that companies and businesses will soon have to underwrite their employees\\' wages. This has hitherto been significantly supported by the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS).</p><p>With poor economic growth at the door, some business owners have shared with me that they have retained workers as long as they could, thanks to the JSS, even as other workers were emplaced on no-pay leave and have had to take pay cuts. As JSS expires in time, some retrenchments are inevitable.</p><p>To that end, the goal of the Government to accelerate digitalisation, up-skilling for the future and the creation of a National Jobs Council are steps in the right direction and supported by the Workers\\' Party.&nbsp;These initiatives cohere with an eye on the future and the transformation to a post COVID-19-ready Singapore economy.</p><p>On jobs, Mr Speaker, the headline numbers vis-a-vis initiatives like the new SGUnited Mid-Career Traineeships scheme of 4,000 openings may not appear large next to the size of the Singaporean workforce, but they are an important source of hope for those Singaporeans who have lost their jobs or will lose their jobs.</p><p>Today, some Singaporeans would be downcast at the thought of how to finance or how to continue financing their mortgage and other commitments, or the opportunities they can or cannot provide to their school-going children when their own paychecks have dwindled or, in other cases, evaporated.</p><p>On mid-career workers, I hope the Government considers and incentivises more companies and businesses, through either rebates or reliefs, to offer more of such traineeships and opportunities to mid-career Singaporeans, so that they can learn new skills and embark on new careers.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, more than $50 billion has been committed from the Reserves to fight COVID-19 in the matter of a few short months, more than 10 times the amount drawn from the Reserves during the Global Financial Crisis about a decade ago.&nbsp;Unlike the Resilience Budget, I noticed the Fortitude Budget did not include a line to say that the Government would be prepared to make further draws on past Reserves to deal with COVID-19, if necessary. In this regard, the employment of the Contingencies Fund in this Budget answered the question posed during my Resilience Budget debate speech, which queried whether the next Government would have enough fiscal firepower to deal with the effects of the COVID-19 fallout.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Nonetheless, I have a few questions for the Deputy Prime Minister on this count. It would appear that this Contingencies Fund would provide the Government with a significant buffer against post-circuit breaker uncertainties. What is of interest is the decision-making process behind the allocation of this amount. How did the Government settle on it? And on what basis was it justified to the President?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">After delivering the Fortitude Budget, the Deputy Prime Minister was also quoted in the media as saying that Singapore\\'s financial position will be a lot weaker in the coming years. This is a very significant comment on Singapore\\'s fiscal health, the implications of which have not been discussed in public in a significant way thus far. Can the Deputy Prime Minister share more details on his thinking on this matter and what can the public expect in the short and medium term over the next five to 10 years, especially with regard to recurrent taxes and the social contract between people and the state.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">This brings me to my second \"E\" </span>–&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">engagement. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, when the first of four Budgets this year was announced by the Deputy Prime Minister on 28 February, I stated in my speech during the debate that as far as the Workers\\' Party was concerned, politics would take a backseat for a unity of purpose in times of the COVID-19 crisis so that Singapore could&nbsp;single-mindedly overcome this challenge.&nbsp;The Workers\\' Party has not come in to publicly criticise the Government on its handling of an unprecedented crisis in ways that would undermine the national effort. But Singaporeans have a right to expect a thorough review and accounting on the response to this public health crisis. Some, both in and out of this House, have suggested a commission of inquiry or some other independent body to review specific aspects of the Government\\'s response thus far.&nbsp;Whatever the form such a reckoning takes in future, our position, as a constructive Opposition, requires us to communicate the feelings of Singaporeans on the ground in Parliament.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">As we exit the circuit breaker, there is the perception that the Government\\'s handling of the COVID-19 crisis has certainly not included adjectives more commonly associated with the Singapore Government, such as clarity and decisiveness. For example, there is a broadly accepted view that the public should have been told early and clearly, and not through illegal recordings behind closed doors, for example, that universal masking would prove to be a challenge in view of supply constraints requiring the Government to prioritise our healthcare and other essential workers. To this end, straight talk, especially on Singapore\\'s limitations and shortcomings in managing the crisis, did not always define official Government communication on COVID-19.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">There was a perception among some Singaporeans of a public confused with many piecemeal announcements, u-turns and positions that did not gel intuitively, like limiting the number of visits to parents and grandparents to two individuals, when public transport safe distancing rules had already been lifted. Other Members have spoken about the operational frustrations of businesses, like those in construction, and I will not repeat these. This morning, the Straits Times carried a story on COVID-19 regulations comparing hair treatments that go on for hours, contrasted with directives that prohibit beauty treatments that last more than 30 minutes. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">For some Singaporean businesses, at times, it felt as if no one in Government was taking ownership of how COVID-19 directives would be perceived, interpreted and understood on the ground.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Then, they were higher order trade-offs and decisions that could have turned very differently in view of numerous unknowns associated with the spread of the virus. While other countries requisitioned mask supply lines, it would appear that Singapore resisted doing so, probably with an eye on the future so that international companies would always see Singapore as a reliable place to do business. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">This must have been a tough call. But rather than getting the public to speculate about these decision making trade-offs, such as whether the possible shortage of reagents to ramp up COVID-19 testing far more quickly was a problem, the public was largely left to infer positions that ought to have been unequivocally made by the Government.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">For younger Singaporeans, this crisis has been educational and revealing. COVID-19 has reinforced for some Singaporeans, if not exposed for others, especially younger Singaporeans, how reliant Singapore is on foreign sources of manpower and supplies. This is something commentators online would do well to remember when they speak ill or run down our neighbours. Malaysia closed its borders before our circuit breaker, resulting in a difficult adjustment for many Singaporean companies, both public and private, reliant on foreign labour. Can we imagine the psychological impact on Singapore had Malaysia stopped food supplies like vegetables as well?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Public crisis preparedness, such as a lack of understanding of emergency terminology like DORSCON also revealed gaps that need to be plugged in future. A belated explanation of Singapore having raised its DORSCON level to Orange in 2009 as a result of H1N1, ostensibly to temper panic-buying, and the jolting of memories about the existence of a rice stockpile could not overcome a distinct lack of understanding and preparedness about emergencies amongst many segments of the public. This is unlike the mindset of many Merdeka and Pioneer Generation Singaporeans who would recall emergency preparedness exercises, such as water rationing, for example.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Engaging more Singaporeans on the need to better compensate for, if not overcome, our limitations in key areas and reintroducing public emergency preparedness for psychological resilience, has been exposed by the crisis, and significant focus would need to be placed on this in future.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">To that end, and critically, we must take stock of the entire economy and relook at sectors where greater self-sufficiency and buffer are required, especially essential jobs and services. Such a thorough review could potentially become a source of more job opportunities for Singaporeans, pegged at more respectable wage levels in some cases. I hope this is something the National Jobs Council can look at.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">The last \"E\" I wish to talk about is empathy. We have experienced it in bucket loads over the last two months </span>–<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;a greater acknowledgement of mental health issues; warm cheers of support for healthcare frontliners from HDB flats and condominiums; more stories of Singaporeans offering the Food Panda or Grab delivery person water or a drink before he or she fulfils the next order; and the list goes on.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Singaporeans may have grumbled, but they got on with their lives in spite of the inconveniences of the circuit breaker and played their part in protecting lives and livelihoods. In addition, many younger Singaporeans have taken a great interest in those less well-off. This has been one of the seminal moments of the COVID-19 experience thus far. Volunteering to help distribute food to Singaporeans in need, volunteering to swab foreign workers, delivering laptops to families in need with school-going children, and so much more. In a crisis that this generation of Singaporeans will never forget, we saw the best of Singapore. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, being able to put oneself in the shoes of the other is the very definition of empathy.&nbsp;And empathy is a significant source from which fortitude springs and a basis to call upon the cohesion and strength needed for Singapore to overcome challenges and odds. In response to my Resilience Budget speech and, specifically the reference to the New Deal in the US, Deputy Prime Minister Heng cautioned about localising schisms from the US where liberals support comprehensive relief and reform programmes, and conservatives oppose plans that are hostile to growth and business.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">The Deputy Prime Minister would be aware that Singapore is not alien to diametrically opposed ideological perspectives and these have been present in Singapore for some time. The online discourse has, in fact, accentuated it. Another case in point is the recent response of various Chambers of Commerce on the calls made by Singaporeans to moderate the number of foreign workers in Singapore as a result of the COVID-19 experience. With many corporates and big businesses already perceived to be over-represented in our political ecology, be it through the grassroots or through their association in private-public national level committees, the Government needs to consider how it can become a better arbiter between different views, to give and encourage more space to our youths, NGOs unlinked to GLCs and trade unions, and the people sector to voice their contrarian views and perspectives.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">This should be done while retaining a laser-like focus on fact-based conversations that portend a progressive future all Singaporeans can endeavour towards. To this end, we have some Singaporeans, including young ones, wondering whether we had done right by foreign workers, calling for an improvement of their living conditions, but only to be met by naysayers questioning their motives. In fact, COVID-19 has, paradoxically, vindicated a smaller group of Singaporeans who have been lobbying for improvements to foreign worker management policies for years.&nbsp;To that end, the Government\\'s decision to quickly introduce guidelines for better foreign worker accommodation standards and the promotion of a more respectful culture between Singaporeans and migrant workers has been a very positive development.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">In my view, Mr Speaker, we should count ourselves fortunate that we have citizens who are the loving critics amongst us, some of whom have been questioned in this very House in this term of Government. Members would recall one citizen\\'s poems were nitpicked with a view to cast wholly negative aspersions on his character, even though that individual was not present in the House to defend himself.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, when any leader or person of influence engages in what will be interpreted as dog-whistling, it sets the tone for how members of the public debate with those whose views they disagree with.&nbsp;If binary black-and-white perspectives are the shape of how we as a society deal with differences after COVID-19, Singapore will become an ordinary society, no different from many around the world. But nobody expects the Government to willy-nilly change its decision at the first sign of pressure and agree with a critic. Singaporeans do recognise the multitude of perspectives the Government has to take cognisance of, but it is important to recognise and not forget that citizens criticise and even organise, because they care.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Moving forward, the Government should look at opening more avenues like Parliament for citizen engagement, greater data sharing and empower other institutions like our think-tanks, and nudge the mainstream media to give alternative perspectives more voice and even provide platforms piloting change on a small scale. As we traverse the post-COVID-19 volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world, we need to place more faith and promote even greater participation from Singaporeans than ever before.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">In conclusion, Mr Speaker, COVID-19 has prompted many Singaporeans to ask fundamental questions about our economy and who we are as a people. As many Singaporeans will have to buckle down to take on new skills and jobs, COVID-19 has also provided an opportunity for Singaporeans to take a deeper interest in their country and their society.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">This is a positive development, even as COVID-19 has hit Singapore while we contend with other pressing short and medium term issues, such as demographic shifts, technological disruption, climate change and, more ominously, the impact to our position as a global Asia hub from US-China competition and rivalry.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">The economic picture may be bleak today and, for some, a moment of anguish. But as I had put forth in my response to the Resilience Budget, there are opportunities to reset some fundamental assumptions about the type of society we can endeavour and pivot towards. I use the word \"pivot\" because Singapore is a far more complex and varied economy and society than it was in 1965. The transition will demand everyone\\'s participation, effort and energies.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">But with the people determined and committed to the nation\\'s recovery and success, COVID-19 is a golden opportunity for this generation to envision and build a better Singapore. Mr Speaker, I support the Fortitude Budget.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Denise Phua.</p><h6>2.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, four Budgets in less than four months. Kudos to the Government and especially the MOF team who stitched the Budgets together.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more disruption than one can imagine – changing lives and livelihoods as we knew them to be. Economic activities have plummeted, the depth and speed of which rival that of the Great Depression.&nbsp;Experts worldwide cannot agree on how long the downturn will be. There is no telling what the recovery is going to look like – V-curve, U-curve, Z-curve, a smooth bounce-back, a slow-burn recovery or worse still, a relapse.</p><p>One of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\\'s favourite quotes during this season is by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill who said this, \"Now, this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is perhaps, the end of the beginning\". Indeed, change has only begun even as Singapore exits from the circuit breaker. Many people, businesses and individuals, understandably are very concerned about how this recovery will look like.&nbsp;I therefore seek Deputy Prime Minister and MOF\\'s reading of the pace of recovery and what the overall strategy would look like in the best case scenario and in the worst case scenario.</p><p>I want to move next to touch on two things. One, on the small and medium enterprises or SMEs; and two, on charities, the social service sector and the disabled.</p><p>First, on the SMEs. We all know that the SMEs form an integral part of Singapore\\'s economic landscape, embodying the spirit of entrepreneurship of our nation and employing more than two-thirds<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;of our local workforce. I applaud the Singapore Government\\'s and especially MTI\\'s relentless efforts in supporting them, even before the pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p><p>SMEs with a headstart and stronger technological capabilities are likely to recover faster from the pandemic. The prognosis of the rest of the economy will be uncertain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A survey of 48 merchant associations representing almost 500 merchants was conducted in May 2020 by the Federation of Merchant Association Singapore\\'s heartland enterprises unit. When the merchants were asked what challenges they face in joining the e-commerce wagon, as they put it, about half of the respondents quoted these two top challenges: one, the lack of their own internal capabilities to sustain the digitalisation efforts; and two, the cost of implementation and the recurring costs of digitalisation. Capabilities and cost, not only during adoption, but also in sustaining the efforts, remain their top concerns.</p><p>So, using a simple segmentation based on one\\'s willingness to change and two, the ability to change, there appears to be four groups of SMEs.</p><p>The first group: those who are willing and able to change. I think they will benefit most from Government schemes and they include the early adopters and the high-potential start-ups that are targeted in the Budget. How will we facilitate this group more to help them scale further and to open more doors for and with them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Group two: those who are able to change and not willing to change. How do we convince and incentivise them so more of them will come on board?</p><p>Group three: those who are not able to change and not willing to change. I think we have no choice but to let them exit. But how will we, considering that they are also Singapore SMEs, how will we help them exit with a softer landing?</p><p>The last group, which is likely the largest, those who are willing to change but not able to change for various reasons. This is the largest group for which the strategy has to be training and coaching. Sir, it is not enough just to convert them. There is a need, a real need to make them not just \"apprentices\" and also \"disciples\" so that more of them can sustain digitalisation efforts and continue to be successful as we emerge from the crisis.</p><p>Is there some way by which we can invest and handhold them longer and deeper? Pair them perhaps with not just simply Digitalisation Ambassadors, but Digitalisation Coaches who can equip them with more and deeper operational and systemic skills and knowledge in such areas like backend stock inventory management, customer fulfilment, digital marketing skills and so forth.</p><p>And finally, for those who eventually have to cease operations but nonetheless have the acumen and energy to continue, can there be, for the SMEs, an equivalent of a \"professional-conversion\" scheme, just like what we have for individuals, a placement scheme, to help them seize&nbsp;business or job opportunities in sectors that are more in the sunrise spaces like urban farming, logistics, warehousing, healthcare, estate maintenance and so forth?&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I want to move from business to the charities, social service sector and the disabled.</p><p>Sir, like the SMEs in Singapore\\'s economic landscape, many charities and social service agencies or SSAs form an integral part of Singapore\\'s social service landscape. The services range from serving the elderly to the young, families, they operate in nursing homes, day activity centres, family service centres, early intervention to special education schools.</p><p>I thank Deputy Prime Minister Heng for acknowledging the importance of SSAs and charities as, \"key partners\", especially in this period. Deputy Prime Minister shared that in the years ahead, a \"stronger social service sector will be even more critical\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I want to also thank Deputy Prime Minister for including the charities and SSAs in the Fortitude Budget in many schemes, such as Job Support Scheme and the Enhanced Fundraising Programme to match donations up to $250,000 per charity. These are all appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>I have several suggestions for consideration by Government for this sector and for the people served by the sector.&nbsp;</p><p>Suggestion one: raise the cap of $250,000 in the Enhanced Fundraising Programme for larger charities. Sir, the larger charities run into tens and hundreds of millions of dollars in budget. They run community hospitals and disability centres. And fundraising provides a substantial top up to Government grants and subsidies for them. For such a time as this, fundraising is expectedly very challenging. It is hence useful for Government to consider raising the matching amount in order to incentivise more donors to invest now, rather than later or never.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Suggestion two: for this sector is to target high needs areas. There are groups with high support needs which call for more attention and resourcing so that they are not left behind. Some are the more severely disabled groups, such as beneficiaries in the autism day activity centres where we serve the more severe ones, residential homes, such as that run by St Andrew\\'s, families with rare disorders are kids with rare disorders and multiple disabilities and lower income households sandwiched by elderly and younger disabled. Target high needs areas.</p><p>Suggestion three: can we include more blatantly, more explicitly and visibly charities and the social service sector in the transformation masterplan of Singapore? Transformation of a nation is needed&nbsp;– not just in the business sector but also in the not-for-profit sector.&nbsp;Many of the push for digitalisation, innovation and entrepreneurship in business are relevant to the people sector. The willing amongst them, like the SMEs, require not only just Digital Ambassadors but also digital coaches and partners. Charities with high potential and good track records, should be facilitated and governed with a lighter touch. Let them thrive, let them push the boundaries to greater heights and support them in their transformation.&nbsp;</p><p>Suggestion four: include vulnerable groups such as the disabled right at the start of planning in all of the good things: the digitalistion, jobs and skills upgrading movement, including and not limited to the exciting plans for the new National Jobs Council, SG-United Jobs and Traineeship and SkillsFuture efforts. In fact, adopt the principle of what is commonly known now as universal design and design for all, right at the start. BCA and MND have already done so in the design of buildings and the physical built environment. The same should be applied in other areas as well in the protection and creation of jobs an skills upgrading. So, that is four&nbsp;– include the people sector including&nbsp;the vulnerable, the disabled; right at the start in the planning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And suggestion five: the last one for this group, is to start a disability chapter in the National Jobs Council.&nbsp;It is no secret that jobs are already hard to come by for persons with disabilities during normal times. Commissioned by MSF Minister, Mr Desmond Lee, a workgroup that is led by Minister of State Sam Tan and myself is working on the underlying factors for this issue and a report will be published by the end of the year. The COVID-19 outbreak, however, adds urgency to the challenges faced by the disability community especially in the areas of digitalisation and jobs. I therefore urge Deputy Prime Minister and Minster for Finance Heng and Senior Minister Tharman to set up a chapter in the National Jobs Council for the employability training and employment for the disabled so that they will not fall further behind.</p><p>In conclusion, Sir, on the lost, least and last in society.</p><p>Sir, this battle against our common enemy, COVID-19, can only be truly won if we include whom some in our society perceive as the lost, least and the last amongst us. Let us not give up easily on those who are willing to change but not able to change for some reasons, whether they are SMEs, social service agencies, our elderly, our disabled or others who are vulnerable in our Singapore family. They say it takes a globe to fight this pandemic. And indeed, the globe includes us and it starts with each one of us.</p><p>Once again, I quote Winston Churchill who said, \"These are not dark days these are great days... we must all thank God that we have been allowed, each of us according to our stations to play a part in making these days memorable in the history of our race.\"&nbsp;</p><p>And I want to end off with a quote by our founding father of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, of whom I know Deputy Prime Minister Heng is a great fan. Mr Lee Kuan Yew said this during the post SARS period, in his experience \"in any battle, the morale and the spirit of the people will decide the outcome. I never believed we would fail\".</p><p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew knew at that time it was going to be tough, like climbing up the face of a cliff. But we, like he said, \"must have the guts and determination to climb the face of the cliff and we will climb up the face of the cliff!\" And if I might add, with fortitude and not just the hindsight vision of 20-20.</p><p>Sir, we can only be #strongertogether. I support the Fortitude Budget wholeheartedly.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Yip Pin Xiu.</p><h6>2.43 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Speaker, last week when Deputy Prime Minister delivered the Fortitude Budget, I had a moment of relief, as did many Singaporeans, to hear that the Government is helping to keep jobs and giving more support to businesses that might be struggling. The relief for sectors hit hardest and businesses still unable to open is very much welcomed. It has been months of hard work by the Government. Thank you for your dedication and to Singaporeans for playing their part.</p><p>Many businesses are affected during this period, with many unsure of their future.</p><p>This COVID-19 pandemic is causing unparalleled uncertainty across many fronts. One industry that I am immersed in is the sports and fitness industry. With the reliefs, businesses may have less worries for the next month or so but with the uncertainty of when they can resume operations due to safe distancing measures, or when Singaporeans will come back to sports due to their own personal concerns of safety, it is difficult for them to plan for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>This industry is having a tough time. Most sports and fitness activities stopped even before the circuit breaker started as there were already other measures in place to flatten the curve at that point of time. Most gyms and studios have frozen or adjusted their memberships to retain clients, while some are conducting online classes. Planned events from competitions to fundraising events have been cancelled. All these had led to significant revenue loss across the sector.</p><p>These are businesses that keep our society healthy and resilient and the COVID-19 pandemic is putting them at a risk. Sports and fitness helps to build a stronger national identity. It improves our health, productivity, reduces medical expenses and enhances social cohesion. Sports and fitness are for people of all ages, abilities and walks of life.</p><p>More importantly, the Sports and Fitness industry is one of the industries that has a huge knock-on effect to the rest of the economy since the Sports and Fitness industry is not just about people exercising or playing games&nbsp;– it also involves many other sectors and businesses such as tourism, retail, events management, marketing, sports education and training, support services such as Public Relations, fundraising and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>I understand that we must now proceed with caution as we slowly emerge after two months of circuit breaker measures and I wholeheartedly agree with it. We do not want our efforts to go to waste. We must all still do our part.&nbsp;</p><p>The current JSS scheme supports businesses that are unable to resume when a circuit breaker ends, with 75% of monthly wages till August or until they open. When a Sports and Fitness industry opens. Again, it will receive 25% of Monday wages being in JSS Tier 3. However, there will be many safe distancing measures in placed. For example, only being able to have one person per swimming lane or the spacing between each individual has to be huge, hence, only accommodating six people in the studio at all times. This cut in numbers will result in a low income coming in. The Sports and Fitness industry is finding it difficult to survive. Now, as they already had to dig in the reserves for the past two months or so. Besides paying their employees who may have already taken a pay cut, there are also other expenses. If unable to cope, these schools and clubs might start closing down and it will affect our pipeline as the schools and clubs are an important pathway for our sporting performance.</p><p>Right now, what will be helpful is if we have a clearer view. When Phase Two comes, outdoor sporting facilities can open again. Sports and Fitness is a highly varied industry, with many different kinds of activities&nbsp;– from outdoor sports, to personal training sessions, to tennis where players stand on opposing ends of the court, to swimming, to indoor activities such as yoga and kickboxing.</p><p>There are questions that many businesses are asking&nbsp;– when the numbers remain low, what will the plan be? What about indoor facilities and when these facilities can start again, what will the most number of people be allowed in at any point in time? These details will help this industry be more certain and help the industry chart the path ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>With all the positives that this industry brings to Singaporeans, we still want to see them around after the COVID-19 pandemic so that they can continue contributing positively to the community. If we continue doing our parts to keep each other safe, we can look forward to getting back into sporting activities safely. The rest of the services associated with the Sports and Fitness industry that I had highlighted above would also be able to better plan their respective businesses and know how to react to the new norms when the time comes. We will all have to adapt to a new kind of normal, to include safe distancing measures and ensure we come out of this stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>We talk about digitising in times like this. However, the Sports and Fitness industry is one of the sectors that is harder to digitise, as its very essence is to get people to go out and be active, healthy and interact socially. Yes, payments can be done online, some activities can shift online but It will be hard to do things like instructions online especially for our younger, older and special population groups that require a greater level of supervision. Certain activities that require a physical medium like swimming, will also lose out, because, say for example, why would parents want their children to do land activities online for swimming classes when they can take up a land sport instead? Some businesses need more help than digitising.</p><p>For those that can find a way to digitise, the Enterprise Innovation and Capability Development Grant was announced a week ago. This grant supports businesses that can come out with innovative and smart solutions within the sport industry. We eagerly await the application instructions.</p><p>More importantly, this is also a great opportunity for the Government to take a more holistic approach in improving the entire industry and provide the infrastructural approach and guidance to help the industry grow. This could be done by taking a more inclusive approach in education and towards the sporting enterprises, to help them grow together with this economy.</p><p>More emphasis needs to be placed on sports in Singapore. Starting from our schools. We must create an environment where sports is a bigger part of the curriculum from kindergarten all the way through Junior College and Polytechnic. Sports is nowhere near the top of our priority list, but what we learn from sports will also play a big part in our education. Institutions should embrace sporting values into their own culture. When we adequately and holistically impart the fun and advantages of sport in them at a young age, it helps to translate into lifelong participation in sports.</p><p>Personally, being actively involved in sports since a young age has helped me greatly. My parents saw the value in sports. It has not only helped me physically but also mentally and emotionally. When I was younger, I was not a very good student. I did not get good grades, but after winning a gold medal at the Paralympics in Beijing, I came back and did my \"O\" levels. I did not hit my expectations but thankfully I managed to get into Polytechnic. Then, I thought to myself, why not use the perseverance, grit, focus and everything I learnt from swimming to apply to my studies? I was then laser focused on getting my grades up and started to do pretty well and eventually got into SMU. If not for swimming, I would not be where i am today.&nbsp;</p><p>When kids start participating more in sports, their families watch them play and that helps with family bonding. This leads to a more supportive family and community. Parents are our first sport coaches and they impart&nbsp;social and family values through play. Similarly, as we age, other important values can be imparted through sports.</p><p>For the sporting industry to be sustainable in Singapore, we must create a stronger industry with more opportunities. For our sporting culture to grow, the Sports and Fitness industry must grow too. Sport Singapore has done a commendable job with Active SG, Singapore Sports Institute, Sports Cares and more. We have amazing facilities and host world class events.&nbsp;We must continue our efforts and continue to improve by growing the sports industry.</p><p>As a regulator, an approach would be to work closer with the private sector to enhance capabilities, resources and business opportunities.&nbsp;Sports and fitness businesses are an important pillar of this industry as they bring expertise, knowledge and organised play to the table.&nbsp;They employ passionate Singaporeans that are constantly shaping the lives of people of all ages and backgrounds. And we need them to thrive so as to achieve the outcomes I spoke about earlier.</p><p>One of the ways is to provide them access to the many facilities that we have developed over the years. We have many facilities that are largely reserved for use only by the public sector.&nbsp;Opening up access would create more opportunities for the industry to grow.</p><p>More importantly, to build sustainability, we also need to accelerate the growth of businesses who have great potential. For these companies, we could offer support for growth, examples include upskilling of workforce, hiring of middle aged educators who are looking for a career switch, support for programme or curriculum development and support for new market development.&nbsp;</p><p>Another approach is to take a more inclusionary path in organising the Sports and Fitness industry.&nbsp;SportSG as a regulator has done a fantastic job with its various initiatives to get people to participate in sports. However, the impact may be greater and faster, if we allow the Sports and Fitness industry operators to help in this process. One of the ways we could do this is to allow the Sports and Fitness industry to fill in the gaps and allow them to grow, rather than to take a one size fits all approach. In the long run, we will have a more vibrant, sustainable sporting Singapore.</p><p>Mr Speaker, the next group of people that I will be speaking for, are some people that tend to be left behind because they have more specific circumstances and needs that you might not think about unless you were in their shoes. In this period of time, how many Singaporeans have thought about how somebody who is blind and living alone while observing safe distancing measures is coping? If a student with muscular dystrophy needs an oxygen tank with a breathing mask and their teacher asks them to put on a face mask or shield, which would mean that they have to take the oxygen tank off, so that the teacher does not get into trouble for not observing the measures. How would this affect the student and their family?&nbsp;</p><p>In times like this, it is especially crucial to look out for those who may be struggling more than others. I recognise that SGEnable and Social Service Agency partners are helping people with special needs and the vulnerable in the community. I see the C.A.R.E initiative by Mediacorp Enable Fund aiming to help people with disabilities and their care-givers ride out the COVID-19 pandemic as the impact on this community has been, in their words \"disproportionately huge\". This fund is driven by public donations and we greatly appreciate that. Together, we can all continue playing a part to ensure no one falls through the cracks.&nbsp;</p><p>The lack of information to certain disability groups in Singapore is counter-productive to the effort in combating the COVID-19 outbreak. The right to information is crucial for ensuring public awareness, trust and fighting misinformation.</p><p>We have to ensure that public health information and communication is accessible on all important media publications. It would be ideal if a Singapore Sign Language interpreter is present for all live, recorded events and communications. This includes national addresses, press briefings and live social media. I am happy to see that the Budget speech last week included Singapore Sign Language and live notes. Over the weekend, I was watching a live panel discussion on social media – Get Active TV that featured Minister Fu and SportSG. They too had a Singapore Sign Language interpreter and live notes. I am very heartened at this great development and hopefully this can continue on all other updates and media during this time and beyond. We look forward to a time when all media comes with live Singapore Sign Language interpretation. This is important because that is the first language for many people who are deaf.&nbsp;</p><p>We need public materials that can be converted into \"Easy Read\" format so that they can be accessible for people with cognitive impairment. We need to develop accessible written information products by using appropriate document formats with structured headings, large print, braille versions and formats for people who are deafblind or visually impaired. The images we put out out there have to be inclusive and enable the independence of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs).&nbsp;For example, the current level of safe entry QR code tends to be placed a bit too high. A consideration could be to place it at varying easy to reach heights as we have done so with many lift buttons.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, supermarkets have done a great job at dealing with the increased demand and restocking of shelves. The priority shopping hour for vulnerable groups is a great start and we hope that persons with all disabilities can access this, including those with invisible disabilities. Some PWDs find it difficult to go to supermarkets because they are staying at home&nbsp;due to having compromised immune systems. Hence, other than a priority shopping hour, introducing priority delivery slots will also help. Many PWDs are finding it hard to get deliveries. This may be a combination of there not being enough slots as well as the accessibility of websites not being optimal.</p><p>Other than food, access to medical prescriptions and other health care supplies are highly essential as well. Existing volunteer networks can be activated to help deliver these supplies. If possible, doctors should be able to see their at-risk patients online for check ups because they are afraid of going to hospitals to get exposed yet they do need to see the doctor for their regular check up.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides medications, some disabilities require more home care and physiotherapy services. These services cannot be stopped as it will bring detrimental results mentally and physically to PWDs and their family. In some cases, not getting their physiotherapy will result in irreversible loss of muscle or contracture which will permanently impact their quality of life. In just two weeks\\' time, they would have permanently lost quite a bit of function.&nbsp;</p><p>Employment of persons with disabilities remains relatively low in Singapore and for those that are employed, not all are fortunate enough to be able to execute their work from home. The main issues for PWDs working from home are whether their employers can adequately physically and financially provide the assistive devices and technology they may need to work at home. Many themselves are not able to do so because of their socio-economic challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>For PWDs whose job scope used to be done predominantly face-to-face, the added need for technology to be able to potentially do the work online would mean increased spending. While there is an existing Assistive Technology Fund for Persons with Disabilities, it is a reimbursement fund tied to means testing and the reimbursement can also take up to three weeks which may not be a feasible option for those who are struggling financially. Schemes such as NEU PC to provide laptops to students from low-income families are welcome. However, assistive technology and aids are usually more expensive to purchase.&nbsp;This translates to a loss of income and opportunities to retrain or learn new skills.</p><p>Socially, the lack of access to IT equipment can mean missing out on opportunities to maintain or grow connections with friends and families. This can in turn negatively impact those with psycho-social disabilities, increasing mental stress and straining existing coping mechanisms.&nbsp;</p><p>As we are encouraged to work from home or have home-based learning, what assistance is being provided to ensure that the assistive technology is available in all homes for persons with disabilities? Many of them face socio-economic challenges and may not be able to afford IT equipment, assistive aids and broadband to help them better cope with life in this period of time.&nbsp;</p><p>Persons with disabilities who had jobs that cannot be done online or had difficulties finding employment before the COVID-19 pandemic are even more concerned that they will not be able to return to work or get a job. They are also concerned about the accessibility or inclusivity of job training and retraining programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>The financial assistance provided by the Temporary Relief fund, COVID-19 Support Grant and other schemes such as SIRS are greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>Those with disabilities already often have higher healthcare and personal care costs and these costs are likely to increase as alternative or emergency arrangements are made during the circuit breaker or the phases after that. In addition, some PWDs rely on informal and temporary work arrangements and as such, do not strictly fit into the eligibility requirements of SIRS.</p><p>Taking that into consideration, can the Government consider extending the amount that is given and the duration of the relief for persons with disabilities or increasing the eligibility to those with higher household incomes?</p><p>Lastly, it is important to have a disability touch point for the COVID-19 response. Having a touch point within the Government or related agencies where persons with disabilities, their care-givers and organisations can feedback on the accessibility of COVID-19 response information and measures is key. We need a fast response as a delay might cause harm to some individuals in special situations. This touch point ensures that there is two-way communication about the COVID-19 response and we can identify the gaps quickly and share best practices. The best way to find out what people need is to ask them.</p><p>In this pandemic, we have to look out for all so that we can truly be an inclusive and united Singapore. I support the Budget.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chee Hong Tat, I believe you have a clarification.</p><h6>3.03 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I would like to clarify a point that Mr Pritam Singh made in his speech earlier regarding public communication on the use of masks.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, since late January this year, during the initial period when the virus first emerged in Singapore and even before the virus was called COVID-19, the Government had already started explaining publicly our position on masks. We explained to the public that there were supply constraints globally and some economies have in fact banned the export of masks. We then called on Singaporeans that we have to use masks appropriately. Please do not hoard so that we will have enough supplies, especially for those groups that need them most.</p><p>Sir, what I have just said are based on media reports and information that can be found in the public domain.</p><p>Sir, this Government has always been open and transparent with Singaporeans in our explanation and in our communications. When there is new information, there is new evidence, we would likewise adopt an open and transparent manner in our communications because we know that is important in our collective fight against this pandemic.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Singh.</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>: Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for that clarification. In that vein, can I ask the Senior Minister of State, with regard to the decision earlier this week to stop usage of face shields except for certain classes of individuals, how was that decision originally taken to allow for face shields and then, a u-turn made thereafter to limit it to specific classes? How did that information change from the health experts I imagine that the Government has access to?</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, I think the Multi-Ministry Task Force or MTF has explained why there was a change in the advisory on the use of face shields. This is as Mr Singh himself alluded to&nbsp;– based on the advice from medical professionals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>: I understand that, Senior Minister of State. Can I ask what were the reasons given by those experts for that change?</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, I am not a doctor, so I am not equipped to provide the medical reasons to answer Mr Singh\\'s question in detail&nbsp;—</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Gan would like to elaborate.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: But I think the MTF and the medical professionals have provided the explanation. It is about safety. It is about protecting everybody\\'s health and safety.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Minister Gan Kim Yong.</p><p><strong>The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong)</strong>: Mr Speaker, perhaps I could assist in explaining the rationale behind that. As we move into Phase One of our opening, we will see increased interaction within the community, among people. And therefore, we will have to make sure that additional safeguards are put in place. Given that face shields do not provide a full coverage of your face, your nose and your mouth because there are gaps between the shield and your face, it poses certain risks.&nbsp;</p><p>These risks are less of a concern during the circuit breaker period when most people are asked to stay home. Therefore, we allowed face shields to be used. But when we open up the community and the economy, we expect more interaction and therefore, we need to enhance the protection where possible. Therefore, we encouraged people to use the full-face mask instead of a face shield.</p><p>But we still allow face shields to be used in specific situations where mask-wearing is not practical.&nbsp;One example which we gave was during teaching. Teachers need to make sure that their teaching is clearly heard and it is important for them to see and to interact with the children. We have therefore allowed face shields to be used for teaching. But in other circumstances, we will require a mask to be used.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Chee.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to reiterate the reason for my clarification in the first place was to highlight that the Government has been open and transparent in our communications on the use of masks since the beginning&nbsp;– since the late January period when the virus first emerged in Singapore. I think that is really my key point&nbsp;– that we have publicly explained that and these are all in the public domain.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Darryl David.</p><h6>3.10 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, the measures introduced in our four Budgets thus far have been designed to provide short-term measures and immediate relief to save businesses and preserve livelihoods and jobs, as well as to accelerate the long-term transformation of Singapore\\'s socio-economic framework and foundations, so that we, as a country, can emerge stronger from this crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While there has been a&nbsp;comprehensive range of schemes and measures rolled out, I would like to focus on a few key areas in my speech.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has seen the Government take bold, unprecedented steps to help our businesses stay afloat. As most of us know, two of the biggest overheads that businesses must manage are manpower costs and rent. To support manpower cost and to save jobs, the Government has introduced the Jobs Support Scheme and either waived or provided rebates on manpower levies.&nbsp;</p><p>To help companies manage rental cost, the Government first introduced several measures such as rebate on property tax and waiver of rental for tenants of Government properties.</p><p>More significantly, this is now being reinforced with proposed legislation to mandate commercial landlords to grant rental waivers to their SME tenants who have suffered a reduction in businesses due to COVID-19. This is rare in Singapore\\'s context as the Government does not usually&nbsp;engage in direct intervention of the market, especially in private business arrangements. But this is not a common crisis and this uncommon step of intervening demonstrates the commitment of the Government to help SMEs weather through the storm.&nbsp;</p><p>I am in firm support of this and while&nbsp;this is a positive boost for SME tenants, there is also the possibility that a significant number of smaller landlords could themselves be small companies or even individual owners who are dependent on this rental income to meet their income needs and financial commitments. Waiving the rental income for their tenants might thus result in them being deprived of revenue or even being slapped with penalties from financial institutions because they are unable to service their loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What help and support would the Government be able to provide smaller landlords in such situations?&nbsp;And if these smaller landlords are unable to fulfill their financial obligations, would the Government be able to intervene to mandate that financial institutions perhaps could suspend loan repayments until this group of landlords are able to start collecting their rental income?</p><p>I would like to move on now, Mr Speaker, Sir, to helping workers and those who have lost their jobs.</p><p>Despite all the measures that we have put in place to support companies through COVID-19, not all companies will survive the downturn and the global economic slowdown. Retrenchment is thus imminently unavoidable. It is heartening to know that one of the major thrusts of the main and supplementary Budgets is to preserve jobs and a new National Jobs Council will be set up to look at job creation and the deep skilling of workers.&nbsp;</p><p>COVID-19 has transformed the way we think about work. In many countries, what was traditionally known as \"3D jobs\" – dirty, dangerous and demeaning – are now considered as important services that keep countries going, that keep communities going. Frontline jobs that were not given much attention in the past are now being recognised as being operationally essential.&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore is no exception. COVID-19, indeed, has created some jobs that were unheard of prior to the pandemic. In January this year, we would have no clue what a Safe Distancing Ambassador, a test swabber, a swab assistant or a temperature taker was. But they have now entered the lexicon of our everyday use&nbsp;– in terms of the language that we use. Indeed, as reported&nbsp;in the media this week, we will soon have Digital Ambassadors to help hawkers and senior citizens to learn digital skills.&nbsp;</p><p>These jobs were clearly created out of the need to manage the challenges of COVID-19 and also help provide part-time employment to those who were made redundant by the crisis.&nbsp;In the mid term, certain jobs like Safe Distancing Ambassadors will continue to be relevant but in the long run, some of these&nbsp;jobs could be less necessary as we internalise the need to practise safe distancing, when a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available or as we level up on the digital front.</p><p>To ensure that this precious workforce does not become redundant when these semi-permanent positions are no longer required, how can we future-proof the career paths of currently employed Singaporeans and to help our people retrain, up-skill and continue to pivot and shapeshift, as it were, to stay relevant as we respond to the new normal.</p><p>I sincerely hope that this is something that the National Jobs Council will need to consider as it balances short-term national needs with the long-term prospects for our people.</p><p>The next topic, Mr Speaker, Sir, is on digitalisation and education.</p><p>In the early days of COVID-19, there was a meme circulating that the virus was more effective than CEOs and CTOs in pushing for digital transformation. This meme turned out to be quite prophetic and in the past few months, we have seen companies accelerating digital implementation and making remote work platforms mainstream in somewhat record time.&nbsp;</p><p>The same could be said about our schools. Since the start of the circuit breaker, school-going children across all age groups have adopted home-based learning. It was reported that more than 96% of students are participating in it. On the one hand, this figure is encouraging as it shows that our children have adapted well to learning on digital&nbsp;channels. Yet, on the other hand, it was reported that MOE had to loan out thousands of computing devices and internet dongles to families. These figures suggest that there is a gap in accessibility to digital learning.&nbsp;</p><p>It is heartening to know that MOE intends to accelerate the ownership of digital learning devices for all Secondary school children from their initial date of 2028.</p><p>However, I would like to clarify if there are similar plans to accelerate the ownership of these devices for children from other levels of study – so not just Secondary school students and above, but perhaps for Primary school students. And more critically, if there are, will this device be purchased off-the-shelf and supplied by different tech companies or will it be a proprietary device uniquely designed and manufactured by MOE for our schools and for our school children?</p><p>I am strongly advocating for the latter, Mr Speaker. In addition to have the opportunity for Singapore businesses to benefit from both hardware production and software development, the benefits to our children will be myriad.&nbsp;</p><p>With more control over the design and functionality of this device, this all-in-one custom-designed learning device could function as a lap-top, a tablet, an e-text book, and a communication tool. A veritable digital \"Swiss-Army Education Knife\" of sorts.</p><p>The ownership of this multi-function device might also eliminate the need for piles of back-breaking, physical textbooks year after year after year. Going to school in the future could be as easy as just bringing along this device and all forms of learning and work submission can be done digitally on a unified platform. Quite literally, we are putting the world in the hands of our school children. The software could be customised and adapted to suit the pace of learning for different children while also providing personal insights to how each student engages and interacts along the learning journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I envisage the schools of the future to be one where students would do everything off this device.&nbsp;The operating system of this device could function like an enhanced version of the MOE\\'s present Student Learning System (SLS) and would allow for more coordinated and unified communication and work planning. This would meet the twin goals of being environmentally friendly while also taking a huge step towards being a digital smart nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We could tier the ownership cost of the device depending on varying household incomes, with the aim that no school-going child should be deprived of their own personal learning device. No school-going child should be deprived of their own personal learning device.&nbsp;This would give our children, especially those from lower income background, a sense of pride and ownership that they have their own personal device that will allow them to navigate the same digital and virtual education landscapes as their peers. The deliberately neutral branding also encourages status equality, not to mention standard software and hardware upgrades that will leave no child lacking.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I know that this might seem like an audaciously ambitious idea, but aiming high and overachieving is something that Singapore has always done. So, I urge the MOE to give this idea a serious thought and I look forward to the day that not only can we ensure that every student – every student is provided with their own personal Smart Learning device, but we can take pride that this device was designed and produced by our MOE, specially for our children.&nbsp;Singapore could very well be the first nation in the world to achieve our vision of \"smart learning.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, 2020 will no doubt go down in memory as one of the most volatile years the world, and Singapore, has experienced. Yet in every crisis, lie opportunities to innovate and transform and the past 100 days have certainly seen our companies and schools doing just that, as they have experimented and innovated with new methods of doing business and conducting lessons.&nbsp;</p><p>As Singaporeans, we are a resilient people.&nbsp;And we can be masters of our own destiny and forge our own uniquely Singaporean path through this crisis. With the Government playing a pivotal role and strengthening its commitment to the people, I am certain that we will emerge as a stronger and more cohesive society after COVID-19. I thus conclude my speech in firm support of the Fortitude Budget.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Minister Desmond Lee.</p><h6>3.20 pm</h6><p><strong>The Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, COVID-19 has disrupted all sectors of the economy including construction. During the circuit breaker period, most construction work was suspended. Post circuit breaker, contractors are anxious to resume work quickly. Many have paid for material or are leasing equipment which are now sitting idle and since contractors are typically paid based on progress payments, no work means no payment; and we understand then anxiety.</p><p>While we want to resume construction activity quickly, it is equally important that we do so safely.&nbsp;The vast majority of our COVID-19 cases have been amongst construction workers. So, we do not want to restart hastily as a new case could easily cause another outbreak or new cluster among construction workers either on a construction site or in the dormitories.</p><p>Such a resurgence of infection would not only endanger the health of our workers and the wider community, but also bring the construction industry to a halt to get. This is not in anyone\\'s interest.&nbsp;It is in our common interest for construction work to resume in a phased and controlled manner.</p><p>We had the first tranche of projects which could not be left idle for long because of safety reasons. These have been allowed to restart from 2 June.&nbsp;Beyond this list of projects if firms have cleared workers and have put in place necessary safe management measures, firms can submit their applications to BCA and once approved they will be able to resume their projects.</p><p>On the Government end, my colleagues have been working hard on multiple fronts to allow construction activities to resume faster.</p><p>First, the inter-agency Task Force has been systematically and progressively clearing workers living in dormitories to ensure they are well so that they can return to work.&nbsp;Many contractors have shared with us their frustration about not knowing what is going on in the dormitories, as workers have been moved around several times during these few months. They would also like to know in advance when their workers can be tested and cleared for work so they can make plans for the projects to resume. They have asked for more information and updates on the dormitories\\' clearance situation.</p><p>Members would recognise the scale and complexity of the Task Force operations as there are 43 purpose-built dormitories and more than a 1,000 factory converted dormitories and construction temporary quarters housing more than 300,000 workers and the outbreak situation each dormitory is different.</p><p>Earlier this week, MOM announced the first batch of 60 cleared dormitories. And another 111 are due to be cleared in the coming weeks. We will provide more regular updates to our industry, including a rolling forecast of the dormitory clearance schedule to help employers and their clients plan ahead.</p><p>For workers living in the community, we have also set aside testing capacity to test construction workers regularly to ensure the health and safety and that of the wider community. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has shared concerns of contractors with the latest MOM announcement on foreign worker levy rebates. We understand the concerns. Government\\'s intention was to enable workers to be temporarily seconded to other firms to optimise manpower distribution, so that more projects can restart sooner.</p><p>However, firms have given feedback about this. For example, some of them may require their workers for their own projects that are about to start and cannot second their workers to other projects. MOM and BCA will review this and we will work with them and the industry to find better ways to achieve this optimisation for the benefit of the entire sector.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, on foreign worker accommodation. Er Dr Lee asked about the new requirements for existing factory converted dormitories and construction temporary quarters. Let me clarify that these requirements are not compulsory. We have piloted the new space norms for new quick build dormitories that will be put up by the end of the year and we have been working with industry associations to make sure these requirements are practical, even as we seek to achieve safety and will be prepared to consider further inputs.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, we have approved more than 20 requests from contractors who wish to build new CTQs or FCDs for their workers and will continue to facilitate such requests where possible. We have received feedback that the COVID-19 restart criteria for construction are stringent. Let me try to explain why we need to be careful.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a project with a single owner on a single site with all workers staying on site. The workers have not left the site since end March, even before circuit breaker. Full attention was given to protection and safety by all levels of management, such as ensuring proper segregation among workers, including not allowing workers from different levels of the dormitories to mix.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet that project had an infection prevalence rate of close to 30% amongst its workers.&nbsp;I share this example which was shared with me to show how infectious disease is and how difficult it can be to prevent spreading from a single case to affecting many more who live and work together. So, imagine how much more challenging in might be for projects with workers living in different accommodation or having to move between different sites, as is the case with many projects with main contractors and several layers of sub-contractors and specialist contractors. But we understand the concerns of companies and will work closely with the industry associations at firms to look at the requirements to ensure that they are practically implementable.</p><p>We are also providing training to help companies put in place safe management measures by offering a course for safe management offices or SMOs. In the month of June alone, BCA and SCAL will train close to 20,000 such officers. BCA will give priority to train SMOs for projects that are ready to start first. BCA is also ramping up capacity further through tech-enabled learning modules. So, please bear with us.</p><p>We know there is a lot of information that is being put out about COVID-19 related measures, sometimes from multiple Ministries and agencies, day after day. Given how fluid and dynamic the situation is, contractors have told us that they are sometimes confused, lost, overwhelmed.</p><p>To avoid the situation where companies do not know who to approach for information, BCA will be the point agency in Government or the one stop-shop front for all matters regarding construction restart. So, if companies have questions or concerns, whether about testing their workers or constructing new temporary quarters, they need to only approach BCA who will coordinate with other relevant agencies to make the necessary arrangements or seek the necessary approvals.</p><p>Because of the current situation, BCA has received a huge surge of calls, emails and queries, and we are ramping up our capabilities to better support our sector.</p><p>We understand that firms are very concerned about their finances during this period when the projects have yet to restart. Deputy Prime Minister announced during the Fortitude Budget speech that the construction sector will receive enhanced support under the job support scheme until August. And let me assure Er Dr Lee Bee Wah that similar to construction firms, the consultancy firms will also be eligible for the higher tier of 75% JSS support for wages paid between June and August this year.</p><p>In addition, companies whose foreign workers are not able to resume work will receive foreign worker levy waivers and rebates until July. Government has also announced rental offsets for qualifying SME tenants.&nbsp;</p><p>Even after construction projects restart, we recognise that firms have to bear additional costs to meet the new COVID requirements, which were not priced into the existing contracts. In the short term, the Government will help to bear the additional costs, including paying for the testing costs for workers. And in the long term, the Government will continue to support the construction industry and provide assistance to cope with the additional costs. We will share more details on the specific measures when we are ready.&nbsp;</p><p>We recognise the importance of the construction industry because without them, we would not have our homes, our schools, our hospitals and other services. So, we will do what we can to help as many companies as possible tide through this crisis.</p><p>And that is also why we have been working closely with our industry partners, such as a Singapore Contractors Association Limited (SCAL), the Specialists Trade Alliance of Singapore or STARS, and the Real Estate Developers\\' Association of Singapore or REDAS, to address the many issues that the industry is facing during this period. In fact, Minister of State Zaqy and I held a video conference meeting with them just two days ago. This was our third meeting in three weeks and we will continue to do so regularly.</p><p>I would like to thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Dr Teo Ho Pin for also joining us in the virtual meeting on Wednesday where there were many constructive suggestions raised. For example, SCAL had earlier provided feedback that there are some construction S Pass and work permit holders who do not live in dormitories, work only in offices and do not visit work sites. In consultation with MOH, we agreed to remove the regular testing requirement for this group of employees.</p><p>There was also feedback that a company had to approach several different agencies to obtain the necessary approval to build new temporary living quarters or to convert existing workplaces and factories into living quarters.&nbsp;BCA has since set up a one-stop platform to facilitate such approvals.&nbsp;Participants told us at these discussions which involve a number of Government agencies being brought together are useful and we will continue to coordinate closely and keep our lines of engagement with industry open.</p><p>Assoc Prof Walter Theseira spoke yesterday about our dependence on foreign workers, including in the construction sector. Let me say a few words about this.</p><p>Our efforts to raise productivity in the construction industry has been ongoing for decades. In line with the construction industry transformation map under the work of the Future Economic Council or FEC, we have indeed been working with industry to reduce our reliance on foreign workers. But this will require major structural changes to the industry and to how construction work is done. We have been pushing for greater adoption of technology, such as through design for manufacturing and assembly, building information modelling and digitisation of the sector from end to end.&nbsp;</p><p>This will, in turn, create higher skilled jobs, including many good jobs for Singaporeans. For example, with design for manufacturing and assembly or DFMA, we will need more production managers, quality assurance personnel and logistics and supply chain planners and automated production facilities. Even our foreign workers that take on such jobs will need to be higher skilled.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the construction sector will not be able to reduce our foreign worker reliance to zero as there will still be many lower skilled jobs in the sector that Singaporeans do not want to take up.&nbsp;We appreciate the contribution of our foreign guest workers who have come here to Singapore to make an honest living for themselves and their families and it is incumbent on us to also take care of them when they are unwell.</p><p>Sir, many firms in the construction sector, including many SMEs are very anxious about survival and about their future. Let me assure you that our main priority is to restart construction quickly but safely. We will coordinate amongst various agencies and lean forward to provide information to you and work closely with your industry associations and with you to resume construction as soon as we can and work together to transform our sector in the medium to long term.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.</p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Sir. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Minister Desmond Lee and Minister of State Zaqy for coming in to bring all parties together and trying to help contractors work through the process. And I am very heartened to hear the strong support that the Minister just mentioned given to the construction industry. Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I thought you had a clarification. But thank you anyway. Mr Mohamed Irshad.</p><h6>3.35 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I stand here today with mixed feelings. On one hand, I am relieved that the circuit breaker has officially ended. On the other hand, with no immediate end in sight to the COVID-19 battle, I am worried about what the next few months, rather years, have in store for Singapore and Singaporeans.</p><p>I speak for my generation and those young at heart when I say that there are many questions running through our minds. Are we in a grave situation? Yes, without a doubt. Have we faced a situation like this before? No, most certainly not. Have we been in a worse situation? Yes, we have in 1965. Are we facing an existential threat? No, we are not. Do we have what it takes to get through this and emerge stronger? Yes, I strongly and wholeheartedly believe so.</p><p>Sir, what gives me this confidence is that the Singapore story is replete with instances of major crises that have in some cases shaken us to the core. From a forced Independence to the communist threat to the racial riots to recessions to multiple global financial crises to even pandemics, we have come through it all. And it was those defining moments that have always brought the best out of our people.&nbsp;</p><p>As we deal with the immediate issues and pressing problems facing us, I remind myself, Members of this house and my fellow Singaporeans that COVID-19 is offering us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make seismic shifts in the way we have been doing things. This shall form the crux of my speech today.</p><p>First, responsibility to the nation. Second, the future of work. Third, digital transformation and innovation.</p><p>I begin by speaking on the theme of our responsibility to the nation. As parliamentarians, we are collectively responsible for our nation\\'s fiscal health. Mr Speaker, as I have previously mentioned in this House, one of the hallmarks of the Singapore brand is fiscal prudence pillared by accountability and responsibility. It is the reason why we are able to draw on our reserves and table an unprecedented four Budgets in four months.</p><p>Sir, during our Unity Budget debates earlier this year, several Members of this House raised questions about the continued health of our National Investment Returns Contributions (NIRC), which are now the largest contributor to the Government\\'s coffers. In addition to COVID-19, we continue to face long-term pressures such as the geopolitical tensions between America and China, stagnating growth and more nationalist and protectionist tendencies around the world. Given that our reserves form the basis of our NIRC revenue, what is the projected revenue impact of this large drawdown? Additionally, how long do we expect this to last?</p><p>Mr Speaker, I must point out that the first and only previous instance when we had to dip into our reserves was in 2009. Then, when faced with a fast deteriorating global economic environment and the prospect of a deep and prolonged recession, the House drew down on S$4.9 billion from past reserves. And they only used S$4.9 billion. And a mere two years later, the amount drawn was returned back to the reserves in 2011. Today, Sir, we are drawing over 10 times more than what we drew in 2009. We owe it to our future generations to safeguard their future as our forefathers have done so for us. My third question thus echoes the concerns which I heard in this Chamber yesterday. Can the Deputy Prime Minister share his plans to return the money drawn back to our reserves in the years to come?</p><p>&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, we must not be lulled into a false sense of security that our reserves are unlimited. Consequently, we cannot afford to be complacent in how the money is being spent. Even as Deputy Prime Minister has assured us that the Public Accounts Committee has been scrutinising Government\\'s expenditure, we need to instill a mindset of \"active audit\" to ensure that funds channeled for the various schemes and projects are indeed being spent wisely.</p><p>Mr Speaker, this brings me to my second theme on the future of work. This crisis is an opportunity for us to re-imagine work. At various times, this House has debated the importance of improving our work-life balance and having a more sustainable way of life. Sir, this is our moment.&nbsp;</p><p>Our experience over the last three months has shown that being present in the office and having face-to-face meetings is not absolutely necessary for many of us. Members of this House and fellow Singaporeans will be surprised to know that the SGUnited Buka Puasa initiative involving multiple Government agencies, private companies and community organisations was conceptualised, planned and operationalised virtually, without even a single physical meeting. And I am sure there are many other such projects.</p><p>We have, within a very short period of time, adapted to working through video conferencing, private messaging, emails and even the good old fashion phone calls. To quote the CEO of a leading software firm, COVID-19 has resulted in two years of digital transformation in just two months. We need to build upon this rather than going back to old ways. It is time that we reconsider a new model for our companies. Allow me to offer some solutions and suggestions.&nbsp;</p><p>First, as we reopen the economy, we have to fundamentally rethink future job arrangements. I propose moving away from the traditional five-day work week to a four-day work week with the option of working from home on the fifth day and even having a flexi-hours work model. Established companies like Microsoft have demonstrated that a four-day work week can increase productivity by up to 40%. Twitter\\'s CEO recently announced that it will allow its employees to work from home \"forever\". In New Zealand, a four-day work week to promote better work life balance and domestic tourism as a means to help the economy is being considered. As the Government prepares for Phase Two, we should re-evaluate our traditional model of work.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, I hope that after COVID-19, telecommuting will not disappear but will be a more permanent feature. As the Government prepares to work with our companies to begin the job creation process, it is incumbent on us to incentivise the creation of jobs which will allow telecommuting. In doing so, we will no longer exclude those who may be unable to work in a traditional nine-to-five environment for various reasons.</p><p>President Halimah recently said, and I quote, \"Imagine how many more women with young children could remain in the workforce if they could telecommute. Imagine the kind of skills and talents among women that we could retain to benefit our society and economy. With dual income families more of a necessity today, we should make it easier for women with family obligations to work.\" Mr Speaker, it is not just women with care-giving duties who will benefit from this arrangement but many more.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, I came across a very moving commentary by Mr Jonathan Tiong, a fourth year student from NUS. He is a disabled person who will soon be entering the workforce. Being a wheelchair user, one of the biggest obstacles he faced was travel, which he defined as the mere act of leaving his home. Unlike an able-bodied person, he cannot just get up and go wherever he wants. The logistics of transport invariably involves at least one other person for him. He shared from his personal experience that video conferencing will help disabled persons and people with disabilities to integrate better into society by allowing them to lead more active professional and social lives.&nbsp;</p><p>In creating openings and retaining these segments of the population in the workforce, we can then create a workforce that is not only fair to all but also ensure that we maximise our potential to the fullest. I am confident that the National Jobs Council helmed by Senior Minister Tharman will also look into this matter.</p><p>On digital transformation and innovation, since 2014, the Smart Nation initiative has been quietly transforming and enriching the lives of many Singaporeans. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2019, Deputy Prime Minister stated that Singapore needs to work towards repositioning itself to becoming a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise.</p><p>As we restart our economy, the importance of the Smart Nation initiative and the words of Deputy Prime Minister cannot be more true. To ride the new wave, we need our people to be digitally enabled in every sense of the word. What this means is that in addition to the various aspects of citizenry, we need Singaporeans to not only be IT-savvy but also be responsible digital citizens or digitizens.</p><p>This pandemic has taught us how under-prepared many were for a global crisis that affected all countries. It has also brought to the forefront the need for digital acceleration and the importance of business continuity plans for businesses and organisations of all sizes. In this regard, there is a vital need for a one-stop digital acceleration centre of excellence that can provide seamless solutions for companies and organisations seeking to ride the coming wave.</p><p>Mr Speaker, a digital economy cannot be the exclusive purview of the rich. Singaporeans living in rental flats and those in the lower income brackets are disproportionately less likely to have wifi at home. In fact, in the last three months, we have seen regular media coverage about the struggles that some of these families face trying to ensure that their children can participate in home-based learning. I understand that MSF has plans to proactively reach out to these Singaporeans with a helping hand. The existing Digital Inclusion framework needs to be reinforced so that no one gets left behind causing a digital divide. I urge MCI and IMDA to redouble their efforts in distributing internet connected devices, and work to ensure that affordable wifi is available to residents living in our rental flats.</p><p>I would also like to express my support and commend MCI and IMDA for launching the Seniors Go Digital Movement. It is timely and crucial to also include our seniors in our Digitalisation journey. Beyond family, friends and the wider community, our model of constantly creating public-private partnerships should not be forgotten. Mr Speaker, I hope that MCI and IMDA will collaborate and work with various tech companies as we continue to ensure our seniors are not left behind.</p><p>On innovation, Harvard Business School professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter said, “Change is a threat when done to me, but an opportunity when done by me.” In my many conversations with fellow Singaporeans over the circuit breaker period, I have come to realise that many of them are embodying a key trait: adaptability through innovation. Let me illustrate this through the lens of our response to this crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When we announced the circuit breaker, we had to adapt to a completely new way of life. Parents had to learn how to work from home while supervising their children in home-based learning. Teachers had to transition to teaching the entire syllabus online. Businesses had to learn how to continue operating without access to their paper documents or any in person interaction. Sir, the crisis forced us to be adaptable. No one was spared from the need to change their way of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Out of this disorientation came the spirit of innovation. We have innovated by adopting video conferencing tools to conduct meetings and even marriages! Our food establishments have innovated by serving their patrons without any physical interaction. Even our wet-markets were not spared. Our civil servants had to innovate as well. The SafeEntry declaration that I scanned today and the TraceTogether app which is running on my phone right now are all concrete examples of innovation driven by our teams at GovTech.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, this adaptability through innovation has ensured that our country can continue to function.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic is the latest in a long list of crises that have hit the world in recent times. It has exposed our fragilities and the urgent need to rethink our way forward. The multi-faceted crisis the world is faced with did reveal itself in various ways in the last decades, continuously sending us signals on the urgent necessity to take action and embark on a transformational journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the history of humanity, crises have always represented critical junctures allowing mankind to take the path of innovation and positive transformation that contributed to building better societies. The COVID-19 pandemic should be no exception. We stand at the threshold of history to build a healthier, more peaceful, prosperous, inclusive, resilient and sustainable society in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, it behooves me to embrace the spirit of the Singapore Together Movement which has been labelled \"a cornerstone\" of nation building by Deputy Prime Minister as we beat the odds together. With that, I support the Budget.&nbsp;Majulah, Singapura. It is a privilege to serve.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Vikram Nair.</p><h6>3.49 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>: Mr Speaker, when we started this financial year, we had a long debate over the Unity Budget, which was the largest Budget in Singapore’s history, amounting to around $105 billion.&nbsp;This Budget provided what seemed to be a very generous sum of $5 billion to deal with the effects of COVID-19.&nbsp;At this time, the number of cases in Singapore was less than 200 and the epicentre of the crisis was still very much in China, with the largest number of cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Within a month, the situation changed dramatically, as COVID-19 spread around the world, and became particularly rampant in Europe and the US, the number of cases in Singapore started spiking as well as we had more people return from overseas.&nbsp;The Government moved swiftly and Deputy Prime Minister Heng announced the Resilience Budget, which was what we needed in light of the worsening situation and the additional restrictions that the Government had to put in place to reduce the spread of the virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As the number of cases continued to grow with more and more Singaporeans returning home, the danger of wide community spread emerged and the Government decided to implement the circuit breaker.&nbsp;To tide over the circuit breaker, Deputy Prime Minister announced a third Budget, the Solidarity Budget – solidarity because most Singaporeans, apart from our essential workers, stayed at home to prevent this crisis spreading.&nbsp;Workplaces and schools closed and people tried to work from home while students engaged in home-based learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With the circuit breaker coming to an end, and with Singapore cautiously opening up, this latest Budget, is aptly named \"Fortitude\" and it aims to help get us moving once again in a very uncertain and volatile world.&nbsp;Even as we have this debate today, the world is a different place.&nbsp;Air travel has all but frozen.&nbsp;The Causeway, which used to see a little under half a million people a day cross up and down, is also quiet, allowing only vehicles with essential supplies coming through.&nbsp;The largest number of COVID-19 cases now is in America, which also has an added crisis as the tragic death of George Lloyd has triggered a “Black Lives Matter” with large numbers of people on the street.</p><p>The Singapore Government’s approach in this virus has been nimble.&nbsp;We did not create this crisis, but we have to deal with the fallout.&nbsp;We prioritised the saving of lives with a rigorous system of public messaging, contact tracing, quarantine and the expansion of medical resources.&nbsp;Although we have one of the largest numbers of cases in Asia, which is partly because we have done very aggressive testing, we have managed to keep our fatality rates low because our medical capacity is adequate to provide for all who need it.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ministerial Task Force has communicated regularly, acted decisively and flexibly, staying calm and always having a clear plan for the situation.&nbsp;This Budget, the Fortitude Budget, is the latest additional spending the Government needs and I whole-heartedly support this.&nbsp;Fortitude means courage in the face of adversity and that is exactly what Singapore needs to get back on its feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The earlier Budgets, particularly the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets, helped businesses stay afloat during a time when Singapore and much of the world was frozen.&nbsp;Our people retained jobs even though many were staying at home and were not able to work.&nbsp;Those who were not so fortunate and lost jobs or income received immediate support.&nbsp;This helped our people have resilience and solidarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the time has come to slowly get back on our feet and move and this Budget again provides much needed lubrication to help this process.&nbsp;For businesses, the three main concerns are usually payroll, rental and financing.&nbsp;This Budget has provisions for all three.&nbsp;In relation to payroll, the extension of the Jobs Support Scheme means that many employers, particularly those in troubled sectors like aviation, will continue to get significant payroll support for their staff, up to 75% through to August.&nbsp;Rental waivers of two to four months will be enjoyed by many businesses, the load shared between landlords and the Government.&nbsp;Landlords in turn can get relief from their own mortgage obligations if they need it.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, for many businesses, credit is the lifeblood and the previous Budgets had provided Temporary Bridging Loan Programme and Enterprise Financing Scheme, both of which provided access to credit.&nbsp;These well thought through schemes mitigate the three greatest concerns businesses will have and will, hopefully, give them fortitude to get up and get back in the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For individuals, particularly those who have lost jobs or income, there is also significant help.&nbsp;The biggest concern for individuals who are out of work is \"Will we get more income? And when will we get our next job?\" This Budget provides for both apart from those with high incomes or higher value properties. Whether you are self-employed or an employee, if you have lost 30% or more of your income, there will be relief.&nbsp;In addition to this, payments to families from Care and Support packages in previous Budgets will continue and this will help households meet expenses. There is also significant investment in job creation and training opportunities, with a bold plan to create 100,000 jobs and the team is already in place headed by Senior Minister Tharman to look into this very difficult project.&nbsp;These are exactly what we need during these difficult times.</p><p>All this spending comes with a price tag, and in this case, we will, for the first time in our history, be dipping into our reserves to the tune of around $50 billion.&nbsp;This is significant, but it is also clear that this is not a decision the Government is taking lightly.&nbsp;Based on what we know from MOF’s public data, the reserves managed by MAS are around $400 billion and Temasek has more than $300 billion on its balance sheet.&nbsp;The full figure is, of course, bigger than this.&nbsp;</p><p>Against this backdrop, a one off draw-down of $50 billion to deal with what is probably the biggest financial crisis since our Independence is probably justified.&nbsp;</p><p>We must however be mindful that these reserves built up since our Independence are our “Golden Goose”, and the more we spend of the reserves, the less the net investment income will be. The last time we drew down on these reserves was during the 2008/2009 Global Financial Crisis. Back then we had a \"V\" shape recovery and the Government was able to pay back the draw-down within a year. I do not expect the Government to be able to do so this time.&nbsp;Yet, given the extraordinary situation we are in, I think this expenditure is well justified.&nbsp;I support this Budget.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I’ll continue in Tamil.</p><p>(<em>In Tamil</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-Mr Vikram Nair, Take 24, 3.45-4.00 pm, 5 June 2020 (Tamil).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>This is a time of unprecedented challenges for the world from COVID-19. Many of our friends in other countries are facing unprecedented hardship and suffering, including being unable to find hospital beds and treatment when they need it and watching loved ones die without being able to be with them in their final moments or attend their funerals.</p><p>In Singapore, we have faced pain too. Although we have a large number of cases, because we have managed the situation, our death rate from COVID-19 is one of the lowest in the world. Now people’s main concern is their livelihoods, and that is exactly what this Budget addresses.</p><p>For those who own businesses, there is support for payroll, relief from rental and financing available. For individuals who have lost jobs and income, there is financial assistance available as well as training to get new jobs.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Deputy Prime Minister.</p><h6>4.21 pm</h6><p><strong>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members of this House for their support and participation at this debate on our Fortitude Budget. Members have spent many hours raising many points, so it would not be possible for me to respond to each and every one of their points. But where there are good ideas, the various Ministries will take them up and my various colleagues will address these later.</p><p>In rounding up this debate, let me start by sharing my perspective on the nature of this crisis and the global and historical context.</p><p>COVID-19 is a global crisis of our generation. Within six months, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the coronavirus has infected 6.4 million people, claimed over 380,000 lives, disrupted lives and livelihoods, and closed borders worldwide.&nbsp;Never before have we seen a global lockdown of this scale. The pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains, accelerated digitalisation and technological changes, and fragmented global markets.&nbsp;There is huge uncertainty on both the health and economic fronts. In fact, it has opened up other fronts.</p><p>The trigger of this crisis – the coronavirus – will continue to disrupt lives until a vaccine or suitable therapeutics are developed.</p><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects the global economy to contract sharply by 3 percentage points. This is much worse than the 0.07% contraction during the global financial crisis and is unseen since the Great Depression. There are serious cascading effects on employment and people all over the world.&nbsp;This comes amidst escalating geo-strategic competition between the US and China, which could destabilise the global order.&nbsp;</p><p>COVID-19 is having a huge impact on the global economy because it shocked both the demand and supply side of the economy simultaneously.&nbsp;On the demand side, reduced social interactions and weakened consumer confidence have significantly reduced consumption which, in turn, reduced income and investment levels. On the supply side, global lockdowns have disrupted deeply integrated supply chains across borders and slowed global trade and investment.</p><p>These shocks reinforce each other and threaten to impair the long-term productive capacity of economies. Measures that depend primarily on stimulating demand in the economy will not work due to supply chain disruptions.</p><p>Ms Denise Phua and several other Members of Parliament asked about the global outlook.&nbsp;The road to recovery will be long as we deal with persistent economic impact on workers, jobs and business. Beyond economic costs, there will be immense human and social costs.&nbsp;</p><p>The world took eight to 10 years following the Great Depression and global financial crisis to recover to pre-crisis unemployment levels. We should not be surprised that it takes as long, if not longer, to bounce back from the effects of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>The First World War had a lasting impact on the employment prospects of a lost generation of youth in western economies, stripping them of a sense of hope and direction. There is now talk of a global \"lockdown generation\" and fears that the youths of our time could have their skills, employability and incomes permanently affected even after the world recovers from the pandemic. We must work to prevent a \"COVID-19 generation\" of workers and students in Singapore.</p><p>All over the world, we have seen a Catch-22 situation developing as governments grapple with the tensions between saving lives and livelihoods. The reluctance to freeze activities due to heavy economic losses has had tragic consequences. Delayed and incomplete measures to stem infections resulted in a massive number of casualties as healthcare systems were overwhelmed.&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore has managed to avert some of the harsher outcomes from COVID-19. We were able to act boldly as Singaporeans stood in unity, trusted the Government and worked together to save lives and livelihoods.&nbsp;We imposed a prolonged circuit breaker to significantly reduce the community transmission rates over the past two months. We set up a joint task force to deal with the situation among our migrant worker community and the situation is improving. Aggressive testing and the professional dedication of our healthcare team have kept fatalities low.</p><p>Our battle against COVID-19 has reached an inflection point. We have now taken the first steps to reopen our economy safely, in a gradual and systematic way. We are now four days into our phased reopening. If infection rates remain low and stable, we expect large parts of the economy to be able to reopen by the end of June. We will continue to provide support for our workers and businesses to tide through this period.&nbsp;</p><p>Internationally, we are working to gradually reopen our borders safely with other countries. This will allow for business travel, which is essential for our open economy. The Singapore-China \"fast lane\" is a first step in this reopening of borders.</p><p>Around the world, many countries have started to reopen and we are watching them closely. They, too, have taken a phased approach.</p><p>When infection cases slowed to a trickle, China started to reopen in late April, and South Korea, Germany and Japan relaxed their lockdown in May. France did so this week. Infection rates rose for some countries that reopened earlier but they are actively managing the situation and working hard to respond to the new infections.</p><p>We are dealing with a highly infectious and agile virus. The world is learning on the go. So, we must be psychologically prepared that infections could rise somewhat, even with the best precautionary measures.</p><p>We are thus not reopening and going back to our familiar routines but into a new uncertain reality. Singaporeans must learn and adapt to the new reality. We must adjust to new norms, such as higher standards of personal and public hygiene, safe distancing and reduced social contact. We will need to adjust to new ways of working, such as telecommuting, and acquire new skills relevant in the new economy. Changing habits is difficult but we must all do our best.</p><p>Government interventions have become the cornerstone of the COVID-19 response as populations look towards the one institution that can organise and mobilise. There has been a flight to leadership. Administrations, regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum or their belief in government intervention, have responded with substantial support packages. Some have also stepped in to support distressed corporates from airlines to car makers.</p><p>We, too, have mounted a strong response because lives and livelihoods are at stake. We are committing almost $100 billion, or close to 20% of our GDP, to our COVID-19 response. Adding the COVID-19 response to our usual spending, the total size of our four Budgets stands at $193 billion. This is more than double the size of our annual Budgets in preceding years. In other words, we are looking to spend in one year what we would have done in two years or more in normal times. This is a very big commitment!</p><p>Beyond the size of headline numbers, what matters even more is whether resources are directed to the right areas, to enable our people and our economy to rebound faster and stronger. Design and implementation are critical. The measures in our four Budgets have been designed to not only respond to the crisis but to also enable Singapore to emerge stronger. The measures aim to protect lives and livelihoods, deal with immediate concerns and build for our future.</p><p>Our Budgets aim to:</p><p>(a) minimise the spread of the virus and risk to lives, which has largely been successful;</p><p>(b) stabilise the economy, save jobs and viable companies, and protect livelihoods;</p><p>(c) reposition workers, businesses and the community to respond to major shifts; and</p><p>(d) seize new opportunities so as to emerge stronger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have put our people at the centre of our Budgets. Our measures on protecting livelihoods centre on helping people to stay employed and businesses to stay viable. The fortunes of workers and businesses are intertwined.&nbsp;By keeping the economy stable, we strengthen social resilience. By investing in upgrading the skills of our people and transforming our businesses, the economy can recover more strongly.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why over $72 billion, or close to 80% of the amount set aside for the COVID-19 response, is committed to helping our workers stay in their jobs, and supporting our businesses and their employees, which, in turn, support social resilience.&nbsp;As our Labour Movement firmly believes&nbsp;– a job is the best welfare.&nbsp;The remaining goes to public health and social support measures, to supplement and strengthen the significant investments made and structural measures already in place.&nbsp;</p><p>Having set out the global context, let me now respond to the various issues raised in the Budget debate, under three broad themes:&nbsp;</p><p>First, supporting jobs, livelihoods and our future economy;</p><p>Second, maintaining a strong fiscal position; and</p><p>Third, drawing on our deep reserves of social capital.</p><p>Let me start with jobs and livelihoods, which many Members of Parliament spoke about. This has, indeed, been the focus of our Budgets.</p><p>COVID-19 will take a lasting toll on the quantity and quality of jobs worldwide, despite countries\\' best efforts to mitigate the impact. The International Labour Organisation has estimated that COVID-19 could raise global unemployment numbers by \"far higher\" than 25 million. This is worse than the 2009 Global Financial Crisis, which saw additional global unemployment of some 22 million workers. For Singapore, the highest annual average number of unemployed residents on record was registered during the 2003 SARS epidemic, at 91,000 unemployed residents. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is widely expected to be more severe than SARS, with the number of unemployed residents potentially rising from around 73,000 in 2019 to above 100,000 in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The economic fallout of COVID-19 goes beyond unemployment numbers. Even those who keep their jobs may suffer under-employment and significant income loss. This could lead to a vicious cycle where income loss reduces consumption and affected businesses further reduce labour demand. The human and social effects of unemployment and under-employment are no less debilitating. For many of us, having a job means more than getting paid. Through our jobs, we are connected to the workings of the world and to other people, and we take pride in being a contributing member of society. At a personal level, losing a job can lead to a loss of identity, confidence and dignity.</p><p>This is why, when COVID-19 struck, our top priority is to provide fiscal resources to help workers stay in their jobs. The SGUnited Jobs and Skills package seeks to not only grow pathways to jobs, but also equip workers and their firms with capabilities for the coming years.&nbsp;Our Labour Movement is a key partner. I thank Secretary-General Mr Ng Chee Meng and Deputy Secretaries-General Mr Heng Chee How and Dr Koh Poh Koon for NTUC\\'s unwavering support and partnership during these uncertain times, and all our NTUC colleagues who have spoken on behalf of workers in this House. Indeed, every worker matters!</p><p>Our Jobs and Skills Package goes hand-in-hand with transformation in every business and at the industry level, through our Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs). Every business that is confronted with structural changes and the shocks from COVID-19 will need to take a long hard look at its business model. They will need new markets, new products, or process innovations, and need to harness new technologies. They may need to work with their competitors as industries consolidate for scale. I am glad that many of our business leaders understand more than ever we cannot take the \"business as usual\" or BAU attitude, or else there will be no business left.</p><p>Existing jobs will need to be re-designed. New good jobs will be created in growth areas. How do businesses get the right people into these re-designed or new jobs?&nbsp;By hiring the right people and building up their skills. Fresh graduates or mid-career individuals with experience from other sectors are good choices. So are existing staff who can be re-skilled. Business transformation, creating and sustaining good jobs need to be done as part of a coherent business and industry transformation plan. Dr Koh Poh Koon shared many examples of how the Labour Movement has partnered and supported businesses through their transformation journeys.</p><p>There are three thrusts to our Jobs and Skills Package.</p><p>First, we will save jobs in viable businesses and preserve workforce capability in sectors which are temporarily hard-hit. The Jobs Support Scheme, which I have enhanced over the four Budgets, will flow a total of $23.5 billion to support 1.9 million jobs over 10 months. Close to two-thirds of these jobs are in our SMEs. Over $11 billion has already gone out to help employers defray wage costs.</p><p>I am heartened to hear that many businesses have found the support useful and have factored it into their decision to retain jobs and workers. Let me be clear, so people understand. The Jobs Support Scheme is what its name says clearly&nbsp;– it is meant to support jobs. We are not supporting businesses for their own sakes. We are supporting businesses – defraying their wage costs – so that they can retain and pay workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, we will open up pathways to new jobs across a range of skills levels and help local jobseekers of all ages and profiles to access them. As Minister Josephine Teo explained, we will create about 100,000 opportunities to help local jobseekers take on new jobs, including in emerging and growth areas, such as infocomm technologies, financial services and healthcare.&nbsp;</p><p>I thank Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam for agreeing to chair the National Jobs Council to oversee this major effort to keep jobs and help people bounce back should they become unemployed. The Council had a productive first meeting just two days ago. Again, I stress the effort we are making is unprecedented. Never before in our history have we set out to preserve so many jobs as well as create so many new opportunities – 100,000. The Council has already begun its task.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I also encourage our workers to step out of their comfort zone and acquire new skills to prepare for the structural changes ahead. For example, Mr Goo Chong Kiat embarked on a Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) as a Senior Engineer with Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Company during the Circuit Breaker, as he wanted to deepen his skills in areas of Industry 4.0. His advice to others enrolling in PCPs is to keep an open mind and be ready to adapt to a dynamic environment. I cannot agree more!</p><p>Third, we are dedicating additional help to groups which are harder hit, including our graduating students, our mid-career workers and self-employed persons. As Mr Ang Hin Kee, Mr Desmond Choo, Ms Jessica Tan and Prof Lim Sun Sun have pointed out, we need concerted efforts to support these groups. I also thank Mr Pritam Singh for his support. Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad covered many of the initiatives in his speech earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>Our fresh job entrants will get enhanced access to jobs and traineeship opportunities in growth areas, through the TechSkills Accelerator programmes mentioned by Minister Iswaran yesterday. Our public agencies are also stepping up efforts to help. Mr Muhammad Syabil Bin Mohamed Sazali is a fresh graduate from NUS Computer Engineering. This July, he will enroll in the Cyber Security Agency\\'s 18-month Cybersecurity Development Programme. Syabil will be amongst the first batch of 40 officers to be groomed as cybersecurity professionals. With widespread digitalisation, demand for cybersecurity professionals will grow.</p><p>Mature workers will receive strong support from the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package and enhancements to the Adapt and Grow programmes introduced at the Unity Budget. Mr Chew Kok Poh was an Operations Executive with ST Logistics for close to 19 years. With the deployment of Automated Guided Vehicles and a Warehouse Management System, his role was significantly transformed as a large portion of warehouse operation processes became automated. ST Logistics leveraged the WSG redeployment PCP to upskill Kok Poh for the enhanced Logistics Executive role. He now works with the new automation systems to manage warehouse operations and conducts data analysis to plan their weekly manpower resources.</p><p>I appreciate Mr Heng Chee How\\'s support for our schemes to give our mature workers a leg up in the workplace. We are now encouraging employers to re-design jobs as part of their broader enterprise transformation efforts through the Enterprise Development Grant, the Productivity Solutions Grant – Job Redesign, and the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. By pegging the Hiring Incentive for eligible mature jobseekers at 40%, which is double the rate for that of younger workers, we are helping more mature workers to find new employers. Many seniors can and want to work longer. We will continue to support them through the Senior Worker Support Package.&nbsp;</p><p>I join Minister Josephine Teo and Secretary-General Ng Chee Meng in thanking the many firms which have already stepped forward to play their part in supporting the creation of good job pathways. Banks, both local and foreign, are grooming the local talent pipeline, by pledging to offer close to 900 traineeships for local fresh graduates and jobseekers. Mr Seah Kian Peng also spoke about the support from NTUC FairPrice and Enterprise Groups, which have offered some 4,000 jobs and 300 traineeships. I encourage more businesses to think long-term and continue to invest in people, or what economists call human capital development. Skilled workers make strong firms and strong firms create good jobs. Every business, every worker, must seek to maximise this synergy.</p><p>But, despite our best efforts, we cannot possibly save every job. Many sectors were already facing disruptions before COVID-19. For workers who are displaced, you have our assurance that if you make the effort, our tripartite partners will support you to tide through this difficulty.&nbsp;</p><p>Before COVID-19 struck, structural changes, such as the fragmentation of global supply chains and technological changes, were already in motion.&nbsp;COVID-19 has triggered both a deep cyclical shock and accelerating structural changes in the global economy. To thrive, or even to survive, companies all around the world must adjust to these forces with speed and agility.</p><p>In Singapore, we are fortunate that we started our structural transformation efforts early and companies that have made the efforts are adapting better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, we set up the Committee on the Future Economy.&nbsp;The Committee charted strategies to build our capacity for a vibrant, strong future economy and to create good opportunities for our people. From 2016, we launched our Industry Transformation Maps to systematically bring together stakeholders to transform our industries, across all 23 sectors and six industry clusters.</p><p>Some business leaders have told us that by embarking on transformation early, they have found it easier to pivot to new areas of opportunity. One example is Forefront Medical, a precision engineering firm providing manufacturing services to the medical industry. Prior to COVID-19, Forefront Medical had started building up automation capabilities, adding cleanroom capacity and growing its local medtech talent pool. These capabilities enabled the company to supply to more global medical companies when the pandemic struck. Forefront Medical also managed to pivot into the diagnostics space by acquiring capabilities in reagent manufacturing for COVID-19 test kits. It has already secured a deal with one test kit company and is in discussion with two more.</p><p>Last week, I had an e-conference with a group of start-ups and venture funds in Singapore. The progress that they all have made in seizing new opportunities cheered me, including the safe bicycle helmet, 3D printing of instruments for swab tests and telemedicine. In the interest of time, let me just share a few more examples, to give a flavour of the progress.&nbsp;</p><p>And the first flavor is Shiok Meats, a start-up working to harvest crustacean meats from cells instead of animals, thereby eliminating the risk of food-borne diseases. It aims to introduce these alternative proteins grown in food manufacturing facilities to restaurants in the next two years.</p><p>Novade provides smart field management software for the building and construction industry. Since COVID-19 struck, Novade has launched new functionalities to enable health monitoring procedures on work sites and is now helping clients use these functions to restart and carry out operations safely.</p><p>ViSenze specialises in retail AI solutions, including virtual try-outs of products using a real-time camera recognition function. It has been piloting these new technologies with retailers to get ready for a \"new normal\" in post COVID-19 shopping and is now doubling down its efforts to help retail clients worldwide transform their operations.</p><p>The start-up mantra is to disrupt the world, to make it better.&nbsp;But with COVID-19 disrupting the world, it is good to see start-ups pivoting to enabling us to cope better with a disrupted world, with the right innovations!&nbsp;</p><p>In the face of the deep uncertainties that confront the world today, what must Singapore do to survive and succeed?</p><p>The post COVID-19 world will be different from today. We may not know the exact contours of how this world will look like, but we know the forces that are shaping it.&nbsp;</p><p>The Emerging Stronger Task Force, led by Minister Desmond Lee and PSA International Group CEO Tan Chong Meng, are studying key shifts and developing recommendations in the areas of technology and innovation, digitalisation and disruption to global supply chains.&nbsp;</p><p>In the course of its work, the Task force will consult multiple stakeholders and draw on insights beyond its membership, so that their findings and recommendations are relevant.</p><p>&nbsp;Many Members spoke about the need to respond quickly to the structural shifts, and I thank Members, including Mr Ang Wei Neng, Miss Cheryl Chan and Mr Douglas Foo for their insights. Accelerating our economic transformation is indeed a national priority and both workers and employers must do their part to stay focused on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our Fortitude Budget not only cushions firms to tide over immediate cashflow, cost and credit challenges that Members, including Mr Darryl David and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah spoke about, but also helps accelerate digital transformation and build capabilities to emerge stronger when the recovery comes. Minister Iswaran sets out clearly that this crisis has crystallised the need and opportunity for digitalisation and we can only emerge stronger by making a decisive push towards a digital future. And as Mr Christopher de Souza puts it, riding this wave of digitalisation is key to ensuring that our Singaporeans are ready for borderless job opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>There will also be a premium on resilience. As Mr Arasu Duraisamy, Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Saktiandi Supaat pointed out, one way for businesses to build resilience, is to build up a strong Singaporean Core. This will not only create opportunities for our local workers but also help our businesses continue to operate sustainably even as other economies grow and develop, or even if there are disruptions to external labour supply.</p><p>In our next phase of growth, we must anchor Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise. Like a pearl that is part of a strand of vital global nodes across the world, we must play a valued and inextricable role in the new global configuration. We will do so by forging new partnerships and bringing new value to the world through innovation and deep capabilities, including technological capabilities. I am bringing together the work of our Future Economy Council and the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council to do so, by enabling our industry clusters to harness the rich opportunities catalysed by innovation networks and the creation of new scientific knowledge. And as Assoc Prof Walter Theseira said, we must undertake this great exercise of economic restructuring together, as equal partners and as one people, in the creation of a new Singapore.</p><p>The COVID-19 situation is a mighty storm that has damaged sails and forced ships around the world to go into harbour. While waiting for the storm to subside, we must make the best use of this downtime to build new strengths and capabilities.&nbsp;Let us take this rare chance to repair, upgrade our ship and install new instruments, re-orientate our mental compass and strengthen our sailors, so that when the fair wind comes, we will sail out faster and further than ever before. This is what our four Budgets enable us to do – let us make the best use of these!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I have explained our immediate priorities to support jobs and livelihoods and why we need to accelerate transformation. Let me now respond to Members\\' comments on our approach to fund such measures through our four Budgets.&nbsp;</p><p>I thank many Members for recognising that Singapore\\'s fiscal response has been timely, comprehensive and decisive, and that it is commensurate with the widespread and unprecedented impact of the crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>Our strong response is projected to stabilise economic activity during this difficult period, and position Singapore for recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on a recent study by MAS, our four Budgets are estimated to help our economy avert an average output loss of five percentage points, or $23.4 billion per year, over 2020 and 2021. This is very significant because when&nbsp;you have a higher base, future growth, even at the same percentage rate, means that you reach a higher level.</p><p>As Mr Alex Yam mentioned, some are of the view that we have spent too much, while others think it is too little. These contrasting views show that crisis budgeting is anything but straightforward.</p><p>These decisions have been made after careful deliberations, based on the best information available at that time. As the COVID-19 situation develops, we have continued to enhance and refine our schemes, as evidenced by our four Budgets. Even then, let us stay vigilant – as I said at the outset, we are facing unprecedented levels of uncertainty across various fronts.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Liang Eng Hwa, in opening the debate, highlighted a distinctive feature of the Fortitude Budget – that we are setting aside an additional $13 billion in the Contingencies Funds. Such contingency budgeting reflects both the unprecedented levels of severity, as well as uncertainty, of this crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Liang asked if the Government can provide an indication of how the Funds may potentially be used. As designed, the Contingencies Funds can be drawn upon if there is a need to do so. And as designed, we have not designated specific purposes for the Funds. In sizing it, we have run some \"what if\" scenarios, including the possibility that we may experience a setback in our fight against COVID-19 or the global economy does much worse than currently expected.&nbsp;</p><p>So, unlike our usual annual Budget, where we seek to provide as much details as possible, we are setting aside a sum to meet future events or circumstances that are possible, but for which we cannot yet predict with certainty. This is indeed a special feature that allow us to respond swiftly to unforeseen developments. I thank Mr Liang for pointing this out.</p><p>Mr Pritam Singh asked about the governance around the use of Contingencies Funds. The use of Contingencies Funds is not new. Each year, we have $3 billion in the Contingencies Funds to meet urgent and unforeseen needs. With greater uncertainty, it is natural for us to cater for a bigger quantum. The Singapore Constitution includes safeguards over its use.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the Government will need to seek President\\'s concurrence for drawing down the Contingencies Funds. Second, these drawdowns must be replaced through a subsequent Supplementary Supply Bill or a Final Supply Bill that have to be presented to and voted on by Parliament before seeking President\\'s assent. This provides additional checks and balances over new spending from the Contingencies Funds will continue to ensure judicious use of the Contingencies Funds for urgent and unforeseen needs. When the uncertainty subsides, we can reduce the amount set aside in the Contingencies Funds.&nbsp;</p><p>Several Members have also pointed out another exceptional feature of our Budgets this Financial Year – the draw on Past Reserves. For most countries, borrowing is the only way to fund their largest stimulus packages. This increases the risk of unsustainable debt financing, which has severe consequences for the economy in the long run.</p><p>Countries that have taken on significant additional debt to pay for their support measures will have to find new ways to repay their debt and interest accrued. Future generations will be required to shoulder this debt, be it in the form of higher taxes, higher inflation, or lower returns on their retirement assets. Future generations will also be affected in other ways. In order to service debt repayment, there will be less fiscal room to invest in human capital or infrastructure. The \"Lockdown Generation\" in these countries will end up paying for this crisis a long way down the road.&nbsp;</p><p>We are fortunate that in this hour of crisis, we have our national reserves to depend on. Our reserves allow us to deal with this crisis from a position of strength and give us options in a period of uncertainty like this. Our reserves are our rainy-day fund. Mr Vikram Nair likened our reserves to a \"Golden Goose\", painstakingly built up since our Independence.&nbsp;</p><p>As Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Murali Pillai have pointed out, our reserves are our key strategic advantage in the current environment.&nbsp;</p><p>First, it assures Singaporeans that we have the means to navigate the challenges ahead, to protect our lives and to sustain our livelihoods. Second, it fosters confidence in global investors, that our economic fundamentals are sound and stable in the long term and that we have enough resources to emerge stronger from the crisis. Third, it protects us during this period of flux. Detractors and speculators know well enough not to take advantage of this crisis, to attack our economy or currency.</p><p>We did not get here by chance or good fortune. We have designed and implemented policies that discourage waste or over-consumption. We have run our public services based on outcomes, not on size of spending.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, we are in this fortunate position because of consistent hard work, prudence, long-term planning and discipline of those who came before us. Such prudence and discipline are not always appreciated. We have had vigorous debates in this House, on whether the Government could afford to spend more freely from reserves, instead of running Budget surpluses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even as recently as January this year, before the Unity Budget was unveiled, many commentators inside and outside of this House speculated on how large our accumulated reserves would be. Yet, it took us just three months into FY2020 to use up the accumulated surplus that we had built up over the current term of Government; since the start of this term of Government. And even that is not enough.&nbsp;</p><p>So, mounting COVID-19 packages amounting to nearly $100 billion, of which more than half is funded from the reserves is not a trivial matter, especially when our yearly budget is about $80 billion. The total of our four Budgets, including the COVID-19 packages, is more than double the size of our annual Budgets in preceding years. Our reserves are a limited resource and we must not take them for granted.</p><p>We owe it to our people – seniors, middle-aged, young and those yet to be born&nbsp;– to be prudent and ensure good governance, so that they too have the resources to navigate future challenges in an uncertain world.</p><p>Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Mohd Irshad asked if we would restore the $52 billion drawn from our Past Reserves, and how long that would take. There is no legal or constitutional obligation for the Government to do so. The Government put back into the Past Reserves the $4 billion it had earlier drawn on in 2009, during the Global Financial Crisis. And not a single cent of the $150 billion of reserves that backed the Government\\'s guarantee of bank deposits was used, when our banking system emerged safely from the Global Financial Crisis.</p><p>This current crisis is of a significantly larger scale and reach than the Global Financial Crisis. We are facing huge uncertainties regarding the course of the pandemic and its economic and social implications. What we do know is that there will likely not be a V-shaped recovery, unlike in past crises. And the amount that we are tapping on is $52 billion. So, how long would it take to build this back? We cannot be definitive.</p><p>At this moment, we must focus our minds fully on making the best use of the resources that we have deployed, be prepared to work hard in the years to come, and have the resolve to rebuild our economy. In this way, the Singapore economy can emerge stronger, and we will be in a strong position to build up our resources. But rest assured that we are committed to rebuild not just our reserves, but also to continue developing Singaporeans and building Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Muhd Faisal Manap and Mr Dennis Tan asked if the President was given information on the amount available in the reserves when the Government sought her in-principle support for drawing on them.&nbsp;</p><p>I am surprised that both Mr Faisal and Mr Dennis Tan had to ask.&nbsp;It is public information that, under our Constitution, the President has access to information about the size of reserves. Under Article 22F of the Constitution, in the exercise of her functions under the Constitution, the President is entitled to any information regarding the reserves. In addition, on the MOF website, it is already mentioned that the President has full information about the size of the reserves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the process of seeking President\\'s approval, the Government has conducted two briefings to President and the Council of Presidential Advisers. These briefings covered the Government\\'s assessment of the global and local health and economic situations, the details of the measures and the resources needed. Ministers Gan Kim Yong, Chan Chun Sing, Lawrence Wong and Indranee Rajah were with me.&nbsp;</p><p>In our system, the President is the custodian of our Past Reserves. She needs to concur with any draw, and her decision is made in full knowledge of why the draw is necessary, and the size of our reserves. In fact, Members have heard the President\\'s message in the Resilience Budget, delivered on her behalf by the Speaker, just before my Ministerial Statement then. We have a strict governance system, scrupulously observed.&nbsp;</p><p>Some have also asked why the Government does not reveal the size of the reserves and let the public decide if we should use more. As Mr Vikram Nair has noted, the size of the reserves invested by MAS and Temasek is public information. But the amount invested by GIC is not disclosed. As I had explained this to Members of this House during my last round-up speech in early April – it is not in our national interest to reveal the full size of our reserves.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides being a buffer against crisis and providing investment return to supplement our annual Budget, our reserves also form our strategic defence against threats. And as a strategic asset, we would be diminishing its value if we disclose this for potential adversaries to use against us.&nbsp;</p><p>No responsible leader will lay bare your nation\\'s defence plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked if we should take advantage of the lower interest rates now, to borrow more to fund expenditure. Fiscal discipline is one of the fundamental principles underpinning Singapore\\'s fiscal system. We spend prudently within our means and responsibly with a value-for-money culture. The rule to run balanced Budgets for each term of Government remains relevant. We also spend equitably, with the principle that each generation bears the cost of the benefits that they enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>That is why we do not borrow to fund our recurrent spending. Doing so means getting our children to fund our current spending. There will be less resources for our children, after repaying such debt. While interest rates may be low now, there is no certainty that we will be able to repay accumulated debt obligations in the future. This is especially so with the uncertain economic outlook, where all countries, including Singapore, will be operating in a tighter fiscal space.</p><p>While we have good reasons not to borrow for our current expenditure, the Government is already using debt productively and equitably to generate long-term returns for Singapore.</p><p>First, the Government issues debt securities domestically. For instance, to develop the domestic debt market. The borrowing proceeds are invested and we are able to cover the debt servicing costs through the investment returns. Second, as announced in Budget 2019, the Government will guarantee the borrowing by Changi Airport Group to fund the development of Changi East, including Terminal 5. In this way, we leverage the strength of the Government\\'s balance sheet to reduce borrowing costs. The debt repayments will be made during a period when the airport will be generating economic returns.</p><p>Lastly, as I had also mentioned in Budget 2019, the Government is considering borrowing for major long-term infrastructure. Long-term infrastructure requires hefty upfront investments and the costs are lumpy. But once built, they benefit many generations of Singaporeans.\\tBorrowing for such developments allows us to spread costs equitably across current and future generations, without the need for sharp increases in taxes.&nbsp;</p><p>We have done so in the past, we borrow for many worthwhile investments that have benefited several generations such as the first terminal at Changi Airport and our first MRT lines. They will continue to generate growth for future generations of Singaporeans.</p><p>I am glad that Members of Parliament have raised concerns about the sustainability of tapping on the reserves. Ms Tin Pei Ling asked whether we are leaving enough reserves behind for future generations. Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Mohd Irshad asked how the draw would influence our policies, moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p>The crisis has underscored the importance of upholding the prudence and discipline of our forefathers to spend responsibly, and prepare for the future. This is why, even as we devote considerable resources to overcome the immediate challenges posed by COVID-19, we must continue to plan ahead to secure a fiscally sustainable future.</p><p>In the medium to long term, our structural needs will persist, and significant fiscal outlay will be required. We need to continue investing in healthcare, education and training, and infrastructure, so that we have adequate capacity to take care of our seniors and support an ageing population; so that we give every child a good start, and give every Singaporean the opportunity to re-skill and up-skill to access good jobs, and so that Singapore remains a liveable city and a place we are proud to call home.</p><p>These heavy and rising expenditures were known even before the outbreak of COVID-19. COVID-19 has increased the urgency for some of these investments, such as developing advanced medical research and production capabilities, and expanding training capacity for our workers.&nbsp;</p><p>It is hence critical that we deploy the right mix of fiscal instruments that meets our principles of prudence and equitable spending. As I mentioned earlier, major long-term infrastructure spending, which requires hefty upfront investments but benefits many generations of Singaporeans, may be financed through borrowing to fairly distribute the cost among those who benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, recurrent spending, should be met with recurrent revenues. Such spending primarily benefits the current generation of Singaporeans, and so, it is fair and responsible for all of us to do our part and chip in.</p><p>In the Unity Budget, I announced that the GST rate increase will not take effect in 2021. However, we will not be able to put off the increase indefinitely, and this will still be needed by 2025. When the GST rate increase does take place, we will cushion the impact for Singaporeans. Six billion dollars in funds have already been set aside during the Unity Budget for the Assurance Package. This is sufficient to offset at least five years\\' worth of additional GST expenses for the majority of households, and more for lower income ones.&nbsp;</p><p>We will continue to absorb GST on publicly-subsidised healthcare and education. Overall, our taxes and transfers system will remain fair and progressive. With this differentiated and principled fiscal strategy, each generation rightly pays for the benefits that they enjoy, and we do not saddle future generations with our bills. This is an equitable approach, and will continue to be the cornerstone of fiscal sustainability for Singapore.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a reason I call this our Fortitude Budget. I announced it in the last week of the circuit breaker. Today, we debate the Budget a few days into Phase One of our reopening.</p><p>The Fortitude Budget supports us as we gradually re-open our society and economy, braces us for the difficult months ahead, and prepares us to emerge stronger. During this time, I have seen and felt Singaporeans\\' fortitude in action. We have been driven and inspired by the fortitude of our people and companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Fortitude itself is not an accidental quality. As Mr Christopher de Souza said, it is about courage in adversity. It is forged in crises past, and hardened in crises present. It comes from the strength of mind and character. In the case of Singapore, our fortitude comes too from the strength of our reserves – the financial reserves that I have just spoken about, and just as important, our deep reserves of social capital.&nbsp;</p><p>Our social capital is made up of the intangible bonds that unite our multi-racial society. The bonds of trust among ourselves and between people and the Government. Our national conversations on the Singapore we want to build. It is the spirit of Singapore Together, where all parts of society work together in partnership, keeping us strong and united, even as the pandemic fragments many societies.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Minister Josephine Teo and Secretary-General Ng Chee Meng shared how our tripartite structure acts to build fortitude in our workforce. I would like to acknowledge and honour the fortitude of our people.&nbsp;</span></p><p>This crisis has brought out the best in our community. Many Singaporeans have come together to donate their Solidarity Payments to charitable causes.&nbsp;Over 10,000 people have stepped forward over the past two months to volunteer. They run errands for seniors living alone, distribute care packs, manage the National Care Hotline and deliver food supplies to migrant workers and vulnerable families, among others.</p><p>For example, during his in-camp training, Mr Rajasegaran Ramachandran stepped up to serve at the frontline as a medic at the Singapore Expo care facility to care for COVID-19 patients as he wanted to do his part for the nation.</p><p>Corporates, volunteer centres and community groups have also come together to contribute.&nbsp;And there are many encouraging stories of people helping one another, such as seniors providing mutual support. Mdm Julie Li, at age 82, frequently checked in with fellow seniors on the phone and shared healthy cooking recipes with them during the circuit breaker.</p><p>Individuals, too, have shown resilience and adapted to seize new opportunities. Ms Catherine Tang, who has mild autism and works at The Art Faculty store at the Enabling Village, attended online courses during the circuit breaker to improve her customer service skills and support the store\\'s e-commerce platform. I met her over a year ago. It is good to see her keeping so cheerful.</p><p>Many public servants across different agencies have been working hard during COVID-19 to help Singaporeans. They coordinate our pandemic response, respond to Singaporeans\\' queries, implement support measures and keep up regular Government services. Many more have stepped up to take on frontline roles such as safe distancing ambassadors to help keep our communities safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me express on behalf of this House our appreciation to our many volunteers and donors to our frontline officers and to all our people in Singapore who have taken the precautionary measures seriously and done your part. Every constructive action adds to our social reserves that allow us to face this challenge with fortitude. I encourage more Singaporeans to step forward and help one another in our community.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, contrary to what Mr Singh has mentioned earlier that we are only consulting people inside the business community, the Government has taken extra effort to take a far broader approach. I think yesterday, Miss Cheryl Chan spoke about Our Singapore Conversation and Singapore Together. Just last week, Ministers Desmond Lee, Grace Fu, Indranee Rajah and I had a very good discussion with leaders in our social service agencies. We all felt very cheered by the dedication of our people in the frontline. They were doing their utmost to support our vulnerable people. It is a great example of democracy of deed&nbsp;– of taking action to make a difference. And Ms Yip Pin Xiu mentioned about the sports community and how they are supporting one another.</p><p>In growing our social reserves, we must continue to support and care for those who have less and those who have fallen on hard times. We will walk this journey with you and leave no one behind.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last two days, Members of Parliament like Mr Ang Hin Kee, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Louis Ng proposed refinements and additional measures for various groups in our society. I appreciate your feedback and suggestions. In coming out with each of the Budgets, my colleagues and I had reached out through many channels – social service agencies, community partners, unionists and grassroots leaders – to identify where the greatest needs are.&nbsp;We then carefully considered how we can help those who are most in need, especially those among us who are less able to articulate their needs. The result is not perfect but has gone a long way in alleviating pain points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Zainal Sapari, Ms Foo Mee Har and Ms Anthea Ong asked if we can enhance existing COVID-19 support schemes for low-income workers and households, especially if unemployment persists.&nbsp;</p><p>While some COVID-19 schemes such as the Solidarity Payment and Solidarity Utilities Credit cover all Singaporeans, the overall payouts are tilted towards lower- to middle-income groups as they have less to fall back on in difficult times.&nbsp;</p><p>During this COVID-19 period, 60% of households can receive additional benefits equivalent to 12% of household income on average. These benefits include cash assistance from the Temporary Relief Fund, COVID-19 Support Grant and Workfare Special Payment, among others. This is a significant sum&nbsp;– double that given out during the Global Financial Crisis.</p><p>There may be instances of families who marginally miss the eligibility criteria but also need help. We will assess these on a case-by-case basis, and refine our schemes as the situation develops.</p><p>Other Members like Miss Cheng Li Hui, Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Ms Sylvia Lim raised concerns on how some Singaporeans may feel marginalised by the rapid adoption of digital technology.</p><p>Minister Iswaran laid out our road map for a digital future, with digital inclusion at the heart of our plans. New initiatives like the SG Digital Office, Hawkers Go Digital and Seniors Go Digital will complement existing programmes such as NEU PC Plus and Home Access.&nbsp;</p><p>We take your concerns like the need to equip our seniors with cybersecurity awareness seriously. But we should not let fear paralyse us into sticking with the status quo.&nbsp;As the world changes, we want to move fast on digital transformation but more importantly, we are determined to move together in digital inclusion.</p><p>Ms Denise Phua, Ms Yip Pin Xiu and Mr Melvin Yong also called for more support for vulnerable groups, including those with special needs and mental health conditions.&nbsp;I thank Ms Denise Phua for reminding us of my statement that social service agencies are a key partner in our support for our people. Ms Denise Phua has made a&nbsp;thoughtful suggestion&nbsp;– or several suggestions, including one to formalise a workstream on employment for people with disabilities within the National Jobs Council. I have just spoken to Senior Minister Tharman and, in fact, both of us welcome her leadership on this and are glad to support her proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>Together with our community partners, we have put in resources – finances, networks and systems – over the years to support the vulnerable and I assure members that we will continue to do so.</p><p>For example, we have built up physical networks to strengthen social service delivery through the SG Cares Community Network. Such physical links are complemented with digital ones to build up bonds among people and within the community. WE CARE Community Services set up a cloud-based contact centre and tele-counselling facilities so that staff can take calls from their homes to continue serving persons with addiction issues. This approach increased participation rates among its beneficiaries.</p><p>Together, the COVID-19 support measures should be seen in the context of the larger suite of measures to protect jobs and livelihoods and support our businesses during this crisis.</p><p>Some people have said that the support for jobs is big while the support to me or my household seems small. A thoughtful commentator said to me, it is right that the Government has devoted, as a central plank of the four Budgets, this central focus on supporting our workers to retain their jobs or to move into new jobs, because should the sole breadwinner of the family lose his or her job, the effect on the whole family is much more adverse. So, it is important that we see this in totality, not just what is in each little compartment.</p><p>Moreover, bear in mind that our social spending has nearly doubled over the last ten years and this reflects our commitment to invest in and support our people. Ms Joan Pereira, Mr Terence Ho and Ms Yip Pin Xiu spoke on areas that merit additional support. I would like to assure them that even as we battle the pandemic, we will continue our longer-term investments in education, housing and healthcare and continue to uplift our arts and sports sectors.&nbsp;We will take lessons from COVID-19 to continue refining our social support policies to help build stronger families and communities.&nbsp;</p><p>Individuals and the community too play a role.&nbsp;Miss Cheryl Chan said, \"the Government can act as a catalyst but we ourselves must be the change makers.\" There is a role for every Singaporean to play. We have the reserves of strength and kindness in each of us to pay it forward in deed or resources to help support someone else.</p><p>Moments of crisis are a test of the strength of our reserves and we have the strength – not least of all in ourselves as a people.&nbsp;We have the fortitude to each do our part and emerge stronger.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say a few words in Mandarin before I conclude in English.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-Heng Swee Keat Fortitude Roundup 5June2020-Chinese_MOF edits.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Today is the fourth day of the post-circuit breaker period. We have entered the first phase of resuming work and school. As we are unable to predict how the COVID-19 situation will evolve, we will need to remain vigilant and observe safe distancing measures. If everyone is socially responsible, it is possible that by the end of June, we will be able to enter the second phase of reopening.</p><p>In the past few months, the global economy has been badly hit in terms of demand and supply. As a small and open economy, Singapore has also been severely affected.</p><p>&nbsp;In four months, we have introduced four Budgets totaling around $100 billion to deal with the COVID-19 situation to protect our health, save jobs, save livelihoods, save businesses and secure our future.&nbsp;</p><p>The Budget not only protects us during the storm and acts as a buffer during the current crisis, it is also a booster that will drive the economy when the storm passes and will help Singaporeans and businesses prepare for the future.</p><p>The tripartite partners will continue to work closely. This is one of the key factors that will help us overcome the crisis. However, we should not believe that every job will be saved or all companies will be able to continue operating. Those who are badly hit by COVID-19 and those who need to make structural changes will have to overhaul their business strategies. Only by saving viable businesses can we protect every worker and their livelihoods. Hence, the Government will spare no efforts to create jobs and training opportunities for Singaporeans. The newly established National Jobs Council is also committed to help jobless Singaporeans return to the workplace. At the same time, through various measures complemented by various industry transformation road maps, we will speed up the pace of economic transformation. The Government will also help companies reduce cost and retain their workers.</p><p>We will also provide cash grants to Singaporeans, especially to help middle to lower income families manage living expenses, to take care of Singaporeans in need as far as possible.</p><p>In other countries, governments have issued debt to finance their relief measures. Singapore is different, because Singaporeans from previous generations and previous governments have been managing our finances prudently. We are able to accumulate national reserves through the years. Thus, we have been able to respond decisively to the crisis without taking on debt. We will use every dollar wisely so that the economy can recover swiftly.</p><p>In the future, we are determined to rebuild our economy and work hard for our next generation. We will also need to continue to manage our finances prudently, increase our income through sustainable avenues to meet the needs of recurrent expenditures.</p><p>The post-COVID world will be totally different. We must be prepared for the new normal.&nbsp;</p><p>The COVID-19 situation has worsened the impact of economic cycles, sped up structural changes in the global economy and deepened the fault-lines between countries. Digitalisation of the economy will be deeper, broader and faster. Market structures, trade flows, people and capital flows will also be affected. Singapore will continue to strengthen trade and economic links with other countries to stabilise our supply chains and trade networks. Companies must move with the times in order to seize opportunities. Workers must also upskill and be willing to take on new jobs.</p><p>The COVID-19 situation has also highlighted the challenges faced by people in need. However, it is encouraging that Singaporeans have shown their best during this period, for example, cohesion, empathy, and helping those around us who are in need. I hope Singaporeans will continue to show care for others.&nbsp;</p><p>I also hope that through the Singapore Together movement, we will be able to create a more inclusive and caring society.</p><p>This is undoubtedly the most serious challenge faced by our generation.</p><p>The First World War resulted in a \"lost\" generation. Internationally, there are also discussions on whether lockdowns due to COVID-19 will lead to a \"lockdown\" generation. I strongly believe that Singapore has the capability to overcome the crisis. As long as we work together, stay united and resilient, forge ahead with fortitude, there will be no \"lockdown\" generation. Instead, we will emerge stronger and become a generation that is more united, stronger and more resilient.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now conclude in English. At the start of the speech, I spoke of the great uncertainty ahead and the fundamental shifts that are taking place at an accelerated pace. What does this changed world demand of us? There is no easy answer. We need to adapt and transform ourselves – with agility, creativity and determination. To survive and emerge stronger from the huge uncertainties ahead, we must get three things right.</p><p>First, we must have good governance and strong, adaptive leadership – a Government that works with you and for you; that is always honest with our people about the truth; steadfast in preparing and anticipating what lies ahead; and committed to supporting our people and businesses to meet uncertainty head-on and emerge stronger.</p><p>We must have strong social reserves, not just in each of us as individuals or just in our different communities, but across all levels and parts of our society, working together and holding one another up with trust and in solidarity. And we must be crystal clear and unwavering about our values and mission – what we stand for and what we are here to achieve. These make up the essence of the Singapore Together movement, which I launched last year to take Singapore forward. More than ever before, these fundamentals will be crucial as we navigate the uncertainties ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>Our circumstances have changed over the years, but the Government\\'s aspirations for Singapore have not. It is to be a place where our people, regardless of race, language or religion, can build a better life. We seek to be a vibrant and innovative economy, so as to create good jobs and opportunities for our people; a smart, green, healthy and liveable city that we can be proud to call home; a fair, just and harmonious society where our people care for and support one another; and a safe and secure nation, and a responsible member of the global community.</p><p>This is not the first crisis that Singapore has faced nor will it be the last. Past generations of Singaporeans have weathered numerous challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pioneer Generation survived the hardships of World War II. The Merdeka Generation grew up in a tumultuous period leading up to Singapore\\'s Independence. In recent times, Singaporeans experienced the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, the dot-com bust in 2001, SARS in 2003 and the Global Financial Crisis in 2008.</p><p>What about our generation? How will we respond to this crisis&nbsp;of our generation? Each generation\\'s crisis and response are different. The one constant is how we have persevered with fortitude and emerged stronger. This time, there will be huge uncertainties ahead. But we will continue to persevere and we will, once again, emerge stronger.</p><p>We are fighting this battle from a position of strength. We have a strong fiscal position. Our founding generation left us a legacy of a sizeable Reserve, which we must continue to treasure and build on. We have strong social reserves, supported by mutual trust, close partnerships, strong values and a sense of mutual responsibility and support.</p><p>But more importantly, we are fighting this battle from a position of Unity, Resilience, Solidarity and Fortitude.&nbsp;We stand together as one united country and one people.&nbsp;</p><p>We are uniquely fortunate to have built up a priceless harmony, sense of common identity and shared destiny, even as we draw on our diversity of strengths and experiences.</p><p>We are a resilient people. We will never allow a crisis to bring us down. Even in these trying times, we continue to look ahead. Our people are hardworking and disciplined, willing to learn new skills and adapt. We have enterprising businesses that are ready to grasp new opportunities and thrive in the face of competition.</p><p>We stand in solidarity with, and care for and support, one another, especially the more vulnerable members of our society. Our people, businesses, the Labour Movement and the Government stand together in partnership, not in division. We stand in solidarity with countries around the world in this pandemic, building on our assets of trust, reliability and efficiency.</p><p>We have the grit to persevere in adversity with fortitude. We will forge new paths and never waver in our efforts to build a stronger Singapore together. We have a strong healthcare system. We have highly dedicated frontline workers who have worked day and night over the last few months to keep us safe. We will overcome this crisis with fortitude and solidarity.&nbsp;We will emerge stronger as an economy, as a society, and as one united, resilient and determined people.

I just want to reconfirm that what I have heard from the Deputy Prime Minister is correct with regard to the question that I have asked – whether the Government has provided the President with the information on the amount that we have in the Reserves. So, am I right to say&nbsp;– and I just want to confirm with the Deputy Prime Minister – that the answer given by him is, yes, the Government did provide this information?</p><p><strong>Mr Heng Swee Keat</strong>: I am surprised that Mr Faisal Manap did not hear this statement of mine so clearly. The answer is yes. The Member can go back to the transcript of the Hansard and the recording of this session. But, by the way, I should add that, as I have said – and I hope the Member has heard it&nbsp;– the&nbsp;information is public. It is in our Constitution and it is on the website of MOF.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Anthea Ong.</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Could I ask Deputy Prime Minister Heng if he could address the question in my speech about asking if he would consider waiving six months\\' rent for all households residing in rental flats except for those whose rental is already covered under the ComCare scheme?</p><p><strong>Mr Heng Swee Keat</strong>: I thank Ms Anthea Ong for her question. As I have said at the outset, all Members of this House have spoken extensively on this Budget and if I were to cover every single point, we would go beyond these two hours. But rest assured that whatever good suggestions will be taken up by the various Ministries so that we can respond to each of these.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Any other clarifications?

(proc text)]</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><h6>5.43 pm</h6><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Second Supplementary Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, contained in Paper Cmd 28 of 2020.</p><p>I shall deal first with the Heads of Expenditure in respect of which amendments stand on the Order Paper Supplement. Head M, Ministry of Finance.</p><h6><em>Head M – Ministry of Finance</em></h6><p>&nbsp;<strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Anthea Ong.</p><h6><em>Transnational Families and Migrant Spouses</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".</p><p>Low-income transnational families have been particularly hard-hit by COVID-19 and circuit breaker measures. According to an AWARE survey with migrant spouses of Singaporean citizens in May, 99% of 36 respondents have either lost their jobs or seen a drastic decrease in income since the onset of COVID-19. Close to half were not earning any income from work because their jobs did not allow them to work from home.&nbsp;</p><p>Migrant spouses are particularly vulnerable in times of economic crisis as they are often the first to be let go, especially since COVID-19 related job support schemes do not provide incentives for employers to retain non-citizen workers. Can the Ministry consider funding an online platform to facilitate job-matching for these workers&nbsp;at a national level so that employers looking to hire overseas workers could be encouraged to hire from this pool, which includes migrant spouses, first?&nbsp;</p><p>This widespread loss in income is making it difficult for many migrant spouses and their families to meet basic needs. They can receive a $300 one-off Solidarity payment but only if they are on LTVP+. Even so, this amount may be insufficient. According to AWARE\\'s survey, more than half of the respondents reported that, in addition to their current household income, which mostly falls below $2,000, they still need more than $300 a month to meet their basic needs. To cope, some have cut down on food-related expenses; a few said they were unable to pay rent.&nbsp;</p><h6>5.45 pm</h6><p>Can the Government consider relaxing the citizenship criteria for COVID-19 related financial assistance and make them available for all migrant spouses with a<strong> </strong>Singaporean in their household? Only when we include those who have chosen to make Singapore home and help raise our children can we truly say we are “SG United”.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Minister Indranee.</p><p><strong>The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah)</strong>: Mr Chairman, if I may now address Ms Ong’s questions on support for transnational families and migrant spouses.&nbsp;</p><p>The support schemes announced at the various Budgets aim to provide support to Singaporean households, including those with non-citizen members, who may be concerned over household expenses during this period. These include household-based benefits like GST Voucher – U-Save rebates and Service and Conservancy Charges Rebate under the Care and Support Package, and the Solidarity Utilities Credit. Transnational families would already be receiving support through the $600 Solidarity Payment to the citizen member, and $300 Solidarity Payment to the PR or LTVP+ spouse. This was explained by the Deputy Prime Minister during the round-up of the Solidarity Budget and in response to a Parliamentary Question from Mr Murali Pillai last month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If they or their Singaporean family need further financial support during this challenging period, they may seek help through the MSF Social Service Offices (SSOs), which provide assistance to those who fall into financial hardship. MSF has exercised more flexibility when considering ComCare applications during this period, to ensure affected Singaporean families, including those with non-citizen members, can get help. SSOs will also work closely with other agencies and partners to address the family’s needs, including employment concerns.&nbsp;There are also many Social Service Agencies and those in the community providing support to families in need. These include Social Service Agencies funded by MSF to support transnational families.&nbsp;</p><p>Migrant spouses who are allowed to work can access work opportunities through many channels, including job advertisements, referrals, recruitment agencies and various online platforms.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Would Ms Anthea Ong like to withdraw the amendment?</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Mr Chairman, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p><p>[(proc text) Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Ms Anthea Ong.</p><h6><em>Emerging Stronger Mentally</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head O of the Estimates be reduced by $100.”</span></p><p>As Singapore extends safe distancing measures to protect lives, we must remain aware of how doing so leads to not only “costs” for our economy and businesses, but real and significant detriments to our mental health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed “widespread psychological distress” in COVID-19 affected populations, with mental distress being reported in 35% of the population surveyed in China and 45% in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>A similar picture of a “mental health pandemic” is being observed in Singapore. In an Ipsos survey of 1,000 Singaporeans between late April and early May, one in four respondents said they were not in good mental health. Our national suicide prevention hotline, operated by the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), received 23% more calls in April from March. Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL) has shared with me that their caseloads have significantly increased in the last three months, with many care-givers reporting increases in mental health relapses and crisis incidents experienced by their care recipients, four of them have even lost their loved ones to suicide just in the last six weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To deal with the psychological fallout from COVID-19, countries like New Zealand and Scotland have relied heavily on mental health experts in their COVID-19 response. The extended safe distancing measures for Phase One of exiting the circuit breaker is likely to prolong mental distress, as we continue to deal with social isolation, the lack of personal space, and disruption to routines. Would the Ministry consider appointing mental health experts for the Multi-Ministry COVID-19 Task Force, to advise on mental health implications as we extend the stringent safe distancing measures to re-open cautiously?&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore’s economic woes are likely to continue for the long term, as GDP growth forecasts have been downgraded from -4% to -7%.&nbsp;As the resident unemployment rate climbed to a 10-year high of 3.3% in March, a survey by Profile Asia indicated that many employees are facing increased levels of stress dealing with uncertainty over future pay cuts and their jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng talked about seeking out “opportunities in adversity” during his Fortitude Budget Statement. The COVID-19 crisis also offers us an unprecedented opportunity in equipping businesses and workers for the rebound through improving workplace wellness. A recent report has linked business recovery from COVID-19 to a sustained focus on employee well-being. Would the Ministry consider appointing at least one mental health expert on the Emerging Stronger Task Force to advise on well-being policy interventions to strengthen our recovery from this crisis?</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor.</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)</strong>:&nbsp;The mental health of our nation is important, and the Government is committed to taking care of the mental well-being of Singaporeans, especially during this COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic has resulted in increased stressors that impact our mental well-being, given the changes in daily routines, social isolation and economic uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, more support needs to be put in place to address the mental stress that the COVID-19 pandemic and circuit breaker measures have brought about. The Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) recognises this and has been tapping on mental health professionals from MSF, MOH and MOE to give inputs on the psychological aspects of COVID, and in the enhancement and development of mental health initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Our public healthcare institutions (PHIs) continued to provide essential mental health services during the circuit breaker period. Some of our community mental health partners continued to conduct urgent home visits for vulnerable clients and those at risk of self-harm, harm to others, or at-risk of deterioration. Tele-consultations were also adopted by PHIs and community service providers so that they remain connected with their clients to ensure their mental health needs are supported.&nbsp;</p><p>A specific initiative developed is the new 24-hour National CARE Hotline (NCH). The NCH, which came into operation in April 2020, is manned by volunteers comprising trained psychologists, counsellors, social workers and other professionals, and provides support to the larger community on mental health concerns, such as anxiety and adjustment issues related to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>For employees, MOM, along with other agencies, such as MSF, AIC and NCSS, issued an Inter-Agency Advisory with practical steps to support employees’ mental well-being and provided counselling resources for employers and workers to tap on.&nbsp;</p><p>For students, school counsellors continue to support those in need through face-to-face and online sessions. Vulnerable students were actively identified for further support and invited to return to school during the CB period. MOE also provided students with Holiday Care Packs containing resources and helplines on mental well-being and cyber wellness.&nbsp;</p><p>For the elderly, the Silver Generation Office reached out to some 47,000 vulnerable seniors to refer them to assistance as required, including befriending and mental health services. As we gradually ease movement restrictions, we have also paid special attention to addressing the well-being of seniors. The decision to allow children to visit their parents or grandparents is one example.&nbsp;</p><p>The Emerging Stronger Task Force (EST) was set up primarily to develop recommendations on how Singapore should refresh, reimagine or reset its economic strategies, to stay economically resilient and build new sources of dynamism in the post-COVID-19 world.&nbsp;Hence, besides the two co-chairs, the remaining members are industry representatives.&nbsp;Nonetheless, the EST has committed to consult multiple stakeholders to draw on insights beyond its membership.&nbsp;</p><p>MOH, together with the relevant partners and agencies, will continue to ensure that mental health support and services are accessible to persons in need. We will take into consideration the impact of COVID-19 on mental health as we undertake a whole-of-Government review of our mental health strategy and study ways to further strengthen our community mental health services to support new vulnerable groups that may emerge due to COVID-19.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Any clarifications?</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response. Could I then ask if MOH has the intention to increase funding for these community health organisations? Many of them have actually shared with me that, well, we know that there is a long tail to the mental health impact and they are also sharing that increased funding would really help them in terms of increasing their capacity.</p><p><strong>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>: In this Fortitude Budget, MOH has an increased budget to implement many of the COVID-19 management measures. I have no doubt that even as we undertake a whole-of-Government review of our mental health strategies to strengthen mental health services, where there is a need to access additional funding, that could be put into the next Budget, if necessary.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Would Ms Ong like to withdraw the amendment, please?</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Chairman,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p><p>[(proc text) Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Ms Anthea Ong.</p><h6><em>Identifying \"Promising\" Start-ups</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;</span>I would like to declare my interest as an impact investor and also founder of social enterprise Hush TeaBar and A Good Space Co-operative. Both are start-ups.&nbsp;</p><p>The Deputy Prime Minister announced that $285 million will be set aside to support “promising start-ups”. I appreciate that this is a longer term view to maintain our attractiveness and robustness as one of the top start-up eco-systems in the world. However, start-ups are inherently risky and identification of \"promising start-ups\" is often a hit-and-miss endeavour. I know this as an investor and an entrepreneur. Economic downturns often sift the wheat from the chaff, leaving the most resilient ones behind. By intervening in the sifting process, is there a danger of&nbsp;the Government artificially propping up ailing start-ups and distorting market forces? Moreover, an inability to adapt to the changing economic landscape by continuing to rely on Government financing seems to go against the spirit of start-ups.</p><h6>6.00 pm</h6><p>What was the reason behind dedicating $285 million to support \"promising start-ups\", which can also tap into the many support schemes for SMEs, over other areas of spending, such as extending greater support to struggling households like public rental waivers? Which immediate concerns or areas of national priority will the $285 million be used to address, for example, climate change? What are the checks and balances in place to ensure that the $285 million will be effectively utilised?</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Dr Koh Poh Koon.</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, start-ups play an important role in our economy. They contribute to the development of new technologies and the rejuvenation of traditional industries. We have set aside $285 million in the Fortitude Budget to provide financing support for promising start-ups. Ms Anthea Ong asked why our start-ups need more help and how we intend to identify the promising ones. In fact, the answer is in her question. The keyword here is \"promising\".</p><p>Start-ups, especially those that work on cutting-edge technologies, need to be nurtured with long-term patient capital.&nbsp;COVID-19, unfortunately, has sharply curtailed the availability of such capital.&nbsp;The Special Situation Fund for Startups is intended to fill this gap.&nbsp;Other countries like the UK and France have introduced similar measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Without help from the Government, many high potential start-ups will likely scale back their innovation activities or even cease prematurely. That will be a loss to Singapore and will certainly have a detrimental impact on Singapore\\'s innovation eco-system, which we have painstakingly built up over the years. By helping promising start-ups sustain their growth momentum, we want to maintain the vibrancy of our eco-system and maximise the value of our innovation-related investments.&nbsp;</p><p>To impose market discipline, the scheme will operate on a co-investment basis with private sector investors that have expertise in assessing the value and viability of start-ups. This will also help crowd in more private capital. These co-investors can also offer industry insights, networks and even mentorships to help our start-ups to succeed better.</p><p>Mr Chairman, the COVID-19 pandemic presents many immediate challenges. But even as we address the immediate ones, we must not forget to put in place plans for our future, so that Singapore, our companies and Singaporeans can emerge stronger post COVID-19.&nbsp;Start-ups are a critical part of these plans.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Any clarifications?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Thank you, Mr Chairman.&nbsp;I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response. I am very happy to hear that we will be co-investing in these start-ups. Could I ask the Senior Minister of State if there is a plan in this co-investing to take equity or is that in the form of grants? And if, once the start-ups are on their way to growth, would we then ask for a clawback of the initial investment or grant?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: You have eight seconds.</p><p><strong>Dr Koh Poh Koon</strong>: Mr Chairman, I thank the Member for the question. Under this scheme, the Government will co-invest in the selected start-ups, together with the private sector, on a one-to-one basis via convertible bonds. A convertible bond is of one of the most expedient instruments to invest into a company in this current COVID-19 situation as discussions on equity valuation can be deferred to the next funding round, hopefully, when the economic situation is better.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Would Ms Ong like to withdraw the amendment?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Mr Chairman, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p><p>[(proc text) Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Assoc Prof Walter Theseira.</p><h6><em>Worker Classification and Income Support</em></h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head S of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\"</p><p>Sir, many Singaporean workers who have lost income due to COVID-19 have benefited from the Government\\'s income support schemes. These help schemes are differentiated between employees, who are eligible for the COVID-19 Support Grant, and the self-employed, who are eligible for the Self-employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS).</p><p>I believe the Government has sought to address the different needs of each group in designing these schemes. However, the maximum cash assistance quantum at $9,000 is higher for the SIRS than for the Support Grant at $2,400. Inclusion in SIRS is also automatic for qualifying Singaporeans, whereas the Support Grant must be applied for.</p><p>This difference in benefits has caused some concern among workers who believe that their employment classification – as an employee or as a self-employed person – does not accurately reflect how they work, their control over their income, and their COVID-19 income risks. There are also workers who are not sure which group they belong to.</p><p>I will give two examples. Our Universities engage adjunct instructors to teach. They are paid on a piece rate per course. This was previously considered self-employment. The Universities were informed this treatment was incorrect. Therefore, the Universities switched to using contracts of service, which made them employees. But the adjuncts are actually still paid on a per-course basis. Nothing has changed about their work. They still lack the income security of full-time or even part-time employees, although they now do get CPF contributions.</p><p>Another example is that of workers who are unsure of their status. I was told that a hair stylist needed to apply for a COVID-19 income support grant. Is the hair stylist an employee or self-employed? It turns out that this person operates under a reverse commission model. The stylist works in a hair salon, she pays the salon owner a percentage of the revenue she brings in. This sounds like self-employment. But then, the salon owner may believe that the stylist works for them and may impose conditions on how and when they work. These cases often have no formal contract or they have a contract which is poorly drafted. An appeal was made demonstrating self-employment and I believe the stylist got their SIRS payment. But the point is that these work arrangements are not always easy to classify sometimes.</p><p>Sir, a worker who faces income risks due to COVID-19 needs help, regardless of how they are classified. Can we do more to ensure that help is calibrated to the workers\\' actual income risks and income level, rather than their classification status? For example, if a part-time or contract employee faces substantial income risks, because they are hired on a case-by-case basis, could they be considered for SIRS benefits instead? We should also review the legal status of different work arrangements. Other countries are exploring an intermediate classification between employment and self-employment for gig-economy workers and those whose work is under the partial control of another. So, really, to cope with the severe shocks induced by COVID-19, we should aim for benefits tailored to income risks, rather than tailored to the classification of the worker.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Anthea Ong, you can take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Workplace Adjustments for Mental Health</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Yes, Mr Chairman. Businesses have been hard-hit by COVID-19. Not referenced in the Fortitude Budget is the impact of the pandemic on the mental well-being of employees. I have mentioned earlier that in a survey of business leaders and HR professionals, nearly one in two Singaporeans has had their mental health adversely affected by COVID-19.</p><p>A recent survey also found that employees without managers attuned to their well-being are 61% more likely to say they have been less productive. Hence, establishing workplace adjustments for mental health must be an urgent priority for business and overall economic recovery. The inter-agency advisory for employers to support employee well-being, which Senior Minister of State Amy Khor alluded to earlier, is a step in the right direction.&nbsp;</p><p>Protecting jobs is as important as protecting employability, which includes mental well-being. Can the Ministry integrate the inter-agency advisory into the Job Support Scheme (JSS) such that beneficiary employers must demonstrate effort to introduce workplace adjustments to support their employees? I propose that businesses should adopt Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs), mental health insurance coverage for employees and/or other well-being programmes to qualify for JSS payouts in July and October.</p><p>Also, will the Ministry consider encouraging these progressive well-being practices with further incentives? I propose that the Ministry expands the scope of the Enhanced Work-Life Grant beyond flexible working arrangements (FWAs), for funding EAPs and/or other well-being programmes.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Jobs Support Scheme </em>– <em>Mitigating Failure of Trickle-down Economics</em></h6><p>Next cut. The Government has signalled that the COVID-19 Support Grant is an important—sorry, that is the wrong one.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: It is okay, the clock is ticking.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Yes, I know. Sorry. I missed that.&nbsp;</p><p>The intention behind the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to protect jobs and salary is welcome. However, abuse has been ongoing. MOM has received complaints about companies taking JSS monies and not using them to support their employees. It appears that workers have been threatened with dismissal if they complain about their employer\\'s errant behaviour.&nbsp;IRAS announced on 3 June 2020 that employers who abuse the JSS may be charged under the Penal Code and face imprisonment and a fine. I applaud this strong stand against abuse of the scheme. However, I also note that IRAS continues to encourage individuals to report malpractices and abuses of JSS. Despite IRAS\\' promise that whistle-blowers\\' identities will be kept strictly confidential, I foresee many cases in which this will pose little obstacles to the employer discovering the identity of the whistle-blower. Some complaints may never make it to the authorities because the employees do not know of the avenues for complaint or are afraid of souring their relationships with their employers. This is particularly true for elderly or lower income employees who will be most affected by the loss of their jobs and are consequently more vulnerable to exploitation.</p><p>To empower employees to make complaints against errant employers and protect the most vulnerable in our workforce, will the Government consider a strong whistle-blowing protection law similar to the protected disclosures regime in the UK\\'s employment Rights Act 1996 that is adequately communicated to all workers so that they are aware of the channels and feel safe exercising their right to whistle-blow. Further, instead of relying on goodwill, should there be a mechanism to make companies that are unaffected by or even profiting from the crisis return their JSS payouts?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Low Yen Ling.</p><p><strong>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling)</strong>: Mr Chairman, as we go through these challenging times, the Government is committed to protecting livelihoods and sustaining businesses. The support provided through the Unity, Resilience, Solidarity and Fortitude Budgets is targeted to help keep businesses viable and workers employed, so that they can tide over this crisis and recover quickly as the economy restarts.&nbsp;</p><p>MOM, with the support of the four Budgets, seeks to achieve this in three ways, namely: one,&nbsp;ensuring fair support for all workers – both for the employees and self-employed persons (SEPs); two,&nbsp;championing fair employment practices; and three,&nbsp;promoting mental well-being in our workplaces.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, ensuring fair support for all workers. The Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) has cushioned the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the labour market by helping employers to hold on to their employees and continue paying their salaries, even during the Circuit Breaker period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We introduced the SEP Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) to help Singaporean SEPs with less means and family support tide over this difficult period. Although SIRS is means-tested, the Government has taken into consideration that these are unprecedented times.&nbsp;For comparison, usually, about 50,000 SEPs receive Workfare each year. In other words, they are assessed to need more help.&nbsp;SIRS has now benefited over 120,000 SEPs – more than double the usual number of Workfare recipients.</p><h6>6.15 pm</h6><p>We understand that many SEPs may have seen their incomes fall. Nonetheless, the income criterion serves as a proxy for their ability to save and, therefore, the likelihood of their ability to tide through periods of less earnings.&nbsp;</p><p>It should also be noted that about 80% of the personal income taxpayers earn incomes below the SIRS criterion of $100,000 a year or about $9,000 a month. In other words, one would have to be in the top 20% taxpayers\\' bracket to exceed the SIRS criterion.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the Annual Value (AV) of property criterion, it serves as a proxy for wealth and family support. The Government has similarly sought to cover more people under SIRS. The AV criterion of $21,000 covers about nine in 10 owner-occupied residential public and private properties.</p><p>We understand that some of the SEPs who exceed the AV criterion may not themselves own these higher-end properties. Rest assured they can still appeal to be considered for SIRS. We will work with NTUC to assess the circumstances on a case-by-case basis and ensure that the scheme helps SEPs who most need it. Even if an appellant is not eligible for SIRS, we will certainly connect him or her with other relevant agencies like the Social Service Offices (SSOs) to offer other forms of assistance.</p><p>Mr Chairman, in administering schemes and programmes, such as SIRS, the Government has always partnered various like-minded organisations to better serve Singaporeans and our businesses. This is a key feature of tripartism and has served our Singaporean workers very well.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, we work with the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), NTUC\\'s Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) and Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) to administer the Work-Life Grant (WLG). Likewise, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) is our appointed programme manager for SGUnited Traineeships, working with host companies to review and approve the scope and development plans of the proposed traineeships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Other Government agencies, such as Enterprise Singapore (ESG), have also partnered with Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) to administer schemes for companies. In governing these schemes, the responsible Ministries and agencies determine the policy parameters, including the eligibility criteria. The Ministries set clear boundaries within which our partners must operate, and any exceptions would require the Ministry’s approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Chairman, over the past few years, several Members of Parliament and members of the public have raised concern that some employees could be misclassified as SEPs and, as a result, not received CPF contributions from their employers and other employee benefits, such as leave entitlement. Assoc Prof Walter Theseira also raised this question earlier in his cut.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In determining whether an individual is an employee or SEP, the Singapore Courts consider factors, such as the degree of control exerted by the company and its ability to decide on the hours of work. However, given the wide variety of work arrangements today, each case must be evaluated based on the specific circumstances. The Government applies a similar approach to the Courts when assessing the employment status of an individual.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure that the employees are not misclassified as SEPs and denied their statutory employment benefits, MOM follows up on complaints – every one of them that we received – and ensures that the employers make rectifications where needed. For example, arising from feedback from adjunct teaching associates a few years ago, MOM worked with our Autonomous Universities to ensure that the CPF contributions and leave entitlements were provided to those working as employees.</p><p>I understand that during the circuit breaker period, adjunct teaching associates have continued to receive full salaries from their Universities which are supported by the JSS payouts.</p><p>Secondly, championing Fair Employment practices.&nbsp;The Government has provided substantial support through the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to help our employers retain and pay local workers. Deputy Prime Minister Heng recapped and shared with us that the JSS amounted to $23.5 billion, protecting 1.9 million jobs for Singaporeans. Employers should act responsibly and fairly, and make sure that they are ensuring that their local workers are given wages even if they are unable to work.</p><p>I want to assure Ms Anthea Ong that the Government takes a very serious view of irresponsible, unfair or fraudulent employment practices, including false reporting of workers\\' CPF payments by employers to obtain higher JSS payouts. We take a whole-of-Government approach to identify such fraudulent cases. As highlighted in the media release by IRAS on Wednesday this week, there are severe penalties for any attempt to abuse the JSS.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to assure Ms Ong that workers need not be afraid to come forward to report any infringement of employment laws, because the Employment Act protects them from wrongful dismissal by employers, especially those who seek to punish workers for exercising their rights.&nbsp;</p><p>Employers who wrongfully dismiss their workers may be ordered to pay compensation or to reinstate workers to their former jobs. Errant employers may also see a withdrawal of Government-paid employment support or suspension of their Work Pass privileges. MOM takes all feedback on employment law infringements very seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>During this difficult period, workers and employers have to work even more closely together than ever before and strive to maintain open channels of communication. As Mr Louis Ng pointed out, employees may need greater work flexibility to deal with the disruptions that arise due to COVID-19. Likewise, Mr Desmond Choo and Ms Sylvia Lim raised points regarding the challenges of workers, in particular, women, face and how Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) can benefit employers, employees and the society in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>FWAs help workers better prepare and better balance their commitments at home and at work, and enable women to remain in the workforce, gain work experience, earn higher wages and assume leadership positions. MOM has been working with the tripartite partners to improve workers\\' access to FWAs, such as by providing support via the Work Life Grant (WLG) and recognising progressive employers through the Tripartite Standard on FWAs.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result of COVID-19, many more companies are working from home now and are benefiting from FWAs. We will seize the opportunity to continue this momentum and ensure that work-from-home arrangements are sustained beyond the COVID-19 period. This will not only strengthen business resilience; it will better support work-life harmony for all workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, ensuring workers\\' mental well-being. As more businesses gradually resume operations, workers will take some time to adjust to the new normal as well as different working arrangements. Since the start of COVID-19, there has been many changes and adjustments. We understand that workers may face additional stress, and some may have mental health challenges. I agree with Ms Anthea Ong that we must look into our workers\\' mental health as we also seek to protect as many jobs as possible during this challenging period.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Ong had suggested that we consider introducing additional requirements to qualify for JSS payouts. However, the intent of JSS is, as I have mentioned earlier, to help the companies retain and pay for local workers. It is to help as many companies stay afloat and keep jobs for Singaporeans. So, really, the JSS is a temporary scheme designed to help companies save jobs for Singaporeans during this period of economic uncertainty. Adding too many conditions would only make it more difficult for the employers to benefit from JSS or, inadvertently, cause a delay in employers getting the urgent help they need. Jobs may be lost if the employers do not get timely help.</p><p>Instead, we have been working on other ways to encourage our employers to implement progressive practices and workplace adjustments to take care of our workers\\' mental health needs in the workplace.&nbsp;</p><p>During the Committee of Supply (COS) in March, Ms Ong will remember that MOM announced that we will formulate a Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-being to educate our employers on basic mental health knowledge and make available the resources to help them. We will work with the tripartite partners to evaluate the possibility of including an Employee Assistance Programme as well as insurance coverage for mental health as part of the upcoming Tripartite Advisory, which will be finalised in the second half of this year.</p><p>We are also working closely with the various Government agencies and the Labour Movement to provide our employers with resources that can support their workers\\' mental well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Chairman, what I have just shared are ways in which we are supporting our workers and employers to overcome the challenges arising from COVID-19. During the circuit breaker, we have all come across many heart-warming and heartening stories of how businesses, workers and Singaporeans are rallying behind one another as one community. As we slowly reopen the economy and transit to a new normal, I am confident that the unity and the fortitude of our workers and the employers will see us through this crisis and help us emerge stronger together.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Clarifications. Ms Anthea Ong.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Mr Chairman, I thank Senior Parliamentary Secretary Low for her response. I would like to ask if the Senior Parliamentary Secretary could answer my question. Should there be a mechanism to make companies that are unaffected by or even profiting from the crisis return their JSS payouts? That is one. Secondly, I am very heartened that the Senior Parliamentary Secretary is reiterating that employees should come forward because they are protected under the Employment Act, if they have errant employers.</p><p>How are we actually making sure that this is made known, particularly to the more vulnerable employees, that they have this right? Many of them are sharing with me that they are so afraid to come forward because,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">first of all, they do not know they have this right and, secondly, they are worried about employers actually making life harder for them.</span></p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: The longer the question, the shorter the answer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: I will just keep it to two then, Mr Chairman, on your cue.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;You have 20 seconds.</p><p><strong>Ms Low Yen Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you. I want to thank the Member, Ms Anthea Ong, for her supplementary question. On the first one about whether there are companies profiteering from the crisis. Earlier on, I mentioned that the JSS is targeted to help companies retain and pay their local workers. In designing the JSS, MOF as well as MOM and the various Ministries sought to achieve a balance between targeted assistance and also administrative efficiency, because this is really a crisis period. You want to make sure that the help reach the intended target audience as expeditiously as possible and make sure that we save every job. So, we strike a good balance between targeted assistance and administrative efficiency in designing the JSS.</p><p>I would like to inform Ms Ong that a large percentage of our firms and local employees, as the Deputy Prime Minister has mentioned, will be severely impacted. And earlier on, when he reminded us that the JSS amounted to $23.5 billion protecting 1.9 million jobs, two-thirds of our SMEs benefit from this. It is really important to provide the support to them. So, the question the Member asked&nbsp;—</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Kindly wrap up, Ms Low.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Low Yen Ling</strong>: So, to identify and exclude individual employers from this scheme will certainly need another level or, in fact, a few levels of administrative operations to sift through, especially when the eventual economic impact to them remains uncertain. It may not be administratively efficient to do so. So, I just want to share the balance between providing the help in an efficient way to the target audience vis-a-vis operational complexity. Now, I also want to reassure Ms Ong —</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Low, can you just wrap up quickly?</p><p><strong>Ms Low Yen Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Yes. I want to assure Ms Ong that any irresponsible or unfair, fraudulent employment practises, including a false reporting of CPF contributions and so on will be dealt with severely and we will not hesitate to take actions accordingly. And we really urge the workers to report such errant employers. The Member will be familiar with our various programmes like Work Right and so on. We do have MOM officers going out not just to big companies, but also to small ones to share with them the rights of our workers, what are their rights under the Employment Act and how they would be protected. So, they need not fear because the Employment Act protects them, especially those who have been wrongfully dismissed.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Thank you.

Ms Anthea Ong.</p><h6><em>Gaps in COVID-19 Support Grant</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".</p><p>The Government has signalled that the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) is an important piece in the array of COVID-19 welfare schemes by pumping in $800 million as part of the Fortitude Budget. However, I would like to bring attention to several aspects of the scheme that obstruct it from fully meeting the needs of those who need it most.</p><p>First, its overly strict eligibility criteria. Applicants have to first show that they have lost or will lose income over three months. For those whose initial conditions of no pay leave or reduced income do not reflect at least three months, they will have to wait to become eligible for CSG. This will be the case for most employees, especially lower wage workers, many of whom who do not even have a document from their employers spelling out conditions of leave. It would be inconceivable to expect employers who lay off employees to provide a confirmation that the employee will have three months of income lost, nor is it logical to expect individuals to show loss of future income of at least three months now.</p><p>From May 2020, there is no interim support scheme that can help to tide such individuals over.&nbsp;Further, the amount and duration of support provided under CSG is ungenerous, especially when compared to the Self-employed Persons Income Relief Scheme (SIRS). Crucially, members of society in precarious positions are excluded from CSG, such as individuals with no bank account or daily-rated workers.</p><p>Hence, I recommend that the Government reduce the required period for involuntary no pay leave or duration of income loss from three consecutive months to one month and allow individuals with no bank account and daily-rated or ad hoc workers to be eligible for CSG. The duration of support should also be extended from three months to nine months or when applicants are able to secure a job, whichever is earlier.</p><p>If the Ministry disagrees, individuals who have been financially affected by COVID-19 will be forced to apply for ComCare financial assistance in the interim or after they have exhausted their full CSG payout. Given the almost five-fold difference in income eligibility criteria of CSG versus ComCare, will the Ministry consider enhancements to ComCare such as: (a) increasing the income eligibility caps for ComCare and (b) increasing the flexibility with regard to supporting documents required? For instance, instead of strictly requiring bank statements, one could be allowed to produce documents that show job or income loss.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Senior Parliamentary Secretary&nbsp;Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim.</p><p><strong>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim)</strong>: Mr Chairman, the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) supports lower to middle income Singaporeans or Permanent Residents who, as a result of the economic impact of COVID-19, are presently (a) involuntarily unemployed due to retrenchment or contract termination;&nbsp;(b) placed on involuntary no-pay leave (NPL) for at least three consecutive months; or (c) experiencing reduced monthly salary of at least 30% for at least three consecutive months.</p><p>While MSF provides support for affected employees through CSG, employees are also supported through the Jobs Support Scheme. Self-employed persons (SEPs) are mainly supported through the Self-employed Persons Income Relief Scheme or SIRS.&nbsp;</p><p>Employees who have lost their jobs can apply for CSG immediately without waiting for three months.&nbsp;</p><p>Employees who are placed on involuntary NPL or experiencing reduced monthly salary need not wait till they are affected for three consecutive months to apply. They are eligible for CSG if their NPL or salary loss has already started and they provide supporting documents, such as a letter from their employer, showing that the involuntary NPL or salary reduction will be for at least three consecutive months.&nbsp;The \"three or more consecutive months\" requirement for involuntary NPL and salary loss scenarios is to ensure that help is channelled to those who have greater needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Daily-rated and ad hoc workers may qualify for CSG if they meet the eligibility criteria. Workers who do not have employment contracts due to the nature of their work may approach their nearest Social Service Offices&nbsp;or SSOs to make a self declaration on their employment status. This includes daily-rated and ad hoc workers. SSOs will undertake further checks against applicants\\' past CPF records and facilitate their CSG application if they qualify. Individuals eligible for CSG and without bank accounts can approach SSOs for assistance.</p><p>Those who are ineligible for CSG and are in financial need can apply for ComCare, which provides financial assistance for basic living expenses and other support such as household bill expenses and medical expenses. In general, those who are newly placed on ComCare will receive at least six months of assistance, which provides them with a longer runway to regain stability.</p><p>For those with urgent financial needs, SSOs, grassroots organisations and Family Service Centres can provide them with ComCare Interim Assistance.</p><p>ComCare&nbsp;Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) and Interim Assistance have income eligibility criteria of a monthly household income of $1,900 and below or per capita household income of $650 and below.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Parliamentary Secretary&nbsp;Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, please wrap up.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;These are not hard thresholds and each case is considered on its own merit. Supporting documents including bank statements and payslips enable SSOs to accurately assess the applicants\\' circumstances, savings and needs. SSOs exercise flexibility as needed to provide the necessary financial assistance and social support. SSOs can conduct their interviews and assessments electronically and applicants can submit their supporting documents via email.</p><p>While CSG is open for applications from May 2020 till September 2020, the Government will continue to review our support schemes for those who need help, taking into account how the COVID-19 situation evolves.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Ong, would you like to withdraw the amendment, please?</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Thank you, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, for your response.

(proc text)]</p><h6>6.45 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".</p><p>This Bill comes before Parliament in the midst of very serious challenges faced by us, which both Ministers and Members of Parliament have spoken about a number of times.</p><p>In my speech, I will explain why we need this intervention, explain the principles behind the Bill and set out the key features of the Bill.</p><p>Just under two months ago, I moved an urgent Bill in this House – the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill, which I will refer to as “COVID 1”. COVID 1 was, in itself, a major intervention.</p><p>In my speech then, I explained why intervention was needed – economic shock, unprecedented in magnitude in terms of impact and the speed with which the impact was felt.</p><p>I also set out the principles for such intervention. The starting point is always the sanctity of contract – a fundamental, key aspect of the rule of law and we do not lightly intervene.&nbsp;</p><p>But sanctity of contract cannot be an absolute. I said that intervention is needed when the core interests of our people are at stake and there is a need to safeguard the fundamental integrity of the economic structure for the common good. Such intervention has to be reasonable and of generally limited duration.</p><p>In COVID 1, we put in what I called a “legal circuit breaker”. It provided a framework to hold in abeyance the strict enforcement of certain legal rights for a period of time.&nbsp;</p><p>The objective was to give businesses some cash flow relief and breathing space to make adjustments. For example, if a business tenant is unable to pay rent during the relief period because of COVID-19, the landlord cannot evict the tenant during the relief period. The moratorium runs until 19 October 2020.</p><p>At the time, I emphasised that COVID 1 only deferred contractual obligations. I also explained to this House that the Bill gave businesses breathing space. It also gave the Government some time to take in feedback, assess the evolving situation, conduct a deeper analysis and decide whether more substantive interventions were needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past two months, we have done precisely that. We have monitored feedback, assessed the situation, thought carefully about what else needed to be done. And we have decided to intervene in a more substantive way to deal with the issue of rent. And also, intervene in some other areas. I will explain why.&nbsp;</p><p>Two months ago, the circuit breaker began. For many, including the businesses most affected by those measures, April now feels like a lifetime away.</p><p>Globally, we were looking at 1.2 million infections and 67, 000 dead. As of 1 June, we are looking at more than 6 million infections and more than 370,000 dead.</p><p>Various restrictions had already been put in place by then, but the circuit breaker caused a substantial increase in the restrictions.</p><p>The situation today? The Deputy Prime Minister and other Ministers have explained in considerable detail.&nbsp;</p><p>I will just recap two key points. The economic situation and outlook has deteriorated substantially. MTI is now forecasting a contraction of between 4% and 7%. And there is a lot of uncertainty.</p><p>We are taking a cautious approach in lifting the circuit breaker measures. Many industries are affected. And for some, the impact has been near catastrophic.</p><p>Latest data from the Department of Statistics, some just released today. If you look at F&amp;B sales in March 2020, they declined by 23.7%. In April 2020, they declined by 53% on a year-on-year basis. Retail sales, if you exclude supermarkets, hypermarkets and convenience stalls, retail sales in March 2020 declined by 13.3%. In April 2020, nearly 61%.&nbsp;</p><p>These numbers do not even show the full impact of the circuit breaker because data for May 2020 is not out yet. We can, obviously, expect the numbers to be very weak.</p><p>Revenue has fallen but meanwhile fixed costs continue. For many businesses, in the F&amp;B, retail sector, two significant components of such costs are manpower and rent.</p><p>As regards manpower, the Government through the various Budgets has put in the Jobs Support Scheme, waived the Foreign Worker Levy and put in a number of other schemes to help, together with partners like NTUC.</p><p>This Bill seeks to deal with the rental obligations, amongst other things.</p><p>Many landlords have taken a helpful approach and a long-term view. They have shared the burden with their tenants.</p><p>Nevertheless , we received a lot of feedback from struggling SMEs that they need more time to recover. Many cannot operate until Phase Two, and even then only partially.</p><p>Landlords’ concessions have been uneven. Many landlords have rendered substantive assistance, but several others have not.</p><p>The point is that accumulated arrears should be handled fairly.&nbsp;</p><p>I will share one piece of feedback as an illustration. This is a tenant who is a mother of two young children. She started a company two years ago, providing enrichment lessons to children. She leased some space for the business as a sub-tenant. She renewed her lease for one year, just before COVID-19 hit.&nbsp;</p><p>All revenue that came in went to support the business – payment of rent, salaries for trainers and other operational costs. But from February 2020, parents began to keep students away. Classes have been suspended since March 2020. Her landlord has offered her 10% discount for April and May 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>COVID-19 is quite an unforeseeable event, both in magnitude and speed of impact. It is wiping out the hard work that many people have put in into their businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>So, if landlords insist on payments that tenants cannot afford, tenants will have to give up. Landlords then have to take their chances to recover something in the insolvency proceedings, together with other creditors.</p><p>Landlords will then also have to find replacement tenants. In this market, not realistic.</p><p>Therefore, it is in everyone’s interests to take a sensible approach, ensure everyone comes out of this together, ready to recover.</p><p>If you look at restaurant booking platform Chope, they did a survey: 81% of their respondents said they would not be able to operate beyond the next six months, based on cost and revenue that they had during the circuit breaker period.</p><p>After watching all of this carefully, taking in the feedback, looking at the numbers that were coming in, we decided that there is a need for a substantive intervention.</p><p>The challenge that rent poses to small businesses, is not a problem unique to Singapore. A number of other countries have seen that and they have intervened. I will just give the examples of Australia and Germany.</p><p>In Australia, landlords are required to offer rent waivers and deferrals to SME tenants. And SME tenants are allowed to repay the deferred rent over a period of at least 24 months, interest-free.&nbsp;</p><p>In Germany, landlords are not allowed to terminate a tenancy for non-payment of rent. And arrears with accumulated interest can be repaid before 30 June 2022; that means, two years of extension.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me now move, Mr Speaker, to the premises underlying this Bill. What is necessary in this situation is a fair sharing of obligations because of the exceptional times that are before us. The fair sharing has got to be between the Government, the landlords and the tenants.</p><p>On the Government’s part, you have seen four Budgets amounting to almost $93 billion, including two months\\' rental assistance for retail, F&amp;B tenants; one month for office and industrial tenants, as well as broad salary support and other credit-easing facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>So, if you look at the rest of the burden, what is a fair sharing of the remainder between landlords and tenants? And the related question is, will the market left to itself be able to find an equilibrium that reflects the principle of fairness?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The answer to these two related questions depends on a number of points.</p><p>First, all Singaporeans, including landlords, have a shared interest in seeing our SMEs do well. Second, in a climate like this, expecting market forces to push towards a fair equilibrium is not realistic. Third, what is the alternative if we do not intervene?</p><p>SMEs play, as I have said, a critical role in the Singapore economy. In 2019, the 260,000 SMEs in Singapore contributed to 45% of our GDP and 72% of our employment.</p><p>If many of our SMEs for whom a stable cash flow is fundamental, are unable to survive, the domino effect on the rest of the economy will be very substantial and a lot of jobs will be at stake. Our people will suffer.</p><p>For landlords, their asset value will be affected by the broader economy. There is a clear correlation between growth of property prices and economic growth. If our SMEs do well, the economy is given a boost, property owners will continue to enjoy the stable value of their assets. If viable SMEs go under because of temporary cash flow difficulties, the economy as a whole suffers, the value of property will also suffer.</p><p>So, the essential point: everyone has a stake in the viability of the SMEs.&nbsp;</p><p>My third and final point is: go back to the eligibility criteria. They cover SME renting commercial, industrial or office space for the operation of their business and those with a turnover of not more than S$100 million per annum and where they had a reduction in turnover of more than 35%, which is a substantial hit.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Order.

       "   'content': '<p>[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Minister, please resume.</p><h6>6.59 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Thank you, Sir.&nbsp;Let me now take Members through the key features of the Bill.</p><p>The Bill has three key aspects.&nbsp;First, landlords will be required to ensure that the benefits of Governments assistance are given to the actual, intended beneficiaries. That is, the SME tenants operating in rented premises and this will include licencees.</p><p>Second, landlords may also be required to provide a further waiver of up to two months’ of rent to qualifying SME tenants.</p><p>And third, SMEs who qualify for the rental waiver will also be given time to repay some of their remaining rental arrears, at an interest rate that will be capped.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As said earlier, most of these reliefs apply to SME tenants, including sub-tenants and licencees.</p><p>The rental relief framework will also apply to eligible Non-Profit Organisations and eligible tenants of Government properties.&nbsp;</p><p>The Deputy Prime Minister announced property tax rebates from the Resilience and Unity Budgets. The Government will be providing approximately two months of rental assistance for eligible SME tenants of qualifying commercial properties and approximately one month of rental assistance for eligible SME tenants of other non-residential properties; basically, industrial and office properties.</p><p>This will be done via rental waivers, granted by landlords.</p><p>Agencies are working out the details, which will give landlords clarity on the relief that they are required to offer; and give tenants clarity on the relief that they will get. This will be set out in subsidiary legislation.</p><p>The Bill will require landlords to match what the Government is doing. They will be required to grant qualifying SME commercial tenants an additional waiver of two months’ rental, of base rent; and qualifying SME industrial and office tenants an additional one month’s waiver of base rent.</p><p>This additional relief will apply to SME tenants who have suffered at least a 35% drop in average monthly revenue in April and May 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This will be calculated at the rental unit or outlet level.&nbsp;</p><p>Tenants must have entered into their tenancy before 25 March 2020, or extended such a tenancy to get this relief.&nbsp;</p><p>There are smaller landlords who face genuine hardship. For example, retirees who have purchased a small commercial property, and the rental yield from that property forms a very large proportion of their income. For this group, they may seek an assessment on grounds of financial hardship. The assessment will take into consideration the annual value of the landlord’s properties, and whether the rental income forms a substantial part of his or her total income.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Qualifying landlords will only be required to give half of the additional rental waivers. And we will set out the criteria for landlords to qualify for this in subsidiary legislation.</p><p>During our consultations, stakeholders have asked for clarity on a few matters. Landlords wanted more clarity on when their obligations will be triggered. Tenants wanted clarity on when they will be entitled to the relief.</p><p>For the landlords, their obligations will be triggered when IRAS issues the notice of the cash grant or nominal notice to eligible property owners. IRAS will provide more details of the cash grant on its website, once it works the details out.</p><p>Meanwhile, to preserve the status quo, the Bill provides for a moratorium on enforcement action for non-payment of rent in the time between the Act coming into force and the triggering of the landlords’ obligations.&nbsp;</p><p>Even before the Act comes into force, tenants who are unable to pay their rent and require protection from eviction can serve a Notification for Relief under COVID 1, as it exists today.</p><p>Second, we recognise that many landlords may have already given relief. This could be in the form of rental waivers or rebates. These landlords will be able to set off the equivalent value against the amount of waiver that they are required to give under the Bill.</p><p>The kinds of reliefs that landlords have given and which can be taken into account for this purpose will be set out in subsidiary legislation.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, what if the tenant has already paid the rent for the months in which relief is meant to be granted or for the months for which relief is meant to be granted? In such a situation, the landlord will be required to credit any amounts already paid to the tenant. This may be in the form of the waiver being applied in the next month of rent that is due. If the lease is coming to an end, the landlord will have to provide a refund to the eligible tenant.&nbsp;</p><p>Fourth, MAS has separately announced some additional relief from banks and finance companies in relation to landlords’ existing loan repayment obligations. Individual landlords who have been required to provide relief to their tenants under this Bill can apply to defer both principal and interest payments on their commercial and industrial property loans till the end of the year. So, if moratorium is given until October for tenants; landlords will get assistance from their financial institutions.</p><p>They can also apply for an extension of loan tenure by up to the corresponding deferment period to make the monthly instalments more manageable.</p><p>SME landlords who face financial difficulties can already apply to defer the principal repayments on their mortgages under the industry relief package that MAS announced some weeks ago.</p><p>Larger landlords can likewise work with their banks and finance companies if they require assistance.</p><p>Those who need to access additional credit to meet their immediate cashflow needs can either apply for mortgage equity withdrawal loans or loans under ESG’s Temporary Bridging Loan Programme or Working Capital Loan Scheme, if they qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>SME tenants who are eligible for the additional relief described above can also get relief under the third plank of the Bill. They will be allowed to defer payment of a part of the rental arrears accrued from 1 February, until 19 October 2020. They will have to start repaying the arrears from November 2020. These arrears, of course, do not include, for example, the four months which have been waived – these are no longer payable.</p><p>Tenants can elect to repay their rental arrears in equal instalments, with payment of the first instalment to start no later than November 2020 and that can be done during the duration of the remaining term of their tenancy, up to a maximum of nine months, with interest capped at 3% per annum. If the tenancy is shorter, then, it has got to be paid during the term of the tenancy.</p><p>For commercial properties, the maximum amount of arrears that can be paid in instalments, will be five months’ base rent. For industrial and office properties, the maximum amount of arrears that can be paid in instalments will be four months’ base rent.</p><p>This means that landlords take on some credit risk. As a safeguard, we will provide that all outstanding arrears, including interest and other charges, will be accelerated and immediately payable in accordance with the terms of the original contract, if instalment payments under the scheme are not paid within the prescribed time after they become due; or if the tenant terminates or repudiates his lease agreement during the rescheduled repayment period; or if the lease agreement is terminated due to other defaults by the tenant.&nbsp;</p><p>Landlords may also draw the existing security deposits to offset accumulated rental arrears during the repayment period. They may do so, until there is the equivalent of at least one month of rent remaining in the security deposit.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the repayment period, the tenant will be obliged to reinstate the security deposit, as provided in the contract.</p><p>In addition, we will require tenant who have rescheduled the payment of arrears, to provide specified documents and information to their landlords if the lease agreement is: one, terminated or repudiated during the repayment period; and two, there are two or more rescheduled repayment instalments outstanding.</p><p>The documents and information to be provided will include filing a statutory declaration on their statement of accounts from April 2020 until the termination or repudiation of the licence. The tenant will also be required to set out how he proposes to repay the outstanding rental arrears.</p><p>This will ensure transparency and accountability, but only in respect of tenants who terminate and have at least two months of the repayments instalments outstanding.</p><p>If any criminal behaviour is revealed – for example, if the tenant was using the period of relief to fraudulently dissipate assets – then there could be criminal sanctions. Tenants will also be expected to negotiate in good faith the terms of repayment.</p><p>Any Court, when deciding whether the conduct is criminal, will likely take into account the totality of the conduct.</p><p>We have also heard concerns from the REITs about potential constraints on their operating income and cashflow. REITs are concerned that they may be liable for additional tax and that their abilities to meet financial covenants in bank loan agreements could be affected. They also worry that this could have a knock-on impact on S-REIT investors and the S-REIT industry as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>We discussed this matter carefully with MOF, IRAS, MAS, the banks. MOF and IRAS have temporarily extended timelines for the distribution of taxable income by S-REITs to qualify for tax transparency treatment. Leverage limits for S-REITs have also been increased from 45% to 50%. This will give S-REITs more flexibility to manage their cash flows and prevent them from incurring additional tax expenses.</p><p>Corporate landlords, which include S-REITs, can also approach their banks or finance companies to explore funding if they face cashflow issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Banks have also assured MAS that there will be no automatic enforcement of loan covenant breaches for landlords impacted by the requirements under this Bill.</p><p>Besides cash-flow difficulties, what has been happening in the industry is that people face difficulties in a variety of other ways. For example, take tenants whose tenancies expired or were expiring during circuit breaker period who had difficulties moving out because they were not allowed to go back to the office or shop to pack up or they could not find any movers or they are delayed because they cannot find workers to carry out the work, to put the place back to the original condition.</p><p>In such cases, it would be unfair for the tenant to have to pay double rent or similar charges under the contract or the law. The Bill allows us to deal with these situations, through subsidiary legislation.</p><p>We will provide that a tenant who cannot vacate the premises due to COVID-19 may serve an NFR under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. And the tenant will be protected from enforcement. In addition, the tenant will not be liable for double rent.</p><p>In some situations, it might be fair for the tenant to pay some amount, especially if the tenant continued to derive benefit from the premises. We will prescribe the circumstances and how that amount can be assessed.</p><p>Finally, we have also received feedback that stoppage of construction work has led to difficulties. There are also difficulties with supply-related contracts. These difficulties have also been caused to contracting parties, who may not themselves be parties to a construction or supply contract.</p><p>For example, a developer who has entered into a contract to fit out an office may be unable to do so within the timeline stipulated in the contract because of COVID-19 restrictions on construction work. That would expose the developer to liquidated damages for failure to deliver the fitted out office on time, through no fault of the developer.&nbsp;</p><p>The second example, say the tenant has entered into a tenancy agreement which provides for a three-month rent-free period for the purposes of renovation and fitting out, but is unable to proceed with construction works due to the COVID-19 restrictions, effectively losing the benefit of the rent-free period entirely.</p><p>The third example, a live example, a company, say Company A rents scaffolding materials from Company B, until 14 April for a project. When the circuit breaker kicked in on 7 April, Company A could not return scaffolding materials because of the circuit breaker. Company B says it is going to charge for an additional month of hiring fee.&nbsp;</p><p>In these cases, the affected parties are not parties to the construction contract but they are parties to contracts that are nevertheless affected by the stoppage in construction work or other circuit breaker measures.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bill therefore provides a mechanism for parties in some of these contracts to seek relief. They will be allowed to apply to an Assessor, who may then make a determination to either adjust the manner in which prescribed obligations are to be performed; or vary a prescribed term in a contract in order to achieve a just and equitable outcome.</p><p>The precise scope of contracts, the obligations to be covered and the kinds of adjustments that Assessors may make will be set out with more clarity in subsidiary legislation. A similar approach will be taken for supply related contracts.</p><p>Let me now quickly touch on some on the other amendments.</p><p>COVID 1 was passed and came into force in April this year. As of 1 June, we have had more than 4,000 Notifications for Relief and about 500 applications for determinations have been filed. During this period, we have observed that the operation of the Act has been effective. The fact that out of the 4,000 Notifications, only slightly more than 10% have come forward, suggests that most of the others had managed to settle it.</p><p>And because of the clarity of the previous Act, our understanding is that a lot of people have managed to deal with their issues along the lines provided for in the legislation without having to even file an NFR.</p><p>But we have been talking to the Assessors to get feedback on how it is working. So, we are making some clarificatory amendments.</p><p>For example, the information and matters disclosed in the course of proceedings before an Assessor, are to be kept confidential.</p><p>For late payment, payment arrears and interests that accumulate during the relief period under COVID 1, we will put a cap on how much late payment interest there can be. The cap will not apply to secured loan facilities given to SMEs, as well as hire purchase agreements taken out with banks and finance companies.</p><p>MAS has worked with banks and finance companies on various relief measures to support individuals and businesses affected by COVID-19. These measures include principal repayment deferments for SME secured loans and hire purchase agreements. Borrowers can also extend their loan tenure to spread out their loan repayments over a longer period.&nbsp;</p><p>Banks and finance companies will also take into account their borrowers’ repayment ability after the relief period and adjust repayment plans if necessary.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now conclude. The reliefs contained in this Bill will have substantial impact. All in all, up to 260,000 SMEs may benefit from the Government rental assistance. There are an estimated 31,000 SMEs in the F&amp;B and retail sectors. They, their employees will benefit from the additional relief that is being granted.&nbsp;</p><p>We are moving this Bill to help our SMEs. We hope that businesses will be able to make good use of the easing of pressure to focus on transforming and levelling up to thrive in our new operating environment. And a large number of office and industrial tenants will also benefit.</p><p>While it is unusual, let me conclude by saying a little about the process for preparing this Bill, which runs into about 40 pages or so. At first sight it looks simple enough: two months plus two months. But it is actually quite complex. Just to take one point: how do you pass down the waiver of rental relief through three or four layers of intermediate landlords? What happens if one of them is a non SME? And multiple questions of that sort. And when does it take effect? When would the landlords give the reliefs and to whom? And how do you handle the moratorium and the best balance between the different interests.</p><p>And the aspects relating to smaller landlords, REITs, the types of tenants who should qualify. And of course, the other contracts that should be dealt with in a myriad of situations.</p><p>It was a significant effort to conceptualise, crystallise, get the feedback from different stakeholders, take in the feedback and then, draft the legislation in about three weeks.</p><p>I saw the best of the Public Service: how different agencies came together, worked round the clock. MTI and ESG gave us the data which allowed us to work out where the balance ought to be, who ought to qualify. They attended all our meetings, including with stakeholders, helped to tweak our proposals and also worked their own loan schemes, and identified for us how the loan schemes may help.</p><p>MAS played a crucial role in re-assuring the REITs as well as the landlords, and talking to the banks. They also attended all the meetings, including stakeholder meetings. IRAS, MCCY, MHA, MND, HDB, JTC.</p><p>If I can say this – all roads lead to MOF and all roads lead from MOF as well. They attended all our meetings, very supportive, facilitated and agreed to pay for the bill.</p><p>The private sector lawyers: Patrick Ang and Sushil Nair. I mentioned them during COVID 1. They did a lot of work here as well. The Committee members – I will put it as part of the record of my speech without having to mention all of them. [<em>Please refer to </em><a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/annex-Annex.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Annex 1</i></a><em>.</em>]</p><p>Different stakeholders, if I can put a note down for the exceptional team in MinLaw, they put their heart and soul into this, led by the Permanent Secretary and Deputy Secretary, a team of highly motivated and talented young officers, worked round the clock. And Justice Kannan Ramesh and his valuable expertise was very useful for us. And finally, AGC. The three lawyers: Lee Chuan Huei, Hema Subramanian and Leong Kit Yu who worked until 5.00 am regularly for the entire two weeks.</p><p>This legislation could not have been drafted in most places in three weeks, let alone conceptualise, crystallise and draft, led by our Attorney-General, Mr Lucien Wong.</p><p>I said some things about him during the Second Reading of COVID 1. I was trying to be understated. I think it helped tremendously that we had one of the best corporate lawyers in the world helping us from day one, word for word, conceptualising it, checking every word. I think Singapore is extremely fortunate to have him in Public Service. Checking everything and making sure that it works, and again, working into the early morning hours, every day. Attorney-Generals do not do that in most places. But it gave me a lot of confidence that he was doing that.</p><p>So, in this Bill, preparing it, we saw the best of the Public Service at work – coming together, working for the benefit of the broader public.</p><p>I wish to thank them and put on record their contributions.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>7.22 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, a main aim of this Bill is to support SMEs. SMEs are important to our economy. They are responsible for the employment of more than 70% of our country\\'s workforce, about two million workers.&nbsp;However, during the circuit breaker, many have been left with empty offices or shops that rack up rent, incurring costs. This does not account for other operating costs, such as manpower costs. Reducing the costs that SMEs face will in turn help them support their workers.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the main thrusts of the Bill is instituting rental waivers for SMEs, co-paid by the Government and the landlord. The period is four months for SME tenants at commercial properties for the months of April to July and two months for those in industrial and office properties for the months of April to May. This is good as it targets a significant expenditure many of our SMEs face and targets the period where SMEs are most adversely affected.</p><p>According to news reports, one important criterion is that there must be a 35% fall in average monthly revenue from April to May 2020 compared to the same period last year. Such targeted help is good. It is fairer that landlords not have to take haircuts if their tenants\\' revenues had not been adversely affected. Would the Minister clarify what happens if the company was a new company or a new tenant such that the comparison to the previous year is either impossible or is an inaccurate comparison?&nbsp;</p><p>Then, there is the landlord. From various news articles on this Bill, it looks to be that there is some distinction being drawn between large corporations and less large landlords through the use of the phrase \"financial hardship\". This is good as the considerations and ability to bear the \"pain\", so to speak, differs between smaller private landlords compared to large corporations. I would like to request of the Minister that a wide range of financial hardship should be considered as smaller landlords can also find themselves in vulnerable situations.&nbsp;</p><p>Just yesterday, Sir, 4 June 2020, I received an well-crafted email from a resident of Ulu Pandan. And I quote from that email, and this is to support the point that I am making about the need to differentiate between different types of landlords.&nbsp;</p><p>In that email, my resident wrote, \"Dear Mr de Souza,&nbsp;I hope this letter finds you well in these tough times.&nbsp;I would like to seek your advice regarding one of the Government\\'s new Bills, the one which would mandate a four-month rent free period for tenants, paid for equally by the Government and landlords. I would like to ask if the Government has any plans to differentiate between large landlords of significant capital reserves as compared to small family-owned companies.&nbsp;I am currently living on monthly rental revenue and honestly, I would not get to keep much of it after the banks take their due.&nbsp;It is my sincere wish that the Government would take into account of those in my position when discussing the proposed Bill.</p><p>Given the current economic situation, landlords in my position are already facing problems with rent collection as well as waivers and haircuts demanded by our tenants. To further absorb an additional two months of rent would be too much for many to bear. Of course, I begrudge not the tenants for their plight. COVID-19 is a natural and unexpected disaster that strikes at all levels of society. I just hope that they would try to understand that investing our savings into property should not entail a different treatment than those who invested in other forms of assets.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I am thankful of the Government’s courage and decisiveness in drawing down on reserves so as to combat these unprecedented financial challenges. In times of crisis, we as a society must come together and help our neighbours as best we can. I only hope that we would be allowed to contribute according to our means.\"</p><p>I spoke with my resident this morning before coming to Parliament over the phone and I said I would definitely raise his well-worded point of view in Parliament this afternoon.</p><p>Drawing from my resident\\'s message, the point I am making is this.</p><p>One, yes, I support the help given to tenants. Certainly. Two, the support is timely and needed. But three, we need a flexible system to differentiate between large corporate landlords and the landlords who have invested in small commercial shophouses and spaces as a form of, say, retirement income. It is for this reason that I am asking the Minister for \"financial hardship\" to be defined broadly and flexibly to strike the right balance, between the smaller landlords and the larger corporate landlords. And I hope the Minister would be able to expand on this request of mine in the good Minister\\'s reply.</p><p>Onto another point, Sir.&nbsp;It has been mentioned that direct monetary assistance previously rendered by the landlord to the tenant can be counted as part of the landlord\\'s contribution to rental waiver. Would the Minister clarify whether agreeing to lower the rent, and not waiving rent, is also considered direct monetary assistance? And if so, whether the rental waiver support from the Government and also the landlords\\' contribution to the rental waiver will be calculated based on rent pre-reduction or the newly agreed rent?&nbsp;</p><p>While the law has tried to strike a balance between the landlords and the tenants, it can only go so far in achieving an outcome that all parties will find mutually acceptable in the long-run. Landlords and tenants need each other and I hope that they will continue to have constructive discussions to support each other through this unprecedented crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>It was reported that landlords can apply for assessment as to whether the SME is eligible and that eligible tenants will be notified in due course. It may be in the words of the draft Bill, but would the tenant also have access to the mechanism of assessing whether one, the landlord is indeed one that faces financial hardship or two, whether or not they are indeed an eligible tenant.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides rental waivers, the Bill also provides for rental repayment schemes to allow rent to be repaid in installments instead. Would the Minister clarify as to whether eligibility of this rental repayment scheme depends on whether the tenant had previously defaulted pre-COVID-19 or not? Further, what will be done to ameliorate the knock-on effect such deferment has on private individual landlords who would face financial hardship owing to the lack of cashflow?&nbsp;</p><p>For tenants who are unable to move out, there is a change to the normal law of tenancy in saying that landlords will not get double rent for the period of holding over. Will the Minister clarify as to how this will interact with rental waivers?</p><p>I should mention, Mr Speaker, that I am an advocate in private practice and I sometimes do have to delve in landlord-tenant disputes – just wanted to put that on the record.</p><p>The second main thrust of the Bill is that relating to contracts other than rents. The Bill looks to cap late payment interest, charges for arrears and so on. I welcome the reduction and limitation of late payment interest as this will help reduce snowballing debt.&nbsp;</p><p>The last clarification I want to seek of the Minister is whether further adjustments will be made to the insolvency framework so that non-viable businesses can still exit smoothly. For example, where a business owner has made the hard decision to stop his trade in these times and seeks to venture into a new trade to overcome the difficult economic environment presented by the pandemic.</p><p>In conclusion, Sir, the MinLaw team, along with other Ministries and agencies such as the Attorney-General Chambers have thought out of the box and pushed through this exceptional legislation in double quick time, if not in triple quick time. Indeed, sanctity of contract and the avoidance of retrospective measures are what we should all aspire to to ensure the certainty of the bargain struck by two contracting parties. But, Sir, these are unprecedented times. MinLaw has acted swiftly. This Bill, if passed, will reduce the pain businesses are feeling. And if it can reduce retrenchments; if it can help keep wages from being cut or further cut; if it strikes the right balance between tenant and landlord, if it gives that needed life buoy, as we come out of the circuit breaker and into the gradual reopening of the economy, then I say the effort is worth it, and the Bill should be supported.</p><h6>7.33 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)</strong>: Mr Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic and the circuit breaker measures have had significant impact on businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last two months, I have received many appeals for assistance from my residents who are SME business owners as they are facing cashflow problems. The retail sector has been amongst the hardest hit as they have had to close their physical premises. While some of them have been able to move their business online, overall business still has been impacted. In the meantime, there are business costs and obligations still to be met and they still have to be paid.</p><p>The latest Department of Statistics data has also shown that in April there has been a dramatic drop in performance of 40.5% and this is the largest since 1986.&nbsp;</p><p>For many SMEs, rent is a large part of the business cost making up about 25% to 30% of overall business cost. Even as some businesses are able to start and reopen this week, they are not able to resume pre-COVID levels of operations immediately, and business demand will likely remain low.</p><p>The Bill seeks to help SMEs ease some of the burden by ensuring that their accumulated rental obligations are shared among the Government and landlords.&nbsp;</p><p>The interventions in the Bill are quite substantive as it mandates that landlords will have to waive rent for SME tenants. For eligible SME tenants in commercial properties, the landlords are required to waive two months of rent and tenants of industrial and office properties will receive one month’s waiver of rent. The Bill also requires landlords to pass the Government granted tax rebates in cash grants as part of the Fortitude Budget to the SME tenants.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bill does take a targeted approach and is reasonable. It does not apply across the board to all SMEs and businesses. Eligibility for the relief are for SMEs with less than $100 million turnover that rent premises for their businesses and are facing cashflow difficulties as a result of COVID-19. So, to be eligible, SMEs also have to fulfil two other criteria of a 35% or more drop in average monthly revenue from April to May on a year-on-year basis, and the tenancy must have been entered before March 25 of this year</p><p>Landlords are also not required to help larger SME tenants who may have better access to financing or tenants who have seen an increase in business during the period such as supermarkets.</p><p>Can Minister share if there has been an assessment of whether the rental relief measures will unnecessarily prolong the exit of unviable businesses, or benefit such businesses at the cost of landlords and taxpayers’ monies?</p><p>The rental reliefs do weigh in favour of tenants. At this point, I do want to declare my interest as I am a board member of a commercial REIT. Minister did mention that other stakeholders, including landlords and REITs, have been consulted. Minister has also shared that some of the views and concerns of these stakeholders who have been impacted are being addressed? For example, the cashflow difficulties that have been expressed as well as the measures and mechanisms are being put in place to support these landlords.&nbsp;</p><p>While I am supportive of this amendment Bill, I am concerned that landlords may face financial hardship as a result of the additional rental waiver they have to provide to SME tenants.&nbsp;For some of the smaller landlords, they may be dependent on the rental income to meet their own financial obligations.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bill does state that for landlords who face difficulties in providing the additional waiver to SME tenants, it does provide some reprieve. The landlords though will still have&nbsp;– if they are eligible for that reprieve&nbsp;– will still have to pay half of that obligation. And the landlords if they seek assessments on grounds of financial hardship, the assessments will take into consideration if the rental income forms a substantial part of their total income and the annual value of their properties. Is that how it is going to be assessed? And can Minister also share the assessment process and also how long that would take?&nbsp;</p><p>SMEs play a crucial role in Singapore’s economy making up a majority of companies and do provide employment for more than two million Singaporeans. So I do agree that SME tenants do need support during these tough times as they have been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The rental reliefs will allow the SMEs the space to recover and in turn save jobs. So, I support the Bill.</p><h6>7.39 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I join the hon Members who spoke before me to support the amendment Bill.</p><p>The hon Minister for Law took pains to outline the exceptional circumstances warranting intervention in the area of rent payable by SMEs as an exception against the principle of sanctity of contract. I fully agree with him. We are dealing with survival of SME tenants that employ a substantial number of Singaporeans. We cannot afford to just depend on each individual landlord to determine what concessions should be granted to the tenants’ whose businesses are massively haemorrhaging. Such actions would be too slow and uneven and livelihoods will be at stake.</p><p>I must however acknowledge and commend the actions of a good number of landlords who took unilateral action to help the tenants.&nbsp;For these landlords, I am glad to note that the amendment Bill is worded in a way that would take into account what these landlords unilaterally have done in assessing what further relief should be given by them to these tenants. Whilst small businesses will be the immediate beneficiaries under the amendment Bill, in the long run, as hon Minister mentioned, this amendment Bill actually protects the landlord’s interest too because it will ensure that the tenant’s market will not collapse. So, just like COVID 1, this should not be seen as an anti-landlord bill.</p><p>Before moving on, I would like to applaud the consultation undertaken by the officers of MinLaw and all the other Government agencies that the hon Minister mentioned in coming up with this Bill. They worked, in the words of the hon Member Mr Christoper de Souza, \"triple time\" in taking consultation from the ground, identifying the big bug bear that SMEs have and providing concrete solutions through this Bill.</p><p>Turning to the amendment Bill, I seek clarification on three areas and will end with a suggestion.</p><p>First, on the benefits that the sub-tenants will get under the amendment Bill. As I recall, during the Second Reading of COVID 1, the hon Minister for National Development, Mr Lawrence Wong stated that tenants are not mandated to pass on property tax rebate to sub-tenants. He explained that the reason for not mandating this is because, in his words, “there is a whole range of commercial arrangements” and there is no contractual relationship between the property owner and sub-tenant.</p><p>As I understand, the Government under this Bill is prepared to pay cash grant to sub-tenants if they are in possession of the properties. If the sub-tenants do not get the flow through of the benefit of the property tax rebate, based on my understanding, they will get a lower amount than the tenants in possession. Will this also affect the rebate that these sub-tenants get from their landlord? Because as I understand from the hon Minister\\'s speech, the Government&nbsp;– for commercial tenants&nbsp;– will give two months\\' rental rebate and then the landlords will follow up with two months. There is a bit of a principle of reciprocity in action. So, will this affect what the sub-tenant will get?</p><p>Next, on clause 7 of the Amendment Bill, I note that it is proposed that a tenant who is holding over a property after the expiry of a tenancy owing to a COVID-19 event will not be liable to the landlord. I welcome this amendment. It makes eminent sense to provide such relief. The control measures in place would make it difficult for the tenant to vacate premises, restore the property to its original state and yield vacant possession to the landlord.</p><p>May I ask whether there is a corollary provision to protect the landlord who may have a back-to-back arrangement with a new tenant under which he has to deliver vacant possession on the original due date? Such tenants may not be able to rely on COVID 1 if they entered into this lease after the trigger dates. For example, if they enter into the lease after 25 of March 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;In this regard, I note that in the amendment Bill, a Part 8 is proposed to provide relief to parties to downstream contracts affected by delay in performance or breach of a construction contract, supply contract or related contract. It does not appear that Part 8 applies to leases.</p><p>If my understanding is correct, may I please ask why leases, or for that matter, all the other scheduled contracts are excluded? As a matter of policy, I think it would have been better if parties in affected contracts that suffer a knock on effect arising from the application of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act on scheduled contracts should also have recourse under this Act.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, I note that in addition to the rental relief, the Amendment Bill also provides for a statutory repayment schedule for accumulated rental arrears commencing from the month of November 2020 in equal installments. I support this additional measure. The hon Minister refers to this as the third plank.&nbsp;I further note that the landlords will not be able to charge contractual interest beyond the prescribed rate on the outstanding rent. This makes sense as it would otherwise whittle the effect of the rental reliefs that are being provided under this amendment Bill.</p><p>The hon Minister mentioned that the prescribed rate is no more than 3% per annum. May I please ask the basis upon which this 3% interest rate is arrived at and also, what would be the applicable time period for this interest rate to run?</p><p>Finally, a suggestion. The hon Minister mentioned that potentially 260,000 SMEs may be beneficiaries under this amendment Bill once passed. May I please ask how would they be made aware of the reliefs under this amendment Bill so that they would be able to take advantage of these measures and keep their businesses alive.&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Minister Shanmugam.</p><h6>7.47 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: I thank the Members for speaking, for expressing their support for this Bill. Mr&nbsp;Pillai asked for clarification on what a sub-tenant gets under the rental waiver and he pointed out that Minister Lawrence Wong had said during COVID 1 that the Bill did not mandate for the rebate to flow to the sub-tenant.</p><p>Let me clarify that the Government\\'s intention has always been for the businesses that have actually been impacted by COVID-19 to benefit from this Government assistance. In some cases, the businesses may be sub-tenants. Minister Lawrence Wong, at that time, said, \"the Government strongly urges and encourages all master tenants to pass on the savings from the rebate to their sub-tenants and to share the burdens during this time of uncertainty and difficulty.\"</p><p>Minister Lawrence also explained that mandating further passing on of the rebates is difficult and complex because of the nature of the relationships that can arise. This is why, in my opening speech, I said this is actually quite a complex issue. But we studied it and we decided that the complexity can be solved and can be dealt with. And that is why, here we are mandating it.</p><p>What we decided to do was not only enhance the Government assistance but also put in place a framework that ensures that the assistance reaches the intended beneficiaries who are the actual company or business that is using the premises for business. Conceptually, how this works is – to answer Mr Pillai\\'s specific question&nbsp;– the Bill does not require cash to move from the Government to the property owner to the actual tenant or sub-tenant. What it does is put in place a framework of rental waivers mandated by law.&nbsp;</p><p>Given this mechanism, the concern that is raised on behalf of subtenants not getting the two months of rental waiver does not arise. We did it very carefully and specifically because if you require the money to be passed down, then there can be all sorts of arguments as to who it would pass down to, when was it passed down and so on. But by law, we are saying that rental is not payable. So, that is a very different proposition. Automatically, the subtenant does not have to pay his intermediate landlord, and the intermediate landlord does not have to pay the ultimate landlord. What each of those in between might lose is that mark-up.</p><p>So, the number of months of rental waiver a tenant will get does not depend on whether he is the tenant or sub-tenant. Everyone will get two months on this waiver mechanism. We will set that out very clearly in subsidiary legislation. IRAS will give a notification of cash grant to the owner of the premises because the owner of the premises has already received the money, everyone else does not have to pay rental. It is actually conceptually cleaner and neater.</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza asked about cases where an SME is a new company, which makes comparison to the previous year impossible or inaccurate. That is another complexity which we did think about.</p><p>First of all, the reason why the same period of time was taken for a year-on-year comparison – it is a fairly normal thing and we did it to avoid seasonal fluctuations in revenue. But where the tenants were not operational during the April to May 2019 period, we will choose another best appropriate period that will reflect whether the tenant\\'s performance has been impacted by COVID-19. That, again, will be in subsidiary legislation.&nbsp;For leases and licences that are even shorter, we will also work out the criteria.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza asked whether landlords who agreed to lower the rent will be able to set off the deduction against the rental waivers that they must provide. We want to be careful. The rental waivers by landlords will be calculated based on base rent payable by the tenant for the applicable period. Landlords will be allowed to set off any direct monetary assistance that they have already given against the rental waiver that they are required to provide. Or if they have already provided rental waiver, of course, they can take that into account.&nbsp;The types of assistance from landlords that will be considered direct monetary assistance under the Act will also be prescribed.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Jessica Tan asked about who the Assessors will be, the process for seeking assessment and the estimated timelines. A panel of Assessors, professionals, a fair number of legal and accounting professionals&nbsp;– they have already been appointed. More will be appointed to consider applications for assessments by landlords. With regard to timelines, we will make the process as simple as we can. We have made it very simple under COVID 1. The actual time taken for determinations to be made depends very much on the parties themselves and whether they adhere to the timelines. But, we will make them short and fast.</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza asked whether tenants will have access to the assessment mechanism either to challenge the landlord\\'s assertion of financial hardship or to ascertain whether they are eligible.</p><p>The criteria for landlords facing financial hardship as well as the tenants\\' eligibility will be objective. As for tenants, it will be IRAS which will make the assessment. If the landlord wants to challenge that, he can. If the tenant wants to challenge the landlord\\'s assertion of financial hardship, which will again be based on annual value of the property and what proportion of the rental income forms part of his total annual income, they will be allowed to challenge.</p><p>Mr Pillai asked how we arrived at the 3% cap on interest in the repayment schedule and when it starts accruing. The 3% interest is comparable to the median rate of secured bank loans in April 2020 and takes into consideration the landlords\\' cost of capital with property as security. We are aware that some landlords\\' cost of capital could be higher than 3% but this rate is intended to strike a balance between the needs of landlords who have their own financial obligations, and the tenants who do face significant challenges repaying their rental obligations under these fairly extraordinary circumstances.</p><p>Interest at that cap rate will apply from the time that the rent was originally due and payable but the rent and interest will only be payable in accordance to the repayment schedule. Interest at that cap rate will continue during the schedule repayment period until the arrears are paid off.&nbsp;To be clear as well, only arrears that accrue from 1 February 2020 until 19 October 2020 can be repaid under this repayment schedule.</p><p>Mr Murali Pillai referred to clause 7 on the relief for tenants who are unable to vacate their premises after the expiry of lease because of COVID-19. He asked about whether there is a corollary provision to protect the landlords who have a back-to-back arrangement, with a new tenant to deliver vacant possession by a certain date. This is why I said this legislation is not simple, though it looks simple at first glance. There are many related contracts that need to be thought through and we have provided for it. The landlord can serve a&nbsp;Notification for Relief&nbsp;on the new tenant. We imposed the rules that for those two months, there can be no work; and if there is a knock-on effect, that has got to be taken into account.</p><p>So, the landlord can tell the new tenant he cannot deliver vacant possession on time and the new tenant cannot terminate the lease on that ground. This will give the landlord and the new tenant time to work out a compromise. If they cannot agree, they can apply to an Assessor who will make a determination to reach a just and equitable outcome.</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the interaction between this relief and the rental waivers. There is non interaction. The rental waivers&nbsp;apply to the period during which the tenancy subsists. Holding over or double rent&nbsp;is only relevant when the tenancy has already ended and is not subsisting.</p><p>Mr Murali asked about whether leases are covered under Part 8. Part 8 may apply to all contracts that may be affected by an upstream delay in construction, except those which may be prescribed. Some contracts will be excluded.&nbsp;</p><p>We are looking&nbsp;at categories that should be excluded. For example, employment contracts should never be subject to these sorts of laws.&nbsp;But we also take the approach that only contracts which are actually written in, will be affected by the law as well and that will be gazetted.</p><p>Ms Jessica Tan asked&nbsp;if I could share how we have addressed the concerns of other affected stakeholders besides tenants and she mentioned that she is on the board of a REIT.&nbsp;We consulted landlords, bigger landlords as well as smaller landlords, we consulted REITs, we consulted business people and of course, we had substantial assistance from MTI, ESG, MOF, MND, MAS, bankers and so on.</p><p>So, in the process of formulating these measures, we consulted all of them. We held engagements with all of them, got their views, we actually took substantive feedback and amended, adjusted our proposals where we thought that we ought to do so. We could not take all the suggestions. You will see, as I have set out in the opening speech for the Second Reading, how we have come in to help the REITs, the landlords as well as the tenants, some by MinLaw, some by MAS talking to the banks, and some by IRAS and others, waiving some rules, amending them to help the REITs, for example.</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza mentioned&nbsp;that some distinction should be made&nbsp;between large corporate landlords,&nbsp;and smaller landlords who may themselves be facing financial hardship. We considered this carefully. We considered the factors that should be taken into account as to when landlords should considered to be unable to provide the additional rental waiver. We think that the two factors to be taken into account are the annual value of their properties and the proportion the rental forms of the landlord\\'s total income. This will allow us to distinguish between larger landlords&nbsp;and those who are heavily dependent on rental income for their livelihoods. The precise proportions, percentages will be set out in subsidiary legislation.</p><p>Mr Murali Pillai asked about the steps&nbsp;the Government is taking&nbsp;to ensure that those who are eligible for the rental reliefs are aware of this. I would say, I think businesses who need relief would be very aware of this legislation. In fact, they are waiting for it. We have had a fair bit of publicity. It was in Deputy Prime Minister\\'s Statement last week. MinLaw has put it out. I would be very surprised if anyone who qualifies is, at this point in time, not aware that they are going to get some benefits. We will put it out as much as we can. And IRAS will notify property owners who have eligible tenants and the property owners will have to notify their tenants and sub-tenants as well.</p><p>Ms Jessica Tan asked&nbsp;whether the rental relief measures&nbsp;would unnecessarily prolong&nbsp;the exit of unviable businesses, or benefit such businesses&nbsp;at the cost of landlords and taxpayers’ monies. This is a very serious and important, fundamental question which more than troubled me and was front and centre in my consideration in deciding whether or not to intervene. Because we need to help but it cannot become a crutch and it cannot be such that unviable businesses, therefore, continue because we are using taxpayers\\' money.</p><p>So, the starting principle, I would say is this. It is fairness. When&nbsp;we have imposed the circuit breaker rules for two months telling businesses not to operate, then I think we ought to give relief for that period. If we accept that COVID-19 was an exceptional event, then we ought to legislate for that as well in that whether it is viable or unviable, that is something that no one could have predicted.</p><p>Second, the risk is not so much looking at unviable businesses but looking at viable businesses. Even perfectly viable businesses, given the kind of hit that I have pointed out – 60% drop in turnover in April and probably as bad if not more for May – viable businesses will go down, their employees will go down, people will lose a lot of money. That is our focus. So, I would say it is not as if we are asking them to get down to a cruise liner and everyone is going to be saved. We are throwing them a lifeline of a few months rental waiver.</p><p>But the seas are still rough because Phase Two, it is not as if immediately, business is going to go back to normal. And then Phase Three, how many people are going to go out? How many people are going to spend money? What about the safe distancing measures? In a restaurant, how many can sit? So, business conditions are going to be tough. The seas are going to be rough. People would have to swim very hard. So, it will only be the very fit, the viable businesses that will survive that period even with the relief that we are giving. And none of us knows how long this will last.</p><p>In addition to the measures already taken under COVID 1, we are also considering measures to assess certain micro and small businesses which may need help in winding up or where appropriate, with debt restructuring. But that is a larger piece of work. It is still work-in-progress and we do it when we can do it. This answers Mr de Souza\\'s question on whether the Government has any plans to make further adjustments to the insolvency framework so that non-viable businesses that need to exit are able to do so smoothly.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I think I have covered all the questions. I thank again those who have contributed to this effort.

This means a well-balanced diet with sufficient intake of fluids, adequate physical activity, as well as having enough sleep and rest. Smokers should quit smoking as there is evidence linking tobacco smoke<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;with immune dysfunction. Similarly, alcohol consumption<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;should be avoided as it impairs the body\\'s ability to defend against infection.&nbsp;</p><p>For persons with chronic conditions such as hypertension or diabetes, particularly among our seniors, complying with medication and regular medical follow-up to ensure that their condition remains under control is important to keep up the body\\'s defences against infection. They should also go for the vaccinations recommended under the National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS), such as vaccinations against seasonal flu and pneumococcal diseases.</p><p>It is equally important to take care of one\\'s mental well-being<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;during this period. Taking up one or two hobbies such as music, reading a book or learning a new skill online, as well as using relaxation techniques, can help improve mental well-being.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Health Promotion Board (HPB) launched the \"Stay Well to Stay Strong\" campaign in February to provide Singaporeans with bite-sized videos and articles on practising good personal hygiene, healthy eating, physical activity, and mental well-being. With Singaporeans staying at home during the circuit breaker period, this has proven to be a valuable resource.&nbsp;In a span of three months from February till mid-May 2020, HPB\\'s resources on the Stay Well to Stay Strong resource hub have seen over 360,000 page views, with a 17-fold increase in monthly viewership since inception.&nbsp;There are over 162,000 views of the exercise videos, a 13-fold increase in monthly viewership since the campaign started.</p><p>For seniors, who may use social media less often, Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) and HPB have partnered Mediacorp to roll out the \"Learn Together with Me Season 2\" television series on Channel 8, as well as the \"Stay Well to Stay Strong\" series in Malay and Tamil on Suria and Vasantham respectively.&nbsp;Viewership for the Channel 8 series averaged 113,000 people aged 50 and above per episode; the other two series are currently on air.&nbsp;</p><p>Amidst the ongoing COVID-19 situation, we will continue to provide Singaporeans with various health initiatives and use alternative platforms to encourage Singaporeans to remain healthy.&nbsp;</p>',\n",

       "   'content': \"<p>23 <strong>Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Manpower (a) apart from periodic checks by the enforcement team, what more will be done to ensure that dormitory operators and landlords that provide lodging for foreign workers comply with rules for communal living; and (b) whether there will be tougher penalties for failure to comply such as the suspension of their operating licence and repossession of the rental flats or houses.</p><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;The Inter-Agency Taskforce is systematically testing to clear all dormitories of COVID-19 infections in the coming months. Before residents are allowed to resume work, all parties, including dormitory operators, employers and workers, are required to implement safe management and safe living measures to ensure migrant workers work and live in a safe environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Besides implementing safe management measures to prepare for the re-opening of workplaces, employers are also required to cooperate with the dormitory operators to facilitate the testing and clearing of their workers in the dormitories. These include confirming and updating the addresses of their workers in the Online Foreign Worker Address Service (OFWAS) and working with the dormitory operators stagger pick-up and drop-off time and provide dedicated transport for their workers to and from the workplaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Dormitory operators are required to implement safe living measures to minimise the risk of transmissions in the dormitories. These measures include tracking the entry and exit of residents and visitors in and out of the dormitories, limiting the inter-mixing of residents such as by staggering the use of common facilities, and strengthening the health surveillance of dormitory residents to identify residents who display symptoms of infection and isolate them quickly. In addition, we are working with the dormitory operators to progressively reduce the density of the existing dormitories by re-housing workers in the new temporary dormitories as they come online. This will allow the existing dormitories to provide more living space per resident to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases in the dormitories.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, workers also have an important role to play to ensure that rules for communal living are complied with.&nbsp;For example, they are responsible to monitor their health conditions daily, abide by the rules set up by the dormitory operators to minimise physical interactions with residents from other blocks, and promptly report to their dormitory operators and employers if they are feeling unwell.&nbsp;</p><p>To help employers and dormitory operators to understand and implement these measures effectively, MOM has provided relevant advisories and checklists and conducted briefings for the dormitory operators. To help foreign workers better understand their responsibilities, we have produced simple communications materials, such as infographics, in the workers’ key native languages for employers and dormitory operators to educate their workers and residents with. We have also tapped on mobile applications for foreign workers and foreign worker ambassadors from the Migrant Workers' Centre to reach out to the workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides engagement and outreach efforts, there will be penalties and consequences on each party if they do not do their part.&nbsp;Employers who fail to fulfil their responsibilities may be fined up to $10,000 or jailed up to 12 months, or both under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). They may also be debarred from employing foreign workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Dormitory operators who fail to put in place safe living measures at the dormitories can face a fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment term of up to 12 months, or both, per contravention. Operators licensed under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act (FEDA) may also have their operating licence revoked. Private property owners or landlords who have not complied with these measures will not be allowed to rent out their properties or flats to foreign workers.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure that workers comply with the safe living measures in the dormitories, dormitory operators are to set clear house rules and corresponding consequences for non-compliance. All cases of non-compliance have to be reported to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).&nbsp;Workers who repeatedly breach house rules pose a risk to others and may have their work passes revoked.&nbsp;</p>\",\n",

For imports of food, SFA imposes control measures that are calibrated based on the assessed food safety risks. Importers must be licensed, and apply for import permits for each consignment of food imported into Singapore, which facilitates food traceability and recalls if any food safety infringements are found. SFA also conducts regular food safety inspections and testing of the end product to ensure that food sold in Singapore complies with our food safety standards and requirements.</p><p>Such control measures are applied to the import and slaughter of turtle for food in Singapore. Approximately 95% of all the turtles, including wild-caught soft shell turtles, which are imported for food are slaughtered and processed into meat products at a SFA-licensed local slaughterhouse, with the remaining live turtles being distributed to the four wet market stallholders within one market for sale. Given that the food safety and disease transmission risk associated with the import, slaughter and sale of turtles is low, SFA does not test for diseases in imported turtles which are sold live. Nevertheless, as part of SFA’s inspection regime, SFA conducts random sampling and testing of turtle meat products, including those from the SFA-licensed slaughterhouse, for foodborne pathogens such as Shigella species and Vibrio cholerae (pronounced as vee-brio collar-rae).</p><p>Over the past five years, SFA has collected a total of 63 samples of turtle meat products and conducted 129 laboratory tests on these samples. All test results showed that the samples met SFA's food safety and hygiene requirements with no foodborne pathogens detected. Thus far, there have not been any foodborne outbreaks associated with the consumption of turtles.</p><p>In line with ongoing efforts to improve public health and environmental hygiene standards in Singapore, SFA will continue to be vigilant in its inspection regime and tighten requirements for food safety when necessary. However, the assurance of food safety is a joint responsibility across the industry, consumers and the Government. To prevent foodborne illnesses, food handlers and consumers should also observe good food safety and hygiene practices, such as the washing of hands with soap and water before and after handling any raw meat, and by thoroughly cooking the meat, which helps to kill any harmful bacteria.</p>\",\n",

This includes the confirmed COVID-19 cases who had visited Jurong Point.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ministry of Health (MOH) had used the check-in information from SafeEntry to confirm that COVID-19 cases had separately visited Jurong Point, and the specified outlets there. The information was used to formulate the list of public places that the cases had visited, and this has been made available to the public. Persons who had been at the locations during the specified times should monitor their health, and promptly seek medical care if they develop COVID-19 symptoms.&nbsp;</p><p>MOH will continue to leverage on different modes of technology to better support the efforts to prevent and control the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>',\n",

They also need to have mechanisms to monitor the quality of services provided and address any complaints.</p><p>The list of registered doctors and their credentials are available on the Singapore Medical Council's website. Psychologists may choose to register with their professional associations. The public can refer to the websites of private psychology associations, such as the Singapore Psychological Society, for listings of psychologists registered with them.</p><p>Both MOH and our healthcare institutions have systems in place to look into feedback or complaints against mental health practitioners. Patients may also lodge a complaint against doctors, including psychiatrists, with the Singapore Medical Council (SMC).</p><p>To uphold and improve standards, the SMC requires doctors, including psychiatrists, to undergo continuing medical education before their practicing certificates can be renewed.&nbsp;For other professionals such as psychologists, the Skills Framework for Social Service spells out the skills and competencies required for each job. The framework helps healthcare providers, training providers and the professionals to identify training needs and develop training programmes to upskill these professionals.</p><p>In addition, MOH and our healthcare institutions provide fellowships under the Healthcare Manpower Development Plan (HMDP) to send mental health professionals for specialised training. The HMDP scheme also facilitates visits by reputed overseas experts to Singapore to transfer knowledge and capability to local mental health professionals.</p>\",\n",

anticipation of the increase in claims since the start of the circuit breaker, MOM has strengthened the support to both employees and employers to resolve end-of-employment disputes. Where employees have filed wrongful dismissal claims, a good number have been due to the abrupt manner of termination rather than unfair terms – most employers have fulfilled their contractual obligations. With the complainants\\' agreement, we refer them to Workforce Singapore or e2i for employment facilitation.&nbsp;</p><p>We recognise that this is a period of unusual stress for employers and employees alike.&nbsp;Regardless of their business circumstances, all employers should carry out termination of employment contracts fairly, responsibly and sensitively. They must continue to adhere to employment laws, contractual terms, and the relevant tripartite advisories.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Employees are also encouraged to engage their employers to seek clarity on issues of concern.&nbsp;Where there are irresponsible practices by employers, MOM will investigate and take enforcement actions as necessary.</p>',\n",

In the initial month of implementation, a very small number of employers were unable to do so, due to technical or administrative issues. For example, their workers' bank account applications were still pending approval by the bank. In these cases, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) allowed the employers to continue to pay outstanding salaries in cash.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to its urgent necessity, this new requirement was introduced at very short notice. Nevertheless, the vast majority of employers have complied. MOM will continue to follow up and remind the remaining employers to make the switch if they have not already done so, especially now that circuit breaker measures have been lifted. MOM will in due course take enforcement action against non-compliance, as it would for other conditions under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.</p>\",\n",

       "  'content': '<p>1 <strong>Mr Leon Perera</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Defence (a) what is the projected total cost of producing, packing and distributing the NDP funpacks to each citizen and PR household for NDP 2020; and (b) whether the Government will consider creating an option for those who would like to donate the expense required for their funpack back to the state or to charities.</p><p>2 <strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Defence (a) whether essential and care items can be included in the NDP funpacks to enhance the relevance and usefulness of the funpacks during this challenging period; (b) what items in the NDP funpacks have already been produced for distribution; and (c) what happens to excess items not distributed or when households opt out of the funpacks.&nbsp;</p><p>3 <strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister how will Singapore\\'s National Day commemoration and celebrations differ at the national and local levels in view of the COVID-19 measures.</p><p><strong>\\tThe Minister for Defence (Dr Ng Eng Hen)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, the first three questions on the Order Paper are related to the National Day Parade. For Question No 3 put by Member of Parliament Ms Denise Phua, I will be answering on behalf of the Prime Minister. Can I seek your consent to take these questions together?</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Yes, please.</p><p><strong>\\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>: In Singapore\\'s relatively short history as a nation, the National Day Parade has always taken centre-stage as we celebrate each year of independence. Members in this House have attended these National Day Parades. And many of you have kindly told me after each parade that it was well done, the mood was lifted, there was a sense of togetherness as Singapore and Singaporeans.</p><p>So, I think, in turn, the National Day Parade has served our nation well&nbsp;– both as a rallying call for all Singaporeans to stay united but also a clear statement of our confidence and determination to succeed collectively, no matter the odds. Through thick and thin, good times or bad, it showed Singaporeans celebrating and standing firm as one people, regardless of race, language or religion. I am so used to the mask that I spoke with it; forgot to take it off! That is what COVID-19 has done to us.&nbsp;</p><p>How did it come about? Not all countries celebrate their national days the way that we have or put the national day parade as centre-stage.</p><p>There is a history to the National Day Parade. The first National Day Parade (NDP) in 1966 was held amid the most testing of times. But that inaugural NDP would set the example for the subsequent 54 years.</p><p>On the morning of 9 August 1966, 500,000 school children assembled in schools and sang the new national anthem, Majulah Singapura, Onward Singapore. That first NDP was held at the Padang with 21-gun salute as the President reviewed various contingents that we have become accustomed to the SAF, the Police, NTUC, uniformed youth organisations and so forth.</p><p>The military units then marched from the Padang into Chinatown, to waving crowds. Fireworks at that time, took place at the Padang and Fort Canning. It followed the Parade and it adorned the skies. At night, there was an illuminated sea dragon, 150 metres long, 12 metres tall, lit up by 12,500 bulbs. It may be prosaic to us today, but at that time, it was quite spectacular. It sailed across what is today\\'s Marina Bay.</p><p>By all accounts, it was an extraordinary event, especially for a nation that was barely a year old. Could Singapore afford it in 1966? Could the money have been put to better use? Remember that our fledgling nation had a host of unsolved problems&nbsp;– high unemployment, few could afford to own homes, high drop-out rates even at Primary 6, inadequate medical care. I am just naming a few.</p><p>Why did the first NDP proceed that way? Because the unity and collective confidence for the future that it engendered among Singaporeans was priceless. It showed to the rest of the world that despite great difficulties, ours was a country that would not be beaten down, ours was a people that will rise and overcome. Without that unity and confidence, Singapore could not have survived, let alone thrived against the challenges that our founding generation faced.&nbsp;</p><p>Member of this House will readily recognise that subsequent National Day Parades take reference from and pay homage to that seminal NDP of 1966&nbsp;– both in spirit and form.</p><p>At each National Day, as we did during the first, we are making a conscious act of the will. It is a willful event that we have said we will celebrate, whether individually or as one people, to celebrate each National Day with the same indomitable spirit, never mind the prevailing difficulties and never mind the differences among people.</p><p>As Singapore prospered over the years, that focus on survival, overcoming difficulties, even unity, may have inadvertently diminished.</p><p>We have had a good run. So, over the years, the NDP has now evolved into softer tones. It has become more individualistic, more of an affirmation of what Singapore is and what being Singaporean means to each citizen. So, you would remember the videos that we played in previous NDPs. They had resonance, Singaporeans liked them because they focused on individuals, differences among our people and yet the unity that we could form from it. That may be today\\'s zeitgeist but we should never forget that the first NDP and the origin of that spirit remains essential for our nationhood.</p><p>When the NDP Executive Committee (Exco) revealed some details for NDP 2020, some Singaporeans felt that these celebrations were wasteful and that the same resources ought to be spent elsewhere, especially in light of the impact that COVID-19 had on our economy and jobs. We have had four Budgets, and each time, we dig into our reserves, to make sure that we protect lives and protect livelihoods and jobs.</p><p>I appreciate that point of view and agree fully with them that we ought to be prudent. The final cost figures are not yet in, but at very least, this year\\'s NDP should be able to reduce the usual budget by a third, with savings from the cost of infrastructure that would have been built if we had held it in the usual way at the Padang or the Float @ Marina Bay.</p><p>I am all for prudence. I think Members of Parliament know me. But we should guard against the mood of despondency overcoming us or allow individual preferences to divide us. If we allow despair to prevail in our national psyche, particularly in this COVID-19 pandemic, then, I say that would be the greatest harm to the future of Singapore&nbsp;– much more devastating than the economic impact, the loss of jobs and businesses.</p><p>Indeed, through every troubled period of Singapore\\'s history – whether it was the British withdrawal in 1971, the recession of 1985, the Asian Financial Crisis in 1998, SARS in 2003, the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, the H1N1 epidemic in 2009&nbsp;– the drumbeat of the National Day Parade that Singaporeans marched to, neither faltered nor reduced in intensity. Even through those difficult years, Singaporeans chose to celebrate the National Day Parade as we have always done, and rallied together.&nbsp;Because of that hope and optimism, Singapore emerged stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>It has been five months since COVID-19 struck our nation. It is, by any account, the most severe disruption globally for at least a century. In fact, experts have to go very far back to find events that matched the equivalent magnitude of the impact. Events like World War I, the Great Depression of the 1920s and 1930s, World War II are cited.&nbsp;</p><p>For tiny Singapore alone, the infections will last many more months. But the impact of disrupted lives and livelihoods will last even longer.&nbsp;</p><p>If at this early stage, Singaporeans lose their mettle, their inner strength and equanimity, lose their resolve, weaken their resilience, sharpen their differences, then, we are already in trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not the Singapore that you and I know. This is not the Singapore spirit that has ensured our survival through many previous hardships. So, I say, despite the difficulties and indeed, because of the more challenging times that are ahead, we should celebrate this year\\'s NDP as we have done before and just as our founding generation did during the first NDP.&nbsp;That, for us, is the most important aspect for this year\\'s NDP.</p><p>The Exco for NDP 2020 has stayed true to its roots, but has adapted the format to reduce the risk of infection in the face of an imminent threat from COVID-19. Their concept, which Ms Denise Phua asked about, is a simple one. Not being able to hold the NDP at a central location with large crowds should not prevent Singaporeans from expressing their pride and love for Singapore and the call for unity.</p><p>NDP 2020 will be celebrated in the safety and comfort of every household in Singapore.&nbsp;We may be physically apart, but we want to join in spirit as one people with that same confidence and optimism and unity that the founding generation fostered despite harsher and grim circumstances.</p><p>Most elements will follow the traditions of past NDPs, but some items will be new. The morning segment will begin with the Prime Minister\\'s National Day message. To remind us of that founding Singapore spirit of that first NDP and to gear Singapore up to face difficulties ahead, it is only right that a parade be held at the Padang. The President will be the Reviewing Officer but for a much smaller scale parade comprising only SAF and Home Team contingents. This will be telecast live. SAF helicopters carrying the Singapore flag will fly over the Padang and also make their way across the housing estates through Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>When the Anthem is played at the Padang, flag-raising ceremonies around the island will take place concurrently, so that Singaporeans across the island, whether in their constituencies, camps, workplaces or elsewhere will be singing Majulah Singapura in unison.</p><p>In past NDPs that Members of this House have enjoyed, the SAF aircraft could fly only over the NDP site, whether at the Padang or the Float. With Changi Airport being one of the busiest in the world, that was all the air space and the air time that we could be allocated for NDP. We expect air travel to pick up in the months ahead and I know that MOT and CAAS are working very hard. But this year, let us turn this into an opportunity so that the SAF aircraft can fly in formation over the heartlands of Singapore, so that Singaporeans can watch it from their homes.</p><p>Mobile columns from the SAF and Home Team will also travel through various parts of the island. With them will be the frontline heroes and heroines who have shown exemplary sacrifice and courage in fighting this COVID-19 pandemic. I know that Singaporeans want to thank them personally. The NDP will be a good occasion from a safe distance for Singaporeans to cheer them on and show them their much deserved appreciation.</p><p>Instead of an NDP show with thousands of participants, there will be a boutique studio show at night, with performances by some local artistes and talents which will be broadcasted live. There will be interactive elements for Singaporeans to sing along, join in the Pledge during the show.&nbsp;</p><p>And as we do each year, there will be fireworks across a few sites in Singapore to cap the day\\'s and night\\'s events over the Singapore skyline, both in the Central Business District and the HDB heartlands. The fireworks will not be as long or spectacular as recent centralised NDPs, but I hope that it will lift the spirits of Singaporeans all across the island.&nbsp;</p><p>To facilitate Singaporeans joining in as one people and one nation, the NDP Exco provides what they call a \"Singapore Together Pack\". Mr Leon Perera and Miss Cheng Li Hui asked about this. The Exco had engaged various groups in designing this pack and has also taken in public feedback. Full details are still being worked out but let me share what I can.</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p><p>Singaporeans will find the bag for the pack useful as a reusable grocery bag; it is practical, foldable into a small pouch. The designs on the bag are by local artists with disabilities and some of our Primary 5 pupils – each design an expression of their feelings for their country and fellow citizens, and their hopes for the future.</p><p>As families will be at home, there is no need for single-use water bottles, neither plastic clappers nor packaging. These have been done away with, to reduce waste. There will be items that express our collective love and wishes for Singapore like the National flag – a full-sized cloth flag, a handheld one – as well as iron-on patches for your masks, a pledge card and face tattoos. Well-wishing corporations have asked to add to the pack items to express their gratitude for what Singapore has given them, by giving back to Singaporeans. The Exco has decided to include hand sanitisers, thermometers, face masks&nbsp;– I think Miss Cheng asked about this&nbsp;– and a snack and drink from a local F&amp;B company. Companies are also offering vouchers and we have decided to put them as an e-discount booklet. Mr Leon Perera asked about cost&nbsp;– the cost of each Singapore Together Pack will be around $2.40.</p><p>For every NDP, the Exco aims to be inclusive and they take in views and accommodate different interests where possible. I think this is good and forward-leaning. But let me just say this as a gentle caution. If every interest group pushes for its own agenda especially during the NDP, then our common ground to celebrate this national event shrinks. Because the Exco simply will never be able to satisfy every request adequately. What the Exco can do this year is to produce fewer Singapore Together Packs, taking into account those who have said that they do not need one. It will therefore produce packs for about 80% of households, which from prior experience should be adequate. All those who want them to celebrate our NDP together can collect them from the CCs.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic will define this generation of Singaporeans, just as the first NDP, those who attended the first NDP, the Merdeka Generation, were defined by the difficulties we had as a newly formed Singapore.</p><p>For this generation, our response will determine whether Singapore continues to thrive in the post COVID world. As with every crisis, people have a choice to make – to overcome or be overwhelmed.</p><p>As we did at the very first NDP, I urge all Members of this House and all Singaporeans to reaffirm our unity, to reaffirm our resilience, bonded by the same vision and optimism that Singapore will prevail and overcome the challenges that this COVID-19 pandemic has brought upon us.&nbsp;The months ahead will be trying and the difficulties ahead will test our resolve and cohesion. Despite all of this, Singaporeans can, and Singapore will, celebrate NDP 2020 with confidence and hope for a brighter future. [<em>Applause.</em>]</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Miss Cheng Li Hui.</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p><p><strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines)</strong>: I thank the Minister. I have four supplementary questions.&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that the total number of packs is for 80% of the households. How did the 80% come about? What was the redemption percentage for SG50 packs? Is 80% sufficient to cater to the anticipated demand? What happens to the unredeemed items?</p><p><strong>\\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;Let me thank Miss Cheng Li Hui for her questions. Our past experiences show that 80% will be enough. It is actually less than what we produce usually. We produce usually about 90% of households, sometimes 95%, but we have taken into account those who said they do not need one. I would like to believe that they feel that we are confident enough to celebrate and to join other Singaporeans without all these facilitative things&nbsp;– the flag, tattoos, the iron-on and your masks. We will leave them as they wish and so we will produce 80% which should be adequate.</p><p>The difficulty that the NDP Exco had is trying to shoot a moving target. They started planning this in March. So, when they presented to me the plans, they had a number of scenarios. One scenario was&nbsp;– this was before circuit breaker&nbsp;– the normal NDP, the usual, thousands upon thousands. An interim scenario is where you can have crowds of 50 or even 500. When I saw the plans, I said \"Let us dispense with Options A and B. Don\\'t waste time about it. Let us go to Option C. Let us just assume the worst that COVID-19 will bring\".</p><p>You can come out of the circuit breaker but in August, suppose something happens and we have to reimpose the circuit breaker. The mood will be down, Singaporeans will become despondent and that is the time when we say, \"Come together, have this National Parade even despite your fears, come out and celebrate\" – not come out literally, because you must stay at home; but come out in spirit and celebrate.</p><p>We have had two months off circuit breaker. The psychological effects are there. Some people actually like it; they find working from home more productive and they found a sweet spot. For others, there is actually fear, fear to come out, fear to join others. So, when I read notes that say why do we not be prudent, I completely agree with them. But I want to make sure that this is not despondency or fear.</p><p>If Members of Parliament, judging by the conditions, want to organise events near 9 August for your constituencies and you want us to facilitate with more bags, let me know, and if we can, we will produce more. I promise you this. Because for many heartlanders, these are physical touch points, commonalities, that when they wave the flag, it is the same flag, when they have tattoos, it is a physical token for them to latch on to. Never dismiss&nbsp;these symbols even though the cost is little.</p><p>So, I make this pledge to you. If you hand in your request and you know there are groups that will want it, whether it is various groups, please let MINDEF know and we will try to facilitate for more.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Leon Perera.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the hon Minister for his detailed explanation. I am sure we can all agree that it is important for the country to rally together to have a keynote that underlines our unity during this difficult time.</p><p>I just have two supplementary questions.</p><p>Firstly, when this funpack was announced, I did sense that many Singaporeans felt that at a time when public finances are stretched, and many citizens and micro businesses are facing a lot of difficulty and uncertainty, perhaps the resources to give a pack to every household could be diverted to those who are more in need at this particular time. The Minister has explained the plan with the funpack. But my question is, really, for something like a funpack to serve the purpose that it is intended for, consultation and buy-in from the public may be useful to understand whether most people would really want to have this and&nbsp;whether it would serve that purpose of banishing the despondency, raising the spirits, rallying and unifying everyone. So, learning from this experience, I wonder whether there could be a bigger role for consultation in future before a very large or elaborate logistical exercise, such as distributing packs for everyone, is undertaken. That would be my first question.</p><p>My second question is, I understand that REACH set up an online poll to solicit views of Singaporeans about the funpack. I was wondering how long this poll was up for and what the results of this poll showed, if that is available.</p><p><strong>\\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I am glad that the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) has agreed with me that this is an important time for us to rally together. I agree fully with him that we need to engage groups to see what for them represents a good way to celebrate our National Day Parade. But as I said in my primary answer, while the Exco needs to be open, forward-leaning, consultative, there is a balance. If every group with their individual preferences decide to use the National Day Parade to press for their differences, then I think the Exco has a very difficult task. Because it will never be able to satisfy all groups, it will never be able to be all things to all men. It will have to balance, as we do every year. In previous years, when they, even ourselves, who are conscious about climate change, want to reduce and they press for disposable water bottles, the Exco had to balance the need for elderly and children who need bottled water. The disposable water bottles are actually recyclable the Exco even looked at giving reusable water bottles, then putting water stands, whether it is at the Floating platform or the stadium or Padang, but they found it was undoable. So, they did the next best thing; instead of two small bottles, they gave one big bottle, which will reduce the amount of plastic, I presume.</p><p>It is always these choices to make between different interests. But the more important point is this: for this balance to be struck, how does each individual group want to press for its own interests?&nbsp;We have gone past race, religion and language, I hope&nbsp;– I am talking about the NDP show. But at every NDP show. I am still very careful that there must be proper representation, that even when we carry soft stories that we should represent all of Singapore. But if any interest group decides to say, \"My interests are not shown. What you represent as Singapore does not show my narrower sets of preferences or who I am.\"&nbsp;If they choose to assert those differences during National Day Parade, it is what it is, it is what it will become, but it will shrink our common space.</p><p>I do not know the details of the REACH survey. If Mr Perera wants to know that, he can put it to that Ministry and I am sure that Ministry will give him a full reply.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Ng.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Sir. Let me first thank the Minister for reducing the number of items in the funpack and reaching out to the green groups and listening as well. But could I ask two clarifications?</p><p>One, I do understand we are producing 80% of funpacks for the Singapore households. So, there is already a reduction but that is based, as Minister said, on estimations and based on past experience. Would it not be better to just ask Singaporeans whether they want to opt out of receiving the funpack, so that we can get a more accurate figure that will reduce the wastage?</p><p>The second clarification is what Member Cheng Li Hui asked previously, what will we be doing with the excess funpacks that are not collected?</p><p>Third, let me record my appreciation of thanks to the NDP Exco 2020. I worked with them for the last six months. As what NCMP Leon Perera has asked, we actually have been on the ground for the last six months getting feedback from the green groups and working together with them. In fact, this morning, we had another Zoom call with them to explain why we had a funpack, why we had certain items in there, and it was a very positive conversation that we had. I want to thank the NDP Exco for the forward-thinking, for really listening. It has been a privilege working with the Chairman, Brigadier-General Frederick Choo. In fact, I would suggest that the Minister make him NDP Exco Chairman in 2021 since he did not get to organise a full NDP this year, and he really has done an amazing job trying to find the middle ground and making very difficult decisions.</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p><p><strong>\\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;Let me thank Member Louis Ng for those kind comments. I had known that he had been involved and helped us for the last six months. But I chose not to cite his help in the reply to Mr Leon Perera because, it is better that Mr Ng himself said it. Otherwise, they will say, you know, whatever they will say. I thank Mr Ng for the suggestion that General Choo should be considered to be NDP 2021, in Hokkien, we say, \"Ho Gai Siao\" or a good recommendation. I am not sure if he would want it, but nonetheless, we will think about it.</p><p>Member Mr Ng\\'s point was more substantial. Why not have, before each NDP, a full public consultation as I think was the point that Mr Perera made. Just for practical purposes&nbsp;– Members of this House lead organisations, you are in businesses or in your organisations, you should know – there is a limit beyond which analysis becomes paralysis. You want to have feedback but&nbsp;you have to ultimately make a decision. Because why just a funpack? I cite this but I am not suggesting you make this an issue, but in terms of carbon production, my fighter planes probably produce more. While we \"rah rah\" to the zoom of fighter aircraft, jet fuel is being burnt up there.</p><p>Why focus just on the funpack? It could be many other things.</p><p>So, I think there is a limit to consultation. We will be forward-leaning, we will take in views, but there is a balance to be struck.</p><p>There is a time for every activity, a season for everything under the heavens. That is the ecclesiastical injunction.</p><p>What is this year a time for? Twenty-twenty. What is this year a time for? We have been divided like never before by a little organism, barely 0.125 microns. Relatives have been separated, grandparents from their grandchildren, couples, even spouses. For the healthcare workers, some were so fearful. They were not fearful about going to work but they were so fearful that they would pass on their infections if they got infected to their families, that they chose to stay away from their families, and the hospitals facilitated and found hotel rooms for them to stay alone.</p><p>Never a time have we been so physically divided. Never a time have we been so psychologically affected. And I say this to you not to frighten you, but the months ahead will be harder. This is not a time to show up our divisions. It does not mean we do not ask for feedback. But this is maybe a time, in gentle tones, to put aside some of our differences and come together.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Ng, you have some more clarifications?</p><p><strong>\\tMr Louis Ng Kok Kwang</strong>: Sorry, Sir, there really is just a remaining concern which is what will we do with the excess packs? I think I understand we might be donating them or giving them to some other groups. But many are asking what are we doing with the excess funpacks that are not collected.</p><p><strong>\\tDr Ng Eng Hen</strong>:&nbsp;I do not know that there will be excess packs. As I said, the mood may change. Let us all hope, maybe come August – given the wonderful job that my colleagues at the Multi-Ministry Task Force have done and Singaporeans taking necessary precautions – that actually come August, there will be a mood to come out of this and people want these packs because they want to join in the celebrations.</p><p>But if they are excess bags, 80% is less than what we have usually produced – there will be no shortage of avenues to distribute to, say, to certain homes or institutions, so they would not be wasted.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Gan Thiam Poh, next question.</p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>The following question stood in the name of <strong> Mr Gan Thiam Poh – </strong></p><p>4 To ask&nbsp;the Prime Minister (a) what is the total number of people who have downloaded the TraceTogether app; (b) what is the percentage of each gender for those who have downloaded the app; (c) what are the age groups; and (d) whether the Government will consider further incentives and measures to encourage more subscriptions including from those who are not technically savvy or inclined.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">5 <strong>Mr Vikram Nair</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister whether the download and activation of the TraceTogether app should be made mandatory for everyone in Singapore who possesses a mobile phone.</p><p><strong>\\tMiss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling (Fengshan)</strong>: Question No 4, please.</p><p><strong>\\tThe Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:&nbsp;Let me recap for Members what TraceTogether does. TraceTogether is basically a contact tracing app which uses your phone\\'s Bluetooth function to detect other phones nearby. It keeps a record of other TraceTogether users whom you happen to be in close contact with. It encrypts and stores this data on your own handphone. If, in the unlikely event, you turn out to be positive or diagnosed with COVID-19, this data is then uploaded to MOH, and the contact tracing teams in MOH use this to quickly identify, isolate patients, quarantine people who may be at risk or have been infected by you and can transmit the disease onwards.</p><p>Today, TraceTogether has been downloaded on a voluntary basis by 1.5 million users. The number of downloads, particularly given that it is voluntary, is encouraging. Unfortunately, the app does not appear to work as well on iOS or Apple devices as the iOS operating system suspends Bluetooth scanning when the app is running in the background. We have had repeated discussions both at the technical and policy level with Apple, but we have not yet been able to find a satisfactory solution.&nbsp;</p><p>Because TraceTogether does not work equally well across all smart phones, we have decided, therefore, at this point in time, not to mandate the compulsory use of TraceTogether. Instead, we are developing and will soon roll out a portable wearable device that will achieve the same objective as TraceTogether, but will not depend on possession of a smart phone. If this portable device works, we may then distribute it to everyone in Singapore. I believe this will be more inclusive and it will ensure that all of us will be protected.&nbsp;</p><p>Notwithstanding the limitations of coverage today, the data from TraceTogether has already been a very helpful additional tool for our contact tracers, especially when it is used in combination with other data sources. In some cases, it has improved the contact tracing process by automatically generating a preliminary list of close contacts for quarantine, and thereby it reduces the time taken to isolate these contacts and prevents them from spreading the disease more extensively.</p><p>I would like to emphasise that contact tracing remains a professional skill that is ultimately dependent on human judgement. Technology is an enabler; it is not a replacement for human judgement.</p><p>We thank those who have voluntarily downloaded the app to date and we urge more to download the app. We have also just upgraded the app to register the NRIC or FIN of the user, in addition to the user\\'s mobile number, so that we can more quickly establish the link between the identity of the confirmed cases and their close contacts.</p><p>To Mr Gan Thiam Poh\\'s question, we do not, at this point in time, have the breakdown of the downloads by gender or age, because such data is not currently collected by the app.</p><p>Yesterday, we issued a written response to Mr Murali Pillai who had asked about the confidentiality of the data, and I think it is worth me reiterating that again, that the data is stored only on your own phone in the first instance and accessed by MOH only if the individual tests positive for COVID-19. This data is only used for contact tracing. There are safeguards, including encryption, in place to protect this from malicious hackers. The data that is older than 25 days will be automatically deleted from your phone. If the close contact data is required for contact tracing,&nbsp;only a small group of authorised officers in MOH will have access to it. All the public sector data protection rules will also apply.&nbsp;</p><p>I need to emphasise again that quick and accurate contact tracing is a necessity. In fact, it has become all the more essential now that we are&nbsp;emerging from the circuit breaker. Because if you think about it, if everyone is at home, in fact, the need for contact tracing is minimal. But now that we have more people moving about, going to work, there will be more occasions when more people will have more close interactions with each other. Therefore, the collection and use of this data for contact tracing becomes even more essential. It will speed up the isolation of close contacts and reduce the risk of them spreading COVID-19 to their loved ones, family members, friends, colleagues and the community at large.</p><p>If we can reduce the incidence of clusters by better and faster contact tracing,&nbsp;then we can avoid having to re-introduce restrictive circuit breaker measures in the future. So, I hope all members of the public will work with us to achieve this.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Minister, can I take it that you are answering Question Nos 4 and 5?</p><p><strong>\\tDr Vivian Balakrishnan</strong>: Yes, with your consent, please.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p>',\n",

Many will face challenges in securing a job. The Institutes of Higher Learning or IHLs, together with various Government agencies, will provide whatever support we can to all graduates entering the workforce.&nbsp;</p><p>First, they will give graduates peace of mind during their job search, so MOE has suspended the repayment and interest for all study loans, for one year.</p><p>Second, the IHLs, namely the Autonomous Universities, Polytechnics and ITE – each have a significant network of companies and employers.&nbsp;They have been leveraging them to provide internships and Work-Study programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>Employers in general are facing difficulties due to COVID-19.&nbsp;But many are still prepared to hire and others who do not have job vacancies may be prepared to offer traineeships.&nbsp;IHLs are committed to trying their best to help our graduating students.&nbsp;They will contribute to the pool of about 100,000 opportunities under the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package that the National Jobs Council is overseeing and building up.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure that graduates have access to these jobs and opportunities, the IHL Career Centres will continue to provide career guidance and assistance, labour market information and organise career fairs. The Career Centres have stepped up the intensity of their efforts this year, including using online outreach and counselling tools to support graduates remotely.</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">For graduates who decide to delay their entry into the job market, the IHLs will support them to learn new skills and knowledge.&nbsp;IHLs will offer their graduates a few Continuing Education and Training (CET) modules free of charge and we are in the process of speaking to the IHLs, structuring all these modules into a continuous programme and with credentials at the end of it. In that way, graduates can take up this programme and delay their entry into the labour market while doing something very meaningful. Graduates can also enrol for further studies, including Advance Diplomas, Specialist Diplomas and graduate certification programmes.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Member also asked about internships.&nbsp;This has become a challenge as many internships have been disrupted due to COVID-19 and our circuit breaker measures to curb community spread. IHLs are working hard to identify alternatives so as to mitigate any impact on learning outcomes and graduation timings.&nbsp;If rescheduling the internship is not possible, IHLs will offer substitutes, such as working on industry-related projects and taking additional modules.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">COVID-19 will be a defining moment in our graduates’ lives, especially this batch of graduates. I urge our graduates to rise to the occasion and use this crisis to bring out the best of their generation. The Government will support them as closely as possible as they enter the next phase of their life’s journey.</p>',\n",

These practices are aligned with international standards laid out in the World Trade Organisation’s Agreement on Government Procurement.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">To address the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation and avoid further worsening of the public health situation, Government agencies had to obtain necessary goods and services as quickly as possible. While the default approach continues to be open sourcing via GeBIZ, the urgency meant that, in some cases, it was not practical to do so. For such instances, the procedures under Emergency Procurement allow Government agencies to directly contract with suppliers who have the necessary expertise and resources, instead of going through open sourcing. For example, as we needed to quickly source for and fit out premises to house at-risk persons, and also secure essential medical supplies, the agencies concerned established direct contracts with the suppliers outside GeBIZ who were best able to meet the requirements within the shortest timeframe possible. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Similar Emergency Procurement practices are also adopted in other jurisdictions. For example, in Australia, the European Union, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, government agencies may directly award a contract without the need for open competition under emergency situations, such as the COVID-19 crisis. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The proportion of COVID-19 related procurement by dollar value through GeBIZ as compared with other modes is not yet available, as such procurement is still on-going. Agencies will continue to use the most appropriate approach that best balances urgency of need and value-for-money in our efforts to protect public health and cater for the social and economic needs of Singaporeans and businesses. As the situation improves and there is less time urgency, a larger proportion of procurement will be carried out through the default process of open sourcing via GeBIZ. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Regardless of the procurement approach taken, Government agencies are required to ensure proper evaluation is done and necessary approvals are sought. In the event that direct contracting is used, Government agencies are still expected to assess that the quotes from the suppliers are reasonable, by comparing against prevailing market benchmarks and taking into account the time constraints and world-wide market situation. As with all procurements, transactions done during this period are subject to audit and compliance reviews by relevant authorities.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>\\tAssoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Second Minister for the reply. I think we all know, one advantage of having procurement in GeBIZ is that it is automatically transparent. And this is very important to parties in the market because they can get some information about what is available and what market prices might even be and so on. Will the Government be able to commit to publishing at least some summary information of what has been done and what has been issued for Government procurement relating to COVID-19 needs some time soon so that players in the market can update themselves and understand better how they can best respond and provide more competitive services and goods to the Government in this crisis?</p><p><strong>\\tMs Indranee Rajah</strong>: I thank the Member for his clarification. The truth of the matter is that if we all knew exactly when the virus decides to stop and when COVID-19 will stop, then we will be able to give a specific timeline on all the things we wish to do. But as we know, there is a possibility of second outbreaks, there is a possibility that it may not go the course we wish, in which event, Emergency Procurement will have to continue to take place.</p><p>So, the assurance that I can give is that best practices will be followed. As I have said earlier, we will make sure that the agencies still take proper evaluations and that they seek the necessary approvals, that they compare against the prevailing market benchmarks. And it is important to remember that all this is still subject to audit and compliance reviews. So, the framework for disclosure that we have in place will be complied with in due course. But if the question is whether we can do this very soon, the answer is I am afraid that the nature of this virus and the situation are such that it is not possible to say definitively one way or another.</p>',\n",

There is a range of debt instruments, including bonds and loans, with different structures, such as a mezzanine or preferred instrument, depending on the capital structure of the investee company.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">GIC and Temasek can and do provide loans, where the loans are provided in the investment context. However, they do not provide the same loans as banks or finance companies do, that is to say, they do not provide mortgage loans or working capital loans which banks provide.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The Government does not direct GIC’s and Temasek’s individual investment decisions, including decisions as to whether, when or in whom to invest in a loan. The President’s concurrence is not needed for investment decisions by GIC or Temasek. Instead, the Government holds the Boards of GIC and Temasek accountable for their overall performance. The Government ensures that GIC and Temasek have competent Boards, and such appointments are subject to the President’s concurrence.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Leon Perera.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tMr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I have just one supplementary question. This question is in the context of our sovereign wealth funds when they provide a rescue package, be it through loans or other instruments, to help to support the viability of some companies but not others. That sometimes creates a question among some members of the public and they ask how are these decisions made that certain companies obtain this kind of support and other companies do not.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">So, as a general principle, given that these are public funds, is there any way that the public can have some transparency about the thinking behind these probably quite significant decisions which may continue to happen as this crisis winds its way forward?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tMs Indranee Rajah</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. The way the Member has phrased the question, which is when they provide a rescue package to support viability, that is a wrong assumption. The parameters are, as I have laid out before, GIC and Temasek primarily invest, and they invest our Reserves, and their mandate is to act within their investment policies to get the returns that they can, that we are then able to use in various ways, as we have seen.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">So, they operate in the context of investment. They do not do business the way banks do, or other kinds of entities who may look to do rescuing just in the context of rescuing. As I have explained before, they do it in the investment context, and that is very well known. The framework within which they operate is well known. The commercial principles&nbsp;– and these are all commercial decisions – these are decisions that are taken by their professionals which are employed by GIC and Temasek. So, there is actually no difference with what they actually do, or loans made in the investment context.&nbsp;</p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>9 <strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for National Development (a) whether a tender was waived for the construction of all Government Quarantine Facilities (GQF), Community Recovery Facilities (CRF) and Community Care Facilities (CCF); (b) if so, whether this was due to time constraint or other reasons; (c) whether all such construction works were planned to be cost recovery or below cost engagements; (d) what price reasonableness test was applied; (e) whether attempts were made to explore whether other event and exhibition construction firms were able and keen to undertake the engagement; and (f) whether further requisitions of GQFs, CRFs and CCFs are necessary and whether the engagements will be done on a cost recovery or below cost basis.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><strong>\\tThe Minister for National Development (Mr Lawrence Wong)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government has responded swiftly to put in place a range of facilities to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. For Government Quarantine Facilities (GQFs) as well as dedicated facilities for Stay-Home Notice (SHN) requirements, we have made use of the capacity in existing Government chalets and hotels. In the case of hotels, we benchmarked the quotes provided by the hotel operators and negotiated for competitive rates, taking into account the prevailing market conditions.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">For Community Care Facilities (CCFs) and Community Recovery Facilities (CRFs), apart from using ready live-in accommodation like army camps and students’ residences, we also had to prepare new facilities in a very short time. We, therefore, moved quickly to fit out the Changi Exhibition Centre, the Singapore Expo, Big Box, the former ITE site at Ang Mo Kio, vacant factories and Tanjong Pagar terminal with beds and partitions and, in some cases, tentages, to quickly house the patients. And we now know from experience that I think we did all these not a moment too soon because we were able to get the capacity in place to look after quite a large number of infected patients without overwhelming our healthcare system.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The contracting of hotels and the construction of fit-out works were undertaken under Emergency Procurement, as my colleague Second Minister Indranee has highlighted earlier. This is provided for under the Government Procurement Rules, where urgent purchases have to be made in a pandemic outbreak and there is insufficient time to follow the normal procurement rules.&nbsp;The Emergency Procurement procedure allows for tenders to be waived and for contracts to be directly awarded to vendors with the necessary experience, expertise and resources to get the job done within a short period of time.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Notwithstanding the waiver of tender under such Emergency Procurement, all the agencies recognise the need for accountability in the use of public funds.&nbsp;All decisions for the setting up of CCFs and CRFs are, therefore, approved by the Multi Ministry Taskforce. The agencies will ensure that the quotes from the commercial partners are reasonable by comparing against market benchmarks, they will scrutinise the invoices and ensure that the works meet the standards required by the Government before processing the payments. In some cases, we have been able to get private sector companies to support the projects on a cost-recovery basis as part of their contributions to the community.</p><p>The Government will continue to partner different stakeholders, including private sector companies, to ensure an effective whole-of-society response to COVID-19, while maintaining a prudent and disciplined approach in the use of public funds.</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Pritam Singh.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: I thank the Minister for his reply and also the reply from Second Minister for Finance earlier on to Assoc Prof Walter Theseira\\'s question. They were quite helpful for members of the public to understand what emergency procurement is about, including the&nbsp;answer given by the Second Minister for Finance on audit, which explained that it is not as if audit has been done away with.</p><p>My question is on non-emergency procurement, going forward, with regard to perhaps quarantine facilities, stay-at-home facilities, whether the Task Force – as alluded to by the Second Minister for Finance – is considering more open tender processes, so Singaporean companies, other companies can participate, in light of the economic situation.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, as I had explained earlier, we had to rely on emergency procurement given the nature of the pandemic, given the time urgency that we were at and the need to activate our facilities very quickly.</p><p>Certainly, looking forward, if the situation were to stabilise and the conditions permit, agencies will consider going beyond emergency procurement to get more quotes or even to go through contracting via GeBIZ. And this would apply not just for the setting up of facilities, but for a whole range of contracting requirements that the Task Force require. But I think first and foremost, let us focus on the mission and the mission is not over, the fight is still on. So, we will do whatever is necessary to get the job done and to deal with the virus.</p><p><strong>\\t</strong></p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Walter Theseira.</p><p><strong>\\tAssoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Just to follow up on the questions which have been raised. I think the public understands completely that during emergency procurement, there is a need to get these goods and services delivered quickly by trusted suppliers. But given that the emergency procurement rules or situation may continue for quite some time, what can the Government do to try to broaden the number of vendors out there who could be eligible for providing goods and services under the emergency procurement rules?</p><p>For example, will it be possible to take a bit of time for the agencies to look at the landscape, the firms out there and to review the list of companies on this emergency procurement list? I think that would be very important to not only give us a good price and quality of goods and services, but also to assure enterprises that they will be able to help out and participate, and also, help their bottom line out a bit.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Lawrence Wong</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Member for the question which is related to what Mr Singh had asked earlier too. I would say that even under the scenario of emergency procurement today, agencies do not immediately go with one vendor. So, the various agencies that are looking at all sorts of contracting procurement requirements do already today engage a few vendors – whether it is for are M&amp;E works,&nbsp;whether it is for consultancy services and then they get the quotes. Even though it is not required under emergency procurement, they could have gone directly. They have already done that. They check the different quotations and then they go with a supplier. So, a range of different suppliers are already being used under today\\'s scenario and that situation will continue.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Walter, next question.&nbsp;</p>',\n",

These Nature Ways use multi-tiered planting of native trees, shrubs and ground cover to replicate the natural structures of forests. They make paths cooler and more comfortable for users, and facilitate the movement of birds and butterflies between green spaces. These measures have benefited the environment and biodiversity, and reduced the frequency of greenery maintenance needed.&nbsp;NParks will continue to identify more sites to be curated and managed as naturalistic landscapes, and implement more Nature Ways.</p><p>But even in such settings, there will still be a need for regular maintenance, especially for public health and safety reasons.&nbsp;For example, tall grass may conceal discarded litter, making dengue control operations more difficult.

Most sectors saw a fall in the formation of new business entities during this period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The cessation of business entities numbered around 3,800 in April, which was comparable to the average of 3,700 recorded over the same month in the past five years.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">For the rest of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a severe impact on many sectors of our economy. Outward-oriented sectors such as wholesale trade will be adversely affected by the global economic slowdown, while the air transport and tourism sectors will continue to be badly affected by travel restrictions. Sectors such as retail and food services will also be adversely impacted by reduced demand from tourists and local consumers. On the other hand, there are sectors which continue to grow, such as biomedical manufacturing and the information and communications sector.&nbsp;</p><p>Against this backdrop, MTI expects the formation of new business entities to remain subdued, while cessation numbers could see an uptick in the coming months.</p><p>Sir, it is not possible to avoid firm closure and retrenchments. These happened even before COVID-19, but with COVID-19, we must expect the situation to worsen and these numbers to go up. We will help every worker. Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam is chairing the National Jobs Council. The council aims to support close to 100,000 jobseekers through the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package. This includes initiatives to expand job opportunities in both the public and private sectors, provide a range of traineeships for jobseekers to gain industry-relevant experience and build professional networks, as well as increase training capacity to enable jobseekers to upgrade their skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is a very challenging task. There is no certainty that we will succeed in creating all the jobs and opportunities in adifficult economic environment. But we will do our best. We will rally together. We will bring on board all tripartite partners. We will support one another and spare no effort to achieve our goals. And we will overcome this crisis as one united Team Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\\tMr Saktiandi Supaat (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</strong>: I would like to thank Senior Minister of State Chee for the detailed answer. I just have one supplementary question. In relation to his answer, with MTI and EDB\\'s announcement that from January to April, there is an investment commitment of about $13 billion coming to Singapore. In terms of job creation, going forward, and also those investment commitments beyond April to end of 2020 and possibly early first half of 2021, can Senior Minister of State share a bit more about whether the trajectory of investment commitments will continue to be positive and in which sectors in particular, going forward?</p><p><strong>\\tMr Chee Hong Tat</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I thank Mr Saktiandi for his supplementary question. Minister Chan Chun Sing shared earlier this week that the investment commitments that EDB has managed to attract amounted to $13 billion and this will create thousands of jobs. We are heartened that investors continue to have confidence in Singapore and that is very important because we do need to create jobs&nbsp;from a range of different sources – public sector, but also private sector.</p><p>As to how well we can continue to attract investments, I think a key factor is how well we respond to this crisis as a country. If we can demonstrate resilience, fortitude, we can show unity, we are able to overcome this crisis together as one united Team Singapore, we are able to rally our tripartite partners to work closely together, I think we can inspire confidence and we can attract investments. We can demonstrate that Singapore has the capabilities and the resilience to overcome this crisis. That is very important – how we respond to this crisis together.</p><p>We continue to have to remain as an attractive business hub because it is not just about retaining our current capabilities and companies but also attracting new ones. I shared earlier in my main reply that there will be some sectors that will show a decline and some sectors will show growth. How we navigate in this new COVID-19 environment, how we are able to adapt, how quickly and how flexible we can be to adjust to attract new growth sectors – agri-tech, biomedical, e-commerce, financial sector, infocomm and technology – those are the areas which we have to work together to be able to grow the pie so that there is more to go around; better jobs, more jobs, more opportunities.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Next, question.

It will change the global economy and social norms in far more significant ways than past crises. We will likely remain in a COVID-19 environment for some time; and even when the pandemic recedes, life would not return to what it used to be.</p><p>Trade flows will be affected by the reconfiguration of supply chains. Some countries will respond by home-shoring certain production, while others will strengthen their inter-dependence with other economies and diversify their supply chains. How people travel will also change in ways more significant than after 9/11. Companies will need to transform their business models and operations. Manufacturers will have to redesign their \"just-in-time\" production to balance between achieving efficiency and resilience. The pace of digitalisation will accelerate and play a more fundamental role in the way we work, live and play.&nbsp;</p><p>As a small and open economy, Singapore’s response cannot be to turn inward. We need to find our new relevance to the world. Even as we cope with the immediate challenges, there will be new opportunities where we can seize, we can leverage on our strengths and we can ride on the key shifts brought about by the pandemic. While some of these developments are still playing out, and there is still some uncertainty in terms of how the new landscape will look like, there are a few areas our businesses and workers should start to re-position ourselves for.</p><p>First, changing consumption preferences, coupled with a rising middle class in Asia, will drive new demand. While the pandemic is still evolving, some changes, including those that started even before COVID-19, have become evident, such as a renewed emphasis on health and an increased focus on sustainability. If this continues, it will benefit industries such as healthcare, online retail and financial services – just to name a few. We will have the opportunity to enhance our value proposition in these areas to capture the growth in demand.&nbsp;</p><p>As Asia continues to grow, we must also work together with our neighbours to capture new opportunities. For example, in the agri-food industry, we are building up our local food production capabilities and also working with neighbouring countries such as Brunei, to grow this as an exportable sector that can strengthen food security and create good jobs for our peoples.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, global supply chains will be reconfigured as businesses seek to balance efficiency and resilience. This started before COVID-19, and we can expect the pace to accelerate. As companies shift their production lines, our manufacturing and logistics industries should position themselves to serve new demand and participate in new supply chains that are formed. We must continue to compete on our strengths such as trust, quality and connectivity. These have become even more important to investors and customers in the new environment. This is where our biomedical and precision engineering industries can play to our advantage by leveraging sophisticated technologies and the trust and quality that have been associated with Singapore. Our trusted brand name is an asset in this environment. If we can move fast to capture the opportunities created by these shifts, Singapore will be in a stronger position when recovery comes.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, the digital economy will take on greater salience than before and we must be prepared to seize the opportunities it brings. The pandemic has compelled businesses in all industries to turn to technology-enabled platforms for safe operations and business continuity. Besides shoring up a strong demand for digital solutions in the ICT sector, the quickened pace of technology adoption across industries has also transformed business models – especially for traditionally brick-and-mortar industries such as retail and food services – and it has enabled these businesses to access wider markets and consumer segments than before. For essential services such as healthcare, the rise of tele-medicine also provides an opportunity for the industry to redefine service quality and access markets beyond Singapore. Businesses will need to pivot towards the digital economy, and the Government will continue to extend strong support to help our enterprises to transform their business models and to train our workers in new skills to prepare them for this digital economy.</p><p>Sir, as a country, Singapore has time and again reinvented ourselves to be relevant to the world. We can recover from this crisis and we will grow again. Global competition will be intense. The road ahead will not be easy, but we will walk this journey together.</p><p>The key is to remain united and support one another to transform ourselves to seize new opportunities. We need to strengthen Singapore’s attractiveness as a hub for business and investments and remain open to global trade and talent to benefit from Asia’s growth. How well we recover will depend on our adaptability as a country, as businesses and also as individuals.</p><p>We start from solid foundations – a trusted brand name and rule of law, a cohesive and hardworking people, a strong tripartite partnership and excellent connectivity with the rest of the world. With these strong fundamentals, I am confident that Singapore will survive the crisis and we can emerge stronger.</p>',\n",

Singapore\\'s digital infrastructure remains adequate for our needs.</p><p>Given the growing reliance on telecom services, we are also looking into measures to strengthen the security and resilience of our networks, and minimise the risk of outages. Therefore, MCI and IMDA are working&nbsp;with our telecom operators to enhance our telecom infrastructure. This includes further increasing network buffers to keep pace with future demands and investing early in 5G networks.</p><p>Today, telecom operators, as part of network and service resilience requirements, must provide adequate redundancy, back-ups and diversity arrangements within their networks.&nbsp;But outages still occur even with robust measures in place. IMDA takes a very serious view of such network disruptions and is investigating the causes of the outages by StarHub, M1 and MyRepublic.&nbsp;Where necessary, IMDA will take enforcement action against any operator found liable for causing an outage or failing to restore services quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, we are studying alternative means to enhance back-ups in our networks so that consumers can continue to have connectivity during outages; as well as how telecom operators can enhance their capabilities to quickly identify and rectify the causes of disruption.&nbsp;These will be essential to the overall resilience of our digital infrastructure, and quality of service rendered to customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We aim to enhance our digital infrastructure in a sustainable manner that takes into consideration the energy and carbon footprint generated. IMDA is working with EDB to ensure that data centre investments in Singapore are energy efficient.&nbsp;The Government remains committed to our goals under the Paris Agreement.</p>',\n",

We have thus embarked on surveillance testing for staff of eldercare services to protect the seniors as they are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;</p><p>This surveillance testing in eldercare services will be conducted in phases.&nbsp;Given that seniors living in residential care homes are at higher risks, we prioritised and completed swab tests for about 10,500 staff of residential care homes in May 2020. Test results for staff were all negative save for one staff member from Ren Ci Nursing Home @ Ang Mo Kio, which we have announced earlier. In June 2020, we will progressively test staff of other eldercare services in operation, including those working at day care centres.&nbsp;These initial sweeps will help guide our approach for future testing.</p><p><strong>\\tMr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Joan Pereira.</p><p><strong>\\tMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>: I thank the Senior Minister of State.&nbsp;I have one supplementary question.

Indeed, the SACs may resume on-site activities gradually in Phase One. Before resuming on-site activities, SACs are required to undergo a readiness assessment and propose plans on infection prevention and control, and safe distancing measures. The Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) will also conduct spot checks to ensure that these measures are implemented. Prior to this, AIC has also conducted several webinars to inform providers of the necessary infection prevention and control measures and provided them with resource kits.</p><p>As at 5 June, 27 SACs have opened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>',\n",

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Ang Wei Neng.</p><h6>11.33 am</h6><p><strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng (Jurong)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Budget. In Mandarin, please.&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-Ang Wei Neng Fortitude 5June2020-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Sir, COVID-19 has led to economic contraction all around the world and Singapore is no exception. If we do not have sufficient reserves, the $33 billion Fortitude Budget would not be possible. We have to thank the previous Governments for saving for a rainy day, progressively setting aside budget surpluses for our reserves. Because of this, we are able to come up with four Budgets totaling $93 billion to assist Singaporeans, save companies, save jobs and save lives.</p><p>The circuit breaker has just ended and every company hopes to resume operations as soon as possible. Every employer is eager for his or her employees to resume work. Every Singaporean hopes to resume their lifestyles like before, visiting their parents, shopping, and going to the park. Currently, there is no cure nor vaccine for COVID-19, so we cannot do away with the preventive measures. So then how can we deal with the new normal in the post-circuit breaker period? Will COVID-19 continue to spread in the community? What is the level of risk?&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps, the testing of 39,000 pre-school staff can offer some clues. Currently, 14 pre-school staff have been diagnosed with COVID-19, which translates to an infection rate of 0.036%. Among the 14, 13 had contracted the virus previously and were no longer infectious at the point when they were confirmed as positive cases. In other words, these 13 pre-school staff were not aware that they had been infected prior to testing. Before they recovered, they could have passed the virus to others and spread it to the community while they were out and about. Fortunately, they had gone out less during the circuit breaker period and have minimised the risk of infecting others.&nbsp;</p><p>If we apply the testing and confirmed case numbers of the pre-school staff to the 2.4 million working citizens and Permanent Residents in Singapore, then the infection rate of 0.03% would mean that there may be 861 local residents who have been infected but are unaware about it. More importantly, among the 39,000 pre-school staff, one individual was infected recently. From the infection of pre-school staff, it is not difficult to understand why zero community infection could not be maintained in the past few weeks.</p><p>Moving forward, as we embark on the first phase of the post-circuit period, more people will leave home to work and the risk of community infection will definitely increase. I know that many SMEs would like to resume operations but I would urge everyone to be more patient.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, our community infection rate has been relatively low. The death rate has also remained low. There are only five patients in ICU currently. Experts say that in the next one and a half years, it is not possible to eradicate COVID-19 totally from the community. Therefore, Singaporeans must remain vigilant, wash their hands frequently, wear a mask and maintain the one metre safe distance. Safe management measures at workplaces will become the new normal. If people are infected, they should be quarantined immediately, and proactive contact tracing must be conducted.&nbsp;</p><p>If people are able to accept this new normal and understand that COVID-19 will not disappear in a few months like SARS, I hope MTF will allow all industries to resume operations as soon as possible. This will boost consumption and save jobs. Otherwise, no matter how much support and grants are given, so long as companies cannot operate, there will still be retrenchments and insolvencies.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that the Government will be flexible in this aspect. I am the advisor of the Renovation Contractors’ Associations. The Chairman of the Association, its key members and myself have held meetings with BCA several times to pave the way for resuming work. Many families’ renovation projects had to stop because of the circuit breaker measures, and they cannot wait for the project to start again.&nbsp;However, the requirements for resumption of renovation projects have been very stringent. Through several rounds of consultations, BCA has simplified the procedures and allowed several thousand renovation projects to resume on 2 June. I would like to thank BCA for their help.</p><p>COVID-19 has disrupted industries and sped up the pace of digital transformation. However, at markets and hawker centres, most stallholders accept cash only. After NETs was set up in 1985, Singapore soon became the leader for e-payments in Asia. However, after so many years, we have lagged behind other Asian countries in terms of e-payments. Therefore, I am happy to see the establishment of the Digital Transformation Office and that every hawker will be given a $300 monthly bonus for the next five years to encourage them to adopt cashless payments. There are also plans to recruit 1,000 digital ambassadors to help the elderly Singaporeans learn digital skills.</p><p>Last year, when organising the River Hongbao activities, we worked with NETS to encourage the food stallholders to adopt cashless payments. However, the results were lacklustre. When I visited markets, hawker centres and coffeeshops, I also received feedback on cashless payments from stallholders. Some were positive; some were negative. Therefore, I would like to make a few suggestions so that we can improve the e-payment adoption rate and the efficiency of digital ambassadors.</p><p>Some stallholders are worried about the cash flow problem, so they hope that they will be able to get the e-payments by customers several hours after the payments were made.&nbsp;</p><p>Stallholders currently pay cash to suppliers for materials. If this segment of the supply chain can be digitised, more stallholders may be encouraged to adopt e-payment.&nbsp;</p><p>There are currently 19 e-payment platforms in Singapore. I understand that the intention of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is to allow different e-payment platforms to thrive. However, this may lead to confusion and it may distract customers. I suggest that IMDA focus on one or two platforms such as PayNow and NETS. This will make e-payment easier for Singaporeans, especially the elderly.</p><p>According to a report by Lianhe Zaobao, most of the digital ambassadors recruited will be graduates from Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL). These fresh graduates are familiar with technology, but they may not empathise with the fear and resistance of stallholders against e-payments. I hope that the Government will focus more on recruiting Singaporeans who may have initial reservations about technology but have learnt to use e-payment eventually. Then, they can effectively encourage stallholders to embark on digital transformation.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chinese say that food is the most important of all things. Only when everyone can use e-payment to buy food, can we say that our digital transformation is truly taking shape. I hope that from now onwards, stallholders who used to count cash will use the QR code as the norm.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, resilience is forged through crisis.&nbsp;With this fourth Budget, the Government has already pumped in $93 billion to help Singaporeans and the economy.&nbsp;While COVID-19 has created havoc, it is clear that COVID-19 has also brought out the best in us, not just in putting the community above self-interest and abiding by the circuit breaker rules, but also in how some of us are extending a helping hand to others. There are countless examples, like those who have volunteered to help out in the frontline at the migrant worker dormitories, or those who have signed up with different charities via Giving.sg&nbsp;to donate money, essential items or volunteer their time.</p><p>There are also many inspiring stories in Jurong West, helping others during this difficult time.</p><p>One of our residents, Joyce Yu, did not throw up her hands in defeat when her parent\\'s nasi lemak hawker stall suffered from a plunge in business due to COVID-19 and the circuit breaker measures. Instead, she managed to raise funds from her friends so that her parents could provide nasi lemak as free breakfast for needy families in Jurong.</p><p>As her parents also had hawker friends who were in the same situation, she slowly expanded the scheme. Today, she has raised about $20,000, not just from her friends, but also through the Giving.sg website and the Loving Hearts Multi-Service Centre in Jurong.&nbsp;These funds help to pay about nine workers, including her parents, to provide about 150 free breakfasts to families in Jurong every day. Grassroots volunteers also chipped in by distributing the food free of charge.</p><p>Joyce has a full-time job with YMCA but she is happy to liaise with the hawkers and raise funds. She says she wanted to come up with a scheme which is a win-win solution to support local businesses, hawkers like her mother\\'s, while feeding vulnerable people.</p><p>Joyce is not alone. There are many similar stories like hers.&nbsp;We want to encourage more.&nbsp;We want to collect all these good deeds and inspire more to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This year National Day will not have the glitter and pageantry of the huge parades like what we have had over the last 54 years. This year\\'s National Day is our nation\\'s 55th birthday. We want to celebrate the unsung heroes fighting the COVID-19, the everyday resilience and the sense of community on the ground which has given us a silver lining during these challenging times.</p><p>Like our pioneers in the late 1960s and 1970s that have built our nation from scratch, we will be the pioneers in winning the war over COVID-19.&nbsp;We are using the reserve build up by our Pioneers to fight the current crisis.&nbsp;But, we are also want to be the pioneers that transform our economy digitally so that our children can reap the fruits of our new digital economy.&nbsp;In the fight against COVID-19, I hope all Singaporeans can proudly say “count on me”.</p><h6>11.46 am</h6><p><strong>Prof Lim Sun Sun (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his unveiling of the Fortitude budget. This budget is aptly-named because it seeks to fortify support programmes that are urgently needed across all levels of an economy beleaguered by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>I wish to focus my speech on the welcome support offered via the new SGUnited Mid-Career Traineeship Programme that aims to provide 4,000 traineeships for mid-career unemployed locals. This programme is especially timely as our country goes through rapid digitalisation, now fiercely accelerated by COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As mature workers, mid-career jobseekers are understandably anxious about the drastic confluence of digital disruptions, outmoded skills and ageism working against them. Compared to fresh graduates, their needs are more complex as many would also be from the sandwich class, juggling lifestage obligations of parenting and eldercare and so their salary expectations are naturally higher. Even though they have an established track record, they will find it harder to pivot, having honed their skills in industries that may be on the decline. And yet, with their maturity and life experience, they still have much to offer our society and ample potential to grow.</p><p>As the relevant Ministries and agencies work together to operationalise the finer details of this programme, I would like to share insights from industry leaders so that the programme can bring maximum benefit to the trainees and companies participating in this scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Principally, industry leaders recommend that expectations of both sides must be carefully managed to heighten mutual understanding and satisfaction with the programme. The participating companies’ should be supported with instructive guidelines on how best to integrate and upskill their trainees. MOM should provide some flexibility and support for employers across a group of complementary companies to offer cross-training opportunities.</p><p>For example, career portal Mums@Work has successfully experimented with developing consortia of companies in related industries collaborating to collectively train returning talents so that they can be exposed to a broader swathe of skills. Trainees can thus explore multiple career paths and better identify their transferable strengths in the process.</p><p>With such innovative arrangements, companies can offer their trainees a wider range of skills upgrading opportunities and support each other without incurring prohibitive overheads.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies should also be upfront with their trainees about the potential for longer term job prospects or the lack thereof, and share in advance the kinds of post traineeship support they can provide. They should also be more explicit about articulating their criteria for retention if they can afford to increase their headcount. That way, the trainees will not feel like they have been led down the garden path.</p><p>Besides such substantive issues, the approach that participating companies adopt in hosting these trainees can also make or break a traineeship. There are horror stories of job attachment schemes where mature trainees must sign in daily for a visitor’s pass to enter the company, or who are supervised by very junior colleagues with no managerial experience to speak of. These socio-emotional aspects of mid-career training must be effectively addressed to ensure win-win outcomes for everyone. Above all, the scheme must accord trainees with a sense of purpose and dignity.&nbsp;</p><p>On their part, trainees must also pull their weight and not regard the traineeship as a paid sabbatical. They too should be provided with pointers on how they can make the most of their stints and the appropriate mind sets they should adopt to fully benefit from the programme.&nbsp;</p><p>Fundamentally, the traineeships should offer a combination of substantive skills and career planning competencies that will empower these mid-career jobseekers for their next career move.</p><p>In this regard, the experience of the Singapore Computer Society’s Career Compass programme offers some valuable lessons. Besides providing training in technical skills relating to growth areas such as AI, cyber security and enterprise architecture, the programme also offers career preparatory training in areas such as professional branding, resume building and interview skills.</p><p>With a careful and concerted design of SGUnited Mid-Career Traineeship offerings and actionable guidelines for participating companies and trainees, I am hopeful that this scheme can help to prepare mid-career workers for the next phase of their careers. On that optimistic note, I support the Fortitude Budget.</p><h6>11.51 am</h6><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the $33 billion Fortitude Budget. This is an unprecedented Budget but it is necessary as this is one of the worst crises to hit us in our nation’s history.</p><p>Many of my residents in Henderson-Dawson have shared with me how they and their companies have been directly assisted by the various assistance schemes and programmes announced as parts of the Unity, Resilience and Solidarity Budgets. Many are also acutely aware that we are drawing on our reserves and have expressed their worries about drawing down on our nation’s savings, especially since we do not know how long this crisis will last.&nbsp;It is a delicate balance between the needs of our present and our future, and the Government has had to make some very tough decisions for the good of everyone in Singapore under these trying circumstances.</p><p>The central focus of the Fortitude Budget is jobs.</p><p>I am glad to see that the various age groups of our society will continue to receive assistance.&nbsp;From young graduates to middle aged employees, and to older workers, all will receive help with jobseeking, job-matching and training.&nbsp;We are especially concerned for the sandwiched workers – those who are supporting both children and elderly parents.&nbsp;I urge them to take up the various assistance schemes applicable to them and come forward to request for help if they are unsure of what to do.</p><p>It is important that even as we focus on taking care of our immediate needs, we must also be mindful of our external environment and keep an eye on what is ahead of us.</p><p>In early May, Deputy Prime Minister Heng had said that, I quote, “there should be no lost generation in Singapore… we are sailing into uncharted waters, surveying the new landscape, exploring new growth and opportunities, preparing to seize them when the storm passes...\"</p><p>I would like to speak a little about the young adults who will be joining or who had just joined our workforce. This is a world that seems so familiar and yet so different from the one they had grown up expecting to enter.</p><p>This generation had grown up hearing from their elders about how fortunate they have been, growing up enjoying the many benefits of a prosperous nation as compared to Singapore’s founding years.&nbsp;And now suddenly, within the space of a few months, the world has changed.&nbsp;It is so much harder for them to get jobs. The malls are closed. They cannot hang out with friends. Suddenly, we also have an entire generation of Romeos and Juliets, forbidden from meeting each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As this group is young, we may not be as worried as we may be for older Singaporeans. They will also receive support under the Fortitude Budget’s SGUnited Traineeship which aims to provide 21,000 traineeships for local first-time jobseekers, and there is additional support from the Hiring Incentive scheme which has been expanded to cover workers of all ages.&nbsp;Certainly, some of the 40,000 jobs to be created in the public and private sectors by the SGUnited Jobs initiative will be offered to this young cohort too.</p><p>However, being young and with less experience, they may face obstacles searching for jobs in a very tight labour market.&nbsp;</p><p>I am glad to note that MOM will take active steps to assist those who need advice and career counselling in applying for jobs and being matched with training programmes and jobs. However, for some young people, the jobs they had been preparing for may have all but disappeared and some are even at a loss about whether they should consider switching industries.Thus, the Government, together with industry and the Institutes of Higher Learning, should work&nbsp;even more closely together to help them navigate the job market in this challenging environment.</p><p>We must be mindful of the impact of this crisis on them for years to come and have the appropriate strategy to help them to ensure that they will not become a lost or traumatised generation.&nbsp;For a number of them, they are entering the adult world with “empty hands”, as their parents and family members may also face job losses or business difficulties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My concern is that as our economy recovers in the future, this cohort’s experience and their subsequent actions would have consequences for us as a nation. Even with the use of technology and solemnisations via video link, relationships and marriages may be delayed. They may delay having children, have fewer children or none at all.&nbsp;In delaying procreation, the chances of having healthy children are reduced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our family units form the foundation of our society. Matching up young single Singaporeans may hardly be a priority now but I hope the Government will be mindful of this issue as it has wide ranging implications, including our economy’s competitiveness and national security.&nbsp;</p><p>As for those who have decided to take the leap, we can do more to support these new young families. There are attractive grants in place for HDB flat purchases. Nonetheless, I would like to ask the government to help them with the repayment of their HDB loans.&nbsp;Please consider accepting even lower deposits and smaller repayments monthly.&nbsp;This need not be permanent.&nbsp;The crisis will not last forever, in three to five years, the economy will pick up and the couples can make up for the difference later.&nbsp;This will also be timely as they progress in their careers, earn more and become able to afford higher mortgage payments. I also wish to appeal for higher subsidies for pregnancy check-ups, deliveries and childhood vaccinations to make procreation even more affordable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Would MND also consider building bigger HDB flats in the future?&nbsp;Not only do bigger units allow families to continue living together and help to look after each other, they will also take into account that more citizens will be working and studying online from home. This will be become a permanent trend.&nbsp;More and more people will need a home office and increasingly, home-based learning will be part of all students’ schedule, whether during emergencies, or, regularly utilised to ensure that the system is working and that the students and teachers stay familiar with the online learning platforms.&nbsp;Such a change in working and learning patterns means that there is a need and demand for a bit more space, with internal dividers, for all members of a family to do their jobs and studying sustainably, without disturbing one another.</p><p>Let us support our young adults who are standing at the entrance of independence and parenthood.&nbsp;Encourage them to proceed to the next lap with those they love. The pandemic will pass. And throughout the way, we will help everyone to tide through these tough times together.</p><h6>11.59 am</h6><p><strong>Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Fortitude Budget sets aside $33 billion more to help firms and households, and to save jobs. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it a health and economic crisis that has Singapore facing the worst recession since Independence. Our Government’s response has had no precedent – unstinting and rapid support to the tune of $93 billion thus far, resulting in the largest overall Budget deficit in our nation’s history.</p><p>Including this Budget, the Government will need to draw up to $52 billion dollars from its reserves. It is indeed a blessing that Singapore should possess such a reservoir of financial resources to see us through this crisis. Many countries around the world will be burdened, burdened in the years to come with record levels of debt from the huge fiscal stimulus programmes they have had to put in place to deal with the impact from COVID-19. So, we are more fortunate.</p><p>But, Sir, there is no question that Singapore was absolutely right to tap the reserves decisively in order to help businesses, tide Singaporeans through this crisis and mitigate permanent damage to our economy. However, we should also be concerned about fiscal sustainability, especially when the outlook remains uncertain and downside risks remain significant. There is a lot of talk about what would the shape of the recovery be, but many believe that recovery will&nbsp;be slow and long-drawn; it may take years before we return to pre-COVID-19 conditions.</p><p>Against this backdrop, I wonder how this massive draw on our reserves will be treated. What are the obligations to pay back? To do so, would be a huge task as the amount is more than 10 times our previous draw, when we used it to deal with the Global Financial Crisis. How will this influence our tax policy in the coming years, as we work to restore public finances in an equitable manner? Will we need to dig deeper, to implement more progressive income taxes and greater wealth taxes? Will tax systems need to evolve in tandem with the rising digital economy and capture revenue earned from online transactions?</p><p>With the economic outlook remaining highly uncertain and with risks predominantly skewed to the downside, we should be very cautious when we do further draws on our reserves. I support the call to set aside a sum of $13 billion in Contingencies Funds, but, I must urge the Government to do so with utmost prudence.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted businesses and workers unevenly.&nbsp;I urge Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat to adopt in the next phase, if he has to do something, a more targeted approach in future support schemes.</p><p>For example, the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), payouts should only go to firms adversely impacted by the crisis. We should learn from Australia. In Australia, for their scheme, eligibility for wage support only kicks in if business turnover drops by 30% due to the pandemic; for larger companies with turnovers of over A$1 billion, their drop in turnover must be at least 50% before they can be eligible.&nbsp;It should not be right for firms to profit from the Government\\'s support scheme during this crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>For some companies, whose bottom lines have been boosted because of JSS, they should be offered the opportunity to \"pay it forward\", in support of others who are less fortunate, perhaps through a \"Solidarity Levy\" of some sort.</p><p>Sir, this crisis will increase income inequality. Recent research at Oxford found that those earning under GBP20,000 are less able to perform work remotely, earn a smaller proportion of their previous salary and are twice as likely to lose their jobs compared to those earning GBP40,000 or more.&nbsp;We can draw similar parallels here in Singapore. It has been far easier for those employed by large companies and highly skilled sectors to work remotely, than for those employed by SMEs or in the retail and F&amp;B sectors, as well as those engaged in low-paying contract work. So, we must find ways to buffer the hardship faced by these families. We should be prepared to support them with some basic level of income beyond the current provision of COVID-19 Support Grant, should their unemployment persist.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support Deputy Prime Minister\\'s call to think urgently about how Singapore can emerge stronger. We must prepare our workforce immediately for a post COVID-19 environment, to adapt quickly to structural changes in the economy, changed consumer habits and new ways in which countries will compete and co-operate with one another.</p><p>I also applaud Deputy Prime Minister for his bold move to launch the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, creating 100,000 opportunities in jobs, traineeships and skills training to mitigate risks associated with unemployment.</p><p>The Deputy Prime Minister has promised to \"protect every worker even if we cannot protect every job\". But this commitment to protect every worker should not create a false sense of security or complacency. Instead, it should encourage individuals to leverage this safety net in order to position themselves for the longer term, by critically assessing their operating environment, learn new skills, try new jobs and seize on the many schemes available to ensure that they remain relevant.</p><p>The formation of National Jobs Council as well as the Emerging Stronger Task Force are great initiatives for developing strategies to pivot ourselves to the new jobs landscape.&nbsp;I am also impressed with the speed by which job initiatives are being rolled out – these include the 11,000 traineeships by 1,000 organisations who have come on board so far, so quite impressive.</p><p>Our ability to coordinate, navigate and implement Whole-of-Government initiatives is truly the competitive advantage that Singapore must play to.</p><p>Amidst the doom and gloom, it is reassuring to learn that Singapore has secured $13 billion of investment commitments in just four months of this year – amongst the highest in recent years.&nbsp;This is a testament of the confidence that investors and businesses have in Singapore and the hard work that MTI continues to put into selling \"Singapore Inc\". Indeed, as social, political and geopolitical instability continue to play out elsewhere in the world, Singapore is well positioned as the much-sought-after safe harbor for business, talent, intellectual property and investments.</p><p>Sir, COVID-19 has changed many long-held beliefs and opened up new perspectives. I think many of us&nbsp;believed that Singaporeans were not attracted to care-giving jobs, so we were always going to be heavily reliant on foreign nurses and care-giving professionals. However, our response to the pandemic shone a light on the meaningful work that healthcare professionals do and held them up as the heroes that they have always been.&nbsp;School children wrote \"thank you\" notes, Prime Ministers called them out and people clapped from their balconies the world over, out of gratitude for their sacrifice. The large number of temporary positions made available to deal with COVID-19 has also provided a window of opportunity for people to try their hand at this work. I must say I am so encouraged to witnessed an emerging&nbsp;interest amongst young people in joining the healthcare industry and shifting attitudes towards the care-giving profession. Sir, we should seize upon this window of opportunity to accelerate this trend and attract more Singaporeans to join the healthcare profession that offers great long-term career prospects.</p><p>Lastly, COVID-19 has taught us that large-scale remote working is indeed possible. With the help of technology, employers are quickly equipping their workers with the tools they need to work from home. I myself have been surprised at how much more productive I have been, working away from the office. Facebook has begun planning for workers to work permanently from home, whilst Google has extended its work-from-home policy for the remainder of 2020.</p><p>With working remotely accepted as the new normal, we should leverage this opportunity to&nbsp;supercharge Singapore\\'s growth in the Infocomm Technology sector (ICT). Many tech firms complain that they have not been able to scale their business in Singapore given our limited talent pool.&nbsp;With the accelerated plan to build a strong pipeline of digital and technology skills locally as announced by Minister Iswaran yesterday, companies can also supplement the local talent pool with global expertise to scale the business by&nbsp;extending working from home beyond our national borders. So, extend that, work from home, but beyond the national borders. Singapore companies can tap AI, data analytics, cybersecurity resources from around the world to support Singapore\\'s development work without these tech professionals having to relocate to Singapore.&nbsp;Our innovations in organising work and how work should be done, can fuel our ambition to be Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise.</p><p>I urge the Emerging Stronger Task Force Committee to scrutinise these and other trends emerging from this COVID-19 pandemic, so that it may inform their recommendations to prepare Singaporeans for a post COVID era.&nbsp;Winston Churchill is credited with first saying, \"Never let a good crisis go to waste\". Singapore has certainly invested a good deal in this crisis, it is time to learn the lessons, turn challenges into opportunities and reap the rewards for a stronger, brighter tomorrow. I support the Budget.</p><h6>12.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, I join many Singaporeans in thanking the Government for the Unity, Resilience, Solidarity and Fortitude Budgets. The support measures introduced will help ensure that we can all get through this pandemic and most importantly, get through it together.</p><p>I am thankful that the concerns of those on unpaid leave or reduced salaries have been addressed through expanding the COVID-19 Support Grant to help this group of Singaporeans.&nbsp;I am thankful we are proposing to help the SMEs with further rental waivers and allow tenants to repay their arrears through installments.&nbsp;I am also thankful for all the hard work by MOM, all the other Government agencies and the NGOs who have worked tirelessly to help our migrant friends. Our migrant friends have worked hard to build, clean and maintain Singapore as the shining red dot we are today. I am glad we have not left them behind and have committed to improving their living conditions. I raised all these concerns in my previous speeches and I am thankful to everyone who has taken the time to share your concerns, feedback and suggestions with me. Thank you for speaking up.</p><p>&nbsp;Sir, we have given a lot but as I raised in my previous speeches, there is one more thing we need to give out. We can and we need to give time. Time for working parents to spend with and look after their young children during this difficult period.</p><p>&nbsp;During this pandemic, many parents are feeling the stress of trying to balance work and looking after their children, especially helping their young ones with home-based learning (HBL).&nbsp;As Zack, a parent, shared with me, \"Imagine working from 9.00 am to 6.00 pm. Reached home about 7.00 pm. Have dinner until 7.30 pm. And only having this time, 7.30 pm to 9.00 pm, to check on the kids\\' HBL. Kids must sleep at 9.00 pm to ensure nine hours of healthy sleep. Super tiring. Yet, we endured for the sake of our children\".&nbsp;</p><p>Many parents are especially worried about how they will cope with alternating weeks of HBL for non-graduating students. It will be difficult for parents who are unable to work from home. Who will look after their children? Not everyone has grandparents who can help and even for those who do, they might not be able to help during this period.</p><p>&nbsp;Another parent shared with me, \"I have two Primary school going kids. Primary 1, Primary 2. Who is available to guide them on HBL days during Phase One? Grandparents aren’t computer literate. If there isn’t any HBL plus Google meet plus video call, I will choose to deposit them at my parents house easily. If I have to take annual leave to guide their HBL, employer won’t allow.\"</p><p>I know Minister Ong has stated, \"Schools will be prepared to extend limited care to young students on HBL but without childcare arrangements\".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;It will also be difficult for parents who can work from home. They are expected to meet their bosses\\' deadline and to be equally productive, even as they try to give their young ones attention and guide them on HBL. Do they please their employers or the children?</p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">I know firsthand how difficult it is. For the past two months, I worked from home with three little ones who had HBL. Ella is now six years old and Katie and Poppy are three years old. You cannot leave them to do HBL on their own. It is impossible.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">They have also attended many of my Zoom work meetings, climbed on my shoulders when I am clearing emails, and pulled my hands and legs, wanting me to play with them when I am drafting speeches. This happened when I was drafting this speech last Saturday.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Parents truly appreciate this opportunity to work from home. As Zyen, another parent, shared, “WFH with an infant is really no joke. Always have to work till midnight to complete the work. But I do, really cherish and appreciate. I‘ve been there when she flipped, sat up by herself and now standing with support. Gonna miss this bittersweet timing”.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Sir, more than anything, parents feel guilty that we cannot give our children the attention they need even though they are right there in front of us.&nbsp;I am not the only one with kids climbing on my shoulders. Amelia shared that, “My son climbs onto my shoulders while I work, too. I feel guilty for being impatient with my daughter who asks questions or wants to share something with me while I’m rushing my work”.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">I know there is no easy solution, especially during these difficult times. I know employers are equally stressed.&nbsp;But we need to give parents some breathing space and help them balance both work and family commitments.&nbsp;It is good that the Government has asked employers to be more empathetic to the challenges working parents face but we need to do more than that.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">We cannot leave this important issue to the discretion of the employer. The Government needs to step in to help and to mandate like how we have done so in so many areas in tackling this pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">We need to remember the issue does not just stem from alternating weeks of HBL. What about parents whose children are required to stay home because they are exhibiting COVID-like symptoms? Many pre-schools rightly ask a child to go home if he or she shows a single symptom. But a lot of parents are affected because of this.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">An educator in a childcare centre shared with me that, “On the ground, parents tend to negotiate with teachers if teachers were to reject children from entering schools due to respiratory symptoms with reasons that they are unable to get leave from work or no one to take care of their children”. Some parents, “would suggest to teachers to keep children at the sick bay the entire day until the parents end work”.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Let us not forget that there are also school closures due to positive COVID-19 cases, Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notices.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">As I have previously stressed, our current childcare leave entitlement is already insufficient during a regular year.&nbsp;Now, in the most irregular year, how can parents possibly have sufficient childcare leave?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">The only option left for many parents is unpaid leave. Indeed, many parents have shared that they are doing just that. But in this business climate, parents fear losing their jobs if they continue to take unpaid leave.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">To help parents, I hope we can introduce a Government-paid COVID-19-related childcare leave for parents whose children need to stay home due to COVID-19-related issues. By calling for it to be Government-paid, this would ease the financial burden for employers, whom I know are equally stressed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Sir, this leave is critical for those who are unable to work from home. This includes parents working in essential services who perform a duty for our nation, who keep us safe. We need to make sure that they are looked after, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">For parents who are working from home, this COVID-19-related childcare leave can help take off the pressures of balancing competing work and childcare responsibilities. They can take this leave when needed, such as helping their child catch up with HBL and their school work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Sir, we will not be the first country to provide a COVID-19-related childcare leave. Other countries have already taken steps to help working parents facing childcare challenges as a result of this pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">In the US, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act expands paid leave options for working parents who are unable to find childcare arrangements, entitling them up to 12 weeks of partially paid family leave. This includes parents working from home.&nbsp;Businesses whose employees take this leave pay for it through a refundable tax credit administered by the Department of Treasury.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">In Canada, working parents are entitled to job-protected leave of absence for up to 16 weeks under federal law, allowing parents to attend to childcare and eldercare needs while protecting them from being fired or penalised.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">In Italy, the government extended annual parental leave by 15 days for parents with children aged up to 12 years.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">In Belgium, the government introduced a special parental leave for parents of children under the age of 12 where parents can take leave in the form of 1/2 or 1/5 reduction of working time. This means working half time or one day off a week, taken in any combination of weekly or monthly blocks.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Other countries have adopted a variety of measures – tax credits, protection against discriminatory firing, increase in annual leave and flexible leave. I believe some combination of these solutions would provide our working parents the support they so desperately need.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Sir, in conclusion, we cannot leave it to employers and employees to work out amicable arrangements to balance business needs with childcare needs in this difficult time. In this difficult time, the Government has to step in. We should; other countries have already done so.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">I hope the Government will consider introducing a Government-paid COVID-19-related childcare leave and provide it at least until the end of Phase Two of the re-opening after the circuit breaker.&nbsp;Many parents are calling for this and I hope the Government will support them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">“Spend time with those you love, one of these days you will either say I wish I had or I’m glad I did.”</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Let us give our working parents the time they need to spend with their children during this pandemic and let us all value the precious time we have with our loved ones.&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget. Together, we will beat this virus.</span></p><h6>12.21 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, before I start, I would like to thank Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his team at MOF for their hard work in devising a fourth Budget within a space of four months. I also appreciate the sensitive consideration of naming each Budget such that we are emotionally connected to them.</p><p>\"Fortitude\" is an excellent name for this Budget as we dig deep into courage to face the painful effects of an unfolding economic crisis. The pain is widespread. Many have reached out to me with their stories. Witnessing this suffering has compelled me to file cuts tomorrow, so that the issues faced by struggling groups are raised to this House. Public rental households are one such group.</p><p>The number of households who have suffered complete loss of income since the beginning of April has risen sharply. Average income levels have gone into freefall. On the ground, community organisations have observed that households face mounting debt, including rent arrears. MND shared that “about 5,200 public rental households, or about 10% of all public rental households, are in rent arrears”. Around one in four such households owes more than $3,000 in rent.</p><p>As the economic impact of COVID-19 worsens, we can expect that more households residing in rental flats will struggle to pay rent. The Deputy Prime Minister said in his Ministerial Statement last week, \"Our path forward will be tough, but we will journey together\". So, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he could consider waiving six months’ rent for all households residing in rental flats, except for those whose rent is already covered under financial assistance from ComCare. This will provide immediate and targeted relief that goes directly to the low-income households in need.</p><p>For context, the Government is extending $334 million in rental relief for Government tenants in this Budget. A further $2 billion will offset SMEs’ rental costs.<sup>. </sup>A similar waiver for rental flat households would cost between $16 million and $57 million, based on my rough calculation.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, while acute pain is undeniable and deeply felt by both citizens and migrant workers, future shocks could be more frequent and unprecedented. The World Economic Forum has called turbulence “the new normal” in its latest Global Risks Report. I will focus on the long term in this speech.</p><p>The hard work of Singaporeans and Singapore companies, as well as prudent financial management of our Reserves, has allowed us to save up for this rainy day. It is only fiscally responsible for us to ensure that we spend the monies to build a stronger foundation for this new turbulent normal. This demands that we push boundaries and reimagine a social and economic structure that is more responsive, flexible and interconnected.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, let me first outline why a re-imagination and deep transformation is the only prudent way forward. I will then discuss the considerations in our current spending and planning processes that can set us on the path towards this stronger, more sustainable and more inclusive future.</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng mentioned that this Budget’s focus is to “enable our businesses and workers to adapt, transform and seize new opportunities”. Indeed, but even more so, our society and economy need a deep transformation.</p><p>The COVID-19 crisis has shown us unequivocally that human health is intrinsically linked to planetary health. Our increasing urbanisation and disruption of ecological balances increase our risks of exposure to pathogens. Last year, the Clinicians for Planetary Health initiative was launched. It committed to increase awareness of the severe public health impacts of environmental change. Therefore, it is safe to say that to safeguard our economic future, the balance of resources across people, planet and profit needs to be re-examined.</p><p>First, we can no longer look at our risk response in silo. Risks are multi-dimensional and cross-cutting, and must be addressed as such. Our healthcare system had integrated and implemented the playbook from SARS well – only 3.1% of our infections had been healthcare workers so far, compared to 41% for SARS. Yet, systemic gaps in worker welfare, specifically for migrant workers, left us unprepared for the infection levels in the dormitories. The risk assessment framework should have included the adequacy of safeguards for worker health. This would have required MOH and MOM to work together.</p><p>Second, existing societal inequities create disproportionate stresses on vulnerable communities. My previous speeches provided several examples of persons with mental health conditions, lower income households and migrant workers being disproportionately affected in terms of income loss and economic and psychological resilience. The digital divide amongst lower income families, the differently-abled and the elderly became more evident. All these could deepen social and community fault lines.</p><p>What does all this mean in terms of transformation? What society should we envision for ourselves?</p><p>I call for Singapore to move towards multi-stakeholderism. Governance-wise, this means a policy design process centred around and in collaboration with the actors with a “stake” in the outcome. Business-wise, it means considering workers, suppliers and customers equally.</p><p>Such considerations are not new. The World Economic Forum was established in 1971 to further the idea that business should serve all stakeholders. A hundred and eighty one CEOs of the Business Roundtable signed a statement last year, committing “to lead their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders – customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.”</p><p>Investors also value businesses that take care of its stakeholders. Workers are a major stakeholder. In April 2020, the International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) led by investors responsible for assets of $54 trillion called for companies to “prioritise employee safety and welfare” and “take a holistic and equitable approach to capital allocation decisions, considering the workforce”. Deputy Prime Minister Heng alluded to similar sentiments in parts of his speech.</p><p>The Government’s strategy to help Singaporeans ride through this crisis is by safeguarding jobs and income, which it is doing by supporting businesses. Across all four Budgets, around $28 billion has gone towards supporting immediate cash flow needs and overheads. This is about a third of the total Budget to date. The Government has also provided support through enabling credit access and matching investments for start-ups.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the intention to protect jobs and income to strengthen the economic position of our individuals and households. Reducing inequality would also increase resilience across our society, especially in times of hardship, so that economic buffers and important resources do not become accessible only to the privileged few.</p><p>Therefore, we must enact measures to protect individuals against employers who may be more interested in self-enrichment than in their workers’ rice bowls. Possible measures are curbs on layoffs, excessive executive compensation, and excessive use of share options in compensation structures that disproportionately align managers only to shareholders’ interests.</p><p>Government bailouts and support may reduce shareholders’ risk-bearing responsibilities. Safeguards against moral hazard can include: reducing dividends, restricting stock buybacks and requiring that any M&amp;A activity should seek to pay back the support provided, that is, a clawback.</p><p>Measuring and reporting should be used to hold companies accountable for how they have used Government grants, therefore taxpayers’ monies. An example is the independent accountability and transparency board created by the Obama administration in 2009. It performed a crucial monitoring function by requiring any entity receiving contracts, grants, or loans to file quarterly reports.&nbsp;</p><p>We could adopt a similar mechanism to ensure that companies channel Government support to those for whom it is intended. Corporate reporting requirements could compel companies to demonstrate behaviours that meet broader societal and sustainability goals.&nbsp;</p><p>We must also use the support packages as carrots for companies to actively enhance social equity by integrating community engagement and social responsibility into business strategy, so each can be a Company of Good&nbsp;– a national effort I believe Deputy Prime Minister is very familiar with. This could include an obligation to judiciously use the Business and IPC Partnership Scheme or BIPs, to make in-kind donations to charities.</p><p>Lastly, promoting sustainable business models will be key to building a better and safer future. McKinsey noted in April that “not only does climate action remain critical over the next decade, but investments in climate-resilient infrastructure and the transition to a lower carbon future can drive significant near-term job creation while increasing economic and environmental resiliency.” The President of the German Parliament recently called for the stimulus plan to focus on “climate policy, digitisation and innovation”.</p><p>Subsidies and support to companies accelerating climate change should come with conditions for absolute emissions reductions that enable us to accelerate our Paris Agreement commitments. As countries grapple with what a green and healthy recovery looks like, measurement and accountability may again be instrumental for change. The Task Force of Climate-related Financial Disclosures framework should be the norm. Science-based targets should form the basis of discussions on business transformations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Such requirements could be considered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as a cornerstone of future environment risk management guidelines for our financial industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These safeguards will require strong political will, Mr Deputy Speaker, because they will meet with resistance. But if we want a flexible and responsive society that is able to absorb shocks and rebound from them, I believe we must recalibrate current power structures for a fairer economy that considers key stakeholders in our economic system equally. I hope Deputy Prime Minister addresses this need for safeguards and conditions in his response.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government is demonstrating its commitment to longer term planning through the Emerging Stronger Task Force and the Future Economy Council. I applaud the intention. However, if we are to recognise a wide range of stakeholders in our future and commit to re-imagining the way forward, changes must be made.&nbsp;</p><p>I am glad to hear Deputy Prime Minister note that the Task Force will partner with SME owners, industry experts and trade associations as part of Emerging Stronger and his invitation for Singaporeans to participate. I would like to ask Deputy Prime Minister if there are plans to formalise this partnership and citizen participation under this Task Force. This is necessary to integrate meaningful and transparent input from all corners of society.</p><p>The current members of the Task Force represent industries that we have traditionally treated as pillars of our current economic structure, the composition does not represent the true diversity of economic players in Singapore. For example, I am surprised by the omission of SME, minority, even disability and mental health representation. Companies committed to delivering a sustainable future are also unrepresented, under-represented. So are women. I believe that if we sideline these views now, we are sabotaging our own futures and those of our children’s. Can I please ask the Deputy Prime Minister to ensure a more diverse and better representation on this Task Force to secure a truly resilient and united future for Singapore?&nbsp;</p><p>Unity, resilience, solidarity, fortitude. The names of the four extraordinary Budgets this year speak to our desire as a nation to overcome this crisis together and stronger. Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe that emerging stronger means placing our people front and centre of our plans for the future. Our economic structures must be realigned to put people first so that we build back better as a well-being economy&nbsp;post COVID. It will take our collective imagination, courage and collaboration to walk through this crisis and emerge stronger, together. Let us start the work for that to happen today with fortitude. I support the Budget.</p><h6>12.35 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;I welcome the $33 billion Fortitude Budget which will be used to counter the heavy impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our country. All governments around the world are taking unprecedented measures to mitigate the damaging impact of this outbreak and save the lives and livelihoods of their people.&nbsp;We are similar.&nbsp;Fortunately, past prudence has provided us with adequate emergency funds.&nbsp;</p><p>We are in the midst of a brutal war, the pandemic has claimed over 370,000 lives in the world within a few months.&nbsp;Fortunately, we have managed to keep most of our people here safe and the death rate low.&nbsp;This is a challenging war against the virus.&nbsp;It is different from other outbreaks that we have come across so far.&nbsp;To my understanding, it is infectious even a person has not developed any symptoms.&nbsp;Asymptomatic infections have made this task of overcoming it even more challenging and difficult.</p><p>Notwithstanding, we have to soldier on under these very trying circumstances, be resilient, stay united and help one another to overcome the obstacles ahead of us.&nbsp;We Singaporeans need to stay focused on a sustainable approach.&nbsp;By and large, we understand there is a limit to the handouts we can if we do not find sustainable income that provide long term and permanent social and family safety nets. Sir, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-Gan Thiam Poh Fortitude 5June2020-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>I am heartened by the effort to save and create jobs.&nbsp;I hope that more jobs can be created for the middle and senior age groups, particularly quality jobs. I am heartened by the response of our residents to the job offers, their willingness and courage in picking up new skills and adapting. I am glad that the Government has been focused on helping Singaporeans to both upskill and become equipped with new skills, to stay competitive and relevant in response to the market changes. There is a Chinese saying “When rowing a boat upstream, if one does not move forward, the boat will go backwards downstream”. Our people must persist in their efforts forward so that we can secure our place in the world.</p><p>More assistance will still need to be given to help Singaporeans, as the recovery of the world economy may not be so fast. For those who were retrenched last year and earlier, and had not been able to find jobs, they need help with job matching and retraining. This is especially for those aged above 40. In addition, some have expressed concerns that even with training, it does not necessarily lead to a job.&nbsp;</p><p>While the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) and Self-Employed Persons Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) provide welcomed relief, more salary or wage support can be given to help ease Singaporeans to upskill or reskill without having to worry about maintaining the family. I would like to suggest that we look at income matching, for example, a dollar to every two dollars earned for the 6 to 12 months, subject to a cap and overall scheme support budget of $9,000 per person under SIRS. This may be more sustainable.</p><p>Singaporeans should also adapt to tap upon technology and target not just Singapore, but the world as their market. Recently, a Singaporean actor took on a side job selling seafood for his friends on the Internet. To everyone’s surprise, including himself, he became an Internet celebrity, and companies and talent agencies from China rushed to contact him as their partner, asking him to promote all kinds of goods on the Internet. This is a very popular way of selling goods in China’s huge market today.&nbsp;While some of his language may be too colourful, his adaptability had created new opportunities for him. He can look forward to a very interesting new career. In Singapore, the Government has already started helping stallholders sell online and do live-streaming sales. Let us hope more business owners will try to change their operating models.</p><p>There has been feedback that there are still many who have been struggling with their businesses and who have been making sacrifices for the circuit breaker to the extent that they have been lending to their companies with their pay to support cashflow. Some have appealed for the Job Support Scheme (JSS) for working directors who are also shareholders. Instead of limiting the JSS to those who earn below $100,000 a year, why not remove this income cap? After all, the JSS is capped at 75% of $4,650.</p><p>Some are concerned that their businesses may not pick up after the reopening of our economy and thus will continue to face financial difficulty. It is important to them that all their clients order can be resumed.&nbsp;Otherwise, such business cannot hang on much longer. Even with the salary support from the Government, many businesses cannot afford to pay the balance 25% because they have zero revenue.</p><p>While we need to prioritise safety, and indeed, being a highly interconnected hub, we can only be safe if the world is also safe, however, we cannot be closed off from the world. It will do more harm than good to “de-globalise”.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to be proactive, not passive, to overcome this challenge. In order to survive, we cannot afford to sit back and keep drawing upon our past reserves and assets.</p><p>For example, we could consider staycations now that our community infection rate has been controlled. We should also start thinking how we could have effective and efficient test kits to check on all inbound travellers and returnees to prevent imported cases while revitalising the aviation, tourism and MICE sectors.</p><p>Most importantly, those who have the ability should help the have-nots. Because everyone is important and we care for all. Finally, let me conclude with a limerick.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>January: Complain about having to start work again</p><p>February: Panic buying of paper products</p><p>March: Causeway closed</p><p>April: Everyone stayed home&nbsp;</p><p>May: Resumption of work we hope&nbsp;</p><p>June: Worry about savings being depleted</p><p>July: Pray all will go smoothly</p><p>August: Celebrate victory</p><p>With this, I would like to conclude with my support for this Budget. Thank you.</p><h6>12.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Miss Cheng Li Hui (Tampines)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Budget.</p><p>Twenty-twenty is a year to reset, regroup and relearn. What is before us, is unprecedented. It is both a health crisis and an economic crisis that affects our life, our health and how we live our lives.</p><p>But far beyond our personal spheres, the world is rapidly changing. Tensions near and far, threaten to destabilise our once predictable place in the world. Global supply chains are also changing as countries ramp up their \"nationalistic\" strategies.&nbsp;Singapore has always depended on free and open trade. We need to regroup and strategise what is next for us, what can steer our economy into the future where businesses can thrive and individuals can progress.</p><p>Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we chart our path forward, I am particularly concerned about the challenges faced by our SMEs, especially the micro-businesses in our neighbourhood and hawkers. It is encouraging that the Government has set up the Emerging Stronger Task Force to study the systemic shifts emerging out of COVID-19. Other countries are also gradually ramping up their economies as they emerge out of lockdowns. We need to swiftly identify the economic shifts and strategise the way forward. Can the Minister for Finance shed some light on the work done so far and its first findings? How can we take advantage of new opportunities and accelerate our economic rebound?&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, in March 2018, I spoke about how we in our 40s today will become seniors of the future who will be more tech savvy and self-sufficient. We are also likely to be able to retire later as technology allows us to work from home. This COVID-19 pandemic has also affected seniors in many ways. I would like to highlight digital transformation. Microsoft estimates that two years of digital transformation was accomplished in the last two months. Forbes estimates five years of digital transformation to occur before mid 2021. These impacts have also been felt by our seniors, many of whom now communicate with video calls using WhatsApp or Zoom – something unheard of in 2019. Some seniors are also learning to shop online. Although there are no local studies released, in 2019, 40% of seniors aged 65 and above in Germany shop online.</p><p>As we forge ahead in our new post COVID-19 world, I anticipate far more online participation by our seniors than ever before.&nbsp;How can we capitalise on this digital transformation? How can we enable our seniors to be less isolated, more engaged with each other and with our society? What can we do with technology to help seniors connect with their families and friends and continue contributing to society and the economy even as they continue to earn a wage? As we protect the lives of our seniors by social distancing, we should also take care of their quality of social life by using technology.</p><p>I am heartened that the SG Digital Office will be hiring 1,000 Digital Ambassadors to help hawkers and seniors learn digital skills. It is great that the Government is reaching out to help bridge our digital divide and at the same time provide employment opportunities&nbsp;for our graduating cohorts of ITE, Polytechnics and Universities. I hope MCI will continue to accelerate our digitisation efforts post COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no doubt what we are experiencing is unprecedented. I hope when we look back to this period in the future, we can say we overcame&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;with unity, solidarity, resilience and fortitude. Let us press on.</p><h6>12.49 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir I support the initiatives introduced in Deputy Prime Minister Heng\\'s Ministerial Statement delivered in this House last week to protect Singaporeans\\' lives and livelihoods.&nbsp;He and hon Members who spoke before me, highlighted the deteriorating economic situation globally as well as in Singapore.</p><p>Against this deteriorating situation, I am heartened that Deputy Prime Minister Heng made good his promise made in this House when he was delivering the Ministerial Statement on the Resilience Budget. He said, \"should it become necessary, I am prepared to propose to the President further draws on past reserves to deal with the situation.\"</p><p>Our past reserves has been characterised as our trump card to get out of this crisis. Indeed, it is fortunate that we can draw on our past reserves, thanks to the prudence of previous generations of Government Leaders and Singaporeans.&nbsp;But equally, it is fortunate that Singapore can count on two further trump cards. They are: our exceptional people, who are all united in the common goal of defeating this virus and its effects on our health and economy; and our excellent men and women of the civil service. By civil service, I also include our Statutory Boards and our uniformed Services. I wish to record my appreciation to the officers in these Government agencies who have been working tirelessly throughout this crisis.</p><p>We all know our civil service is a lean organisation. With the formulation and implementation of numerous Government budgetary programmes and measures as well as legislation passed in this House within short periods of time, these officers had to rapidly adapt and assume even more responsibilities to support Singaporeans during this turbulent period. I, like a good number of hon Members have received reply emails from Government agencies on petitions written on behalf of residents promptly, despite a spike in the numbers. Many of these replies are received well after office hours.</p><p>The Government agencies and partners dealing with applications to draw on the Government\\'s COVID-19 support programmes do not have an easy task at all. They need to strike a balance between providing help to fellow Singaporeans, ensuring that the policy objectives of the programmes and legislation are achieved and satisfying themselves that the public resources are judiciously spent. At the same time, I am delighted to note that more and more, our Government agencies apply a degree of flexibility in assessing applications.</p><p>As an example, I recently received a note from a Senior Director of MSF who conveyed to me that MSF would administer the COVID-19 Support Grants (CSG) flexibly and not just by closely adhering to the criteria. This will ensure the policy objective of CSG of supporting lower to middle income Singaporeans who have lost their jobs, lost a significant proportion of the income or placed under no-pay leave are better served.</p><p>This is a welcome development. Our civil service is also transforming in its delivery efforts to better serve fellow Singaporeans. When we and our nation recover from this crisis, we should not forget the services of our men and women in civil service who went beyond their call of duty. In my view, it is not enough to pat them on their backs. We must follow up and provide tangible compensation to them. I made a similar call for our heroic frontline officers in my speech during the debate on the Unity Budget.</p><p>I would like to make three points in my speech on the Fortitude Budget. First, providing a permanent legal framework to help small businesses in crises, like the one we currently face. Second, encouraging the stakeholders in the charity sector to collaborate more so as to deliver more impactful programmes for Singaporeans who need help. And finally, providing more credit and cash flow assistance to middle income families.</p><p>On the first point, I am cheered by Deputy Prime Minister Heng\\'s announcement of the Government\\'s decision to introduce a Bill, mandating the more muscular landlords to grant rental waivers to the SME tenants whose businesses have been severely affected because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This measure deals with a big bugbear on the ground, given that most businesses in commercial premises have been closed for two months and are likely to be closed for at least a few more weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Heng mentioned that this was not an easy decision. He said \"Government does not ordinarily intervene in contracts after they have been entered into\". I appreciate the point Deputy Prime Minister Heng made.</p><p>This was the stance that was taken on behalf of the Government when I spoke on my Adjournment Motion \"Power Imbalance in Contracts Involving Small Businesses\" on the 5 February 2018. Then, I argued for Government intervention in form of legislation to protect small businesses to equalise their bargaining positions.&nbsp;I highlighted clauses in tenancy agreements that operate unfairly against tenants which are small businesses. I also drew examples of legislation being enacted in a number of advanced jurisdictions to help small businesses. The hon Senior Minister of State for Law as she then was,&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah stated as follows: \"In Singapore, our underlying philosophy is that, in general, free-market principles should apply and the Government should intervene only when necessary, for example, to address systemic market failure. Even when we do so, we try as far as possible to have the right regulatory touch and avoid heavy-handed interventions that could lead to distortion or unintended consequences\".</p><p>At this point in time, given the severe impact of COVID-19 pandemic on small businesses, especially in the F&amp;B and retail industries, I think it is right for Government to intervene to protect them or else they will disappear and the employees will be stranded.&nbsp;As it is well-known, two-third of Singaporeans are employed by SMEs.</p><p>The question I have is on whether we should take a temporary or permanent approach in dealing with such matters. Now that the Government has recognised that there is a need for intervention to help small businesses during crises, should there not be a permanent framework that can be applied as and when the situation calls for it in the future?</p><p>To illustrate the point, let us consider the important role the Price Control Act, an act which the Deputy Speaker is very familiar with, played during the crisis. The Price Control Act or PCA was enacted in 1950 to control prices of goods and to prevent price gouging. This was engaged in 1973 to fix the price of rice when it rose as a result panic buying, in the wake of the oil crisis. It is also used in 1990 when the pork market was reportedly cornered by a few suppliers. So, this is a lever that can be used when sellers take&nbsp;advantage of the situation created by crises.&nbsp;</p><p>Between January and February 2020, hon Members will recall that there was a public outcry against unscrupulous sellers taking advantage of the COVID-19 outbreak to sell surgical masks, thermometers and hand sanitisers at grossly inflated prices. The Price Controller took swift action under powers vested in him under PCA by requiring the sellers to provide information on the basis for setting prices at that level and also visiting the premises. The issues were quickly resolved without the need for the Price Controller to exercise his power to fix the price of masks, thermometers and hand sanitizers. Across the Causeway, the government used powers under the equivalent of the PCA to fix the price of surgical masks.&nbsp;</p><p>By similarly having a permanent framework to deal with rent issues faced by the small businesses, we will be in effect making Singapore\\'s economy more resilient. This is because the Government of the day can leverage on legislation to ensure that these small businesses will not go belly up in the face of similar crises in future. Time is of essence in such situations. Significant business disruption to such small businesses can be irreversible.&nbsp;There will also be the salutary signalling effect within the business community, as we saw in the case of masks sellers who self-regulated after the Price Controller launched queries into their business conduct.</p><p>I do appreciate that the shape, form and impact of crises in future may be different. The help measures may also differ from crisis to crisis. However, this need not mean that a permanent piece of legislation would lose relevance. However different the crises may be, the impact on small businesses in form of cashflow and cost will largely remain. For clarity\\'s sake, the circumstances when Government\\'s powers to intervene in the rental market may be triggered must also be spelt out too. The legislation may be worded broadly to provide for a wide spectrum of measures that the Government may impose to help our small businesses as we saw in the PCA example. I respectfully suggest that the Emerging Stronger Task Force of the Future Economy Council consider my proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>My next point concerns the support under the Fortitude Budget provided to the charity sector. In my speech during the debate on the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets, I highlighted the fact that some charities, especially the smaller ones, already were facing dwindling donations.&nbsp;I recall the hon Member, Mr Saktiandi also made the same point. However, we differed in the approach to be taken to deal with this problem. The hon Member, Mr Saktiandi suggested that the Government support the charities; I felt chary about this suggestion because of the Budget deficit we face this year and the fact that we are drawing on past reserves.&nbsp;</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng\\'s approach in providing dollar-for-dollar matching addresses both concerns. It incentivises donations and the same time provides much needed support to charitable organisations in the essential service or providing the vulnerable a helping hand. In principle, I support the move.&nbsp;</p><p>In my respectful view, however, the dollar-for-dollar matching should be combined with an outcome driven approach so as to incentivise charity organisations to collaborate and delivery quality programmes for Singaporeans in need.&nbsp;Under this approach, there would be need for an analysis on the impact of the charitable programmes on the beneficiaries such that the more impactful programmes should be provided with more public funding. There should be also financial incentives for charities to collaborate, pool resources and scale up.&nbsp;</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng had noted that many individuals and organisations have stepped up to his call to help Singaporeans in need. With the increased number of charitable funds and individuals wanting to do charity work, there is an opportunity get charitable organisations with similar ideals and objectives to work together to ensure that the dollar provided by our Government is better spent.</p><p>It may well be that our Government will have to deepen its capability to play the role of matchmaker in encouraging charitable organisations to work together.&nbsp;This will, in my view, accelerate the transformation of the charity sector so that it will emerge stronger from this crisis to serve Singaporeans in need.</p><p>I now turn to my final point.&nbsp;Our Government has taken decisive steps to ensure that banks better support individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;What I fear though is that if the economy dwindles even further, more families, especially middle-income families who are not the primary targets of the care and support package,&nbsp;will find themselves more cash strapped. We all recognise that there is a limit to payments such as the Solidarity Payment or the Temporary Relief Fund that the Government may make. Such amounts may not be even sufficient.</p><p>Cash strapped middle income families may be living in HDB or private properties. For these asset-rich, cash-poor families, I wonder if the Government could consider nudging the financial institutions to provide hassle-free, low-interest home equity loan facilities secured by either (a) refinancing of the original mortgage facilities if the original mortgagee is a bank; or (b) by a second mortgage on their homes.</p><p>To my understanding, such options are not currently available for HDB flats. Traditionally, financial institutions are chary about being second mortgagees as, priority-wise,&nbsp;they rank below CPF and the first mortgagee. Also, the processing time can be long. The administration costs in terms of getting valuation and to draw up legal paperwork can be significant too.&nbsp;</p><p>I appreciate that this measure has to be carefully studied for its social impact because if families default on their obligations, the banks may have to foreclose on their homes. However, I think that this issue may be addressed by proper analysis and implementing safeguards on the part of banks.</p><p>Sir, my comments notwithstanding, I support the Fortitude Budget.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Dennis Tan.</p><h6>1.02 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought huge disruptions to global businesses and lives of people from virtually every country in the world. We are in arguably one of the most uncertain times in the history of mankind. No single government has been able to claim from the start they know how to navigate through the challenges posed by COVID-19 and the consequences it has brought to countries, cities, societies and economies.</p><p>Our Government of 55 years since our Independence is no exception. To that, we have an unprecedented four Budgets in a short period of less than four months.</p><p>Like everywhere else, the disruptions brought on by COVID-19 have unsettled businesses, lives and governments. This is a sign of things to come in the world, where no government can claim that their past experience will provide useful relevance for the uncertain future.&nbsp;In this brave new world, many heads with different ideas working out consensual solutions for the common good must be preferred.</p><p>I will start on the issue of support for businesses.</p><p>In the past two months, under the circuit breaker period, businesses have received support under the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS), limited to 75% or up to $4,600 of every salary. Under this Fortitude Budget, for the months ahead, only selected industries such as listed in Tiers 1 and 2 of the JSS will continue to receive wage supplements of up to 75% of each worker\\'s salary. For most businesses, they will only be receiving up to 25% of the first $4,600 of every worker\\'s salary for the remaining payments under the JSS, and this Fortitude Budget will only bring one additional month\\'s payment, limited to 25% of an employee\\'s salary.</p><p>As most businesses stop receiving the 75% wage support coming out from the circuit breaker period, we may start to see a more accurate picture of businesses suffering and insolvency figures for companies rising later this year.</p><p>The Government has announced that it will provide a cash grant to offset rental costs of SME tenants and also pass a new law to ensure landlords pass on rental support from the Government. This will be welcomed as a small temporary relief of 0.64 of a month\\'s rental for office and industrial properties and 0.8 of a month\\'s rental for commercial properties. Unfortunately, to businesses who cannot open or operate or even for businesses who face a significant drop in their businesses at this time, it may not stave off business and cost pressures in a significant way. In effect, it will be too small an amount to save ailing businesses.</p><p>Perhaps the assistance by way of JSS and rental support could have been more targeted and not applied to businesses who may not be affected, for example, supermarkets or certain businesses in healthcare, pharmaceutical or IT sectors, just to name a few. In this way, more will be available to the businesses who need them. We should not rely on unaffected businesses to voluntarily return their payouts.</p><p>The announced support in the Fortitude Budget for digital transformation whether for purpose of boosting e-payments or the digital resilience bonus may help to promote e-payments and to allow safe management practices in COVID-19 settings. While they may assist with business continuity under unique COVID-19 operating conditions, these schemes may be less helpful in generating business or revenue in themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>The financing support for promising start-ups under the Fortitude Budget may help some new start-ups but are probably irrelevant to the bulk of our existing SME businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond the above-mentioned schemes, beyond the foreign work levy waivers and rebates announced in this Fortitude Budget, beyond the assistance from credit loans announced in previous budgets, I am concerned that many SME businesses will still require more assistance if we are to expect them to survive. What are the Government\\'s plans to support them to tide through the months or year ahead beyond what has been announced under the Fortitude Budget?&nbsp;</p><p>Has the Government factored in any actual draft plans in arriving at the additional $13 billion Contingencies Funds asked for in this Fortitude Budget and if so, whether it can now share such plans with Singaporeans too?</p><p>I next move on to the challenges during the circuit breaker and the issue of letting businesses open up with less restrictions.</p><p>The circuit breaker has not been an easy period for many businesses and individuals. Some businesses are baffled why similar businesses did not always result in the same exemptions or the same manpower allocation ratios. Instructions have changed over the weeks for some businesses ranging from meal arrangements for hawkers to types of businesses allowed to be opened or types of merchandise allowed to be sold.</p><p>In the first few weeks of the circuit breaker, provision shops and minimarts in different Hougang precincts were given different directions. Some were told they were only allowed to sell food. Some were told that they were not allowed to sell mops, brooms, brushes, pails, cleaning liquids, even slippers and limited stationery. Some were allowed to sell with no restrictions. Operators were baffled as some of these items have been sold in NTUC FairPrice without restrictions. Thankfully, after the Hougang Member of Parliament sought clarifications, the authorities reached out and rectified the instructions given.</p><p>In the circuit breaker period, most businesses were required to stop operating in their premises and most employees could not work in their working premises and had to stay at home. Those who could still do some or all of their work at home were the lucky few ones as for many jobs and many businesses, telecommuting is either not an option at all or not an adequate option for a variety of reasons. Many businesses have been looking forward to the resumption of operations in their premises. Yet, it has been somewhat confusing and uncertain for many business owners whose businesses were supposedly cleared for resumption.</p><p>Minister Chan Chun Sing was reported in the media on 19 May to have said as follows, \"Only those who require the use of machinery and specialised terminals or need to complete legal documentation will be able to return to their workplaces. Workers who need infrequent access to the workplace for information or materials can already do so on an existing time-based exemption... The rest of the workers will continue to work from home. This will allow more than three-quarters of our economy to resume their normal operations.\"</p><p>These caveats are a challenge to viable resumption for many businesses. To continue with telecommuting per se may not be a viable option for many as telecommuting may suit certain positions but not others, and viable work that is required to be carried out in the office and unsuitability for telecommuting goes beyond the over-simplified description of merely requiring \"the use of machinery and specialised terminals or need to complete legal documentation\", especially bearing in mind many businesses will as I have highlighted earlier see their wage support under the JSS reduced to 25% from June onwards.</p><p>Productivity is another area of concern.&nbsp;The Government can be less prescriptive in this area, including any current limitation in the number of workers allowed in the workplace.&nbsp;Let businesses take ownership in managing telecommuting and the extent of telecommuting as appropriate for each individual business and their bottom line. Where any of these employees are required to be in the office or for workers where telecommuting has limited&nbsp;application, the Government can leave the onus on businesses to carry out prescribed safe workplace practices, including having appropriate social distancing and safe seating arrangements, use of SafeEntry,&nbsp;keeping records of staff and visitors to premises, including temperature records and good cleaning practices.&nbsp;</p><p>Let businesses focus on recovery with more breathing space. I am sure that most businesses will understand that their business operations are subject to closure due to failure in social distancing and safe workplace arrangements or in the event of an actual infection and most will take the necessary protective steps accordingly.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, next, I would like to seek an update from the Minister for Manpower in the number of foreign workers who are still currently not allowed to leave their dormitories to go to work.&nbsp;Further, is the Minister able to give a projected estimation of the number of these workers who will be released back to work in each of the next two to three months?&nbsp;</p><p>I am asking these questions because pending a review of our labour policies in the near future&nbsp;– perhaps after the COVID-19 crisis, particularly on our current unhealthy level of reliance on cheap foreign labour and also the way we house them, in the meantime, we need these workers to be back helping to restart our economy and also at the end of the day, the workers do not ordinarily live and work outside of Singapore and they are part of our community.</p><p>I am also asking these questions because it touches on how confident the Government is in bringing down infection in the foreign worker dormitories to zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I want to touch on safe connectivity with the world. Last Friday, the Government announced plans to launch \"fast lane\" arrangement with COVID-19 measures for essential business, official air travel between Singapore and China in early June, starting with six Chinese cities. Prior to that, the Government had also announced that there will be talks to reopen borders with New Zealand.&nbsp;</p><p>Quite understandably, we cannot stay unconnected for too long and the opening up of air travel and connection with these and, indeed, other countries will be beneficial to our businesses and economy.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, we have had recent experience of significant COVID-19 infections brought about by arriving passengers from abroad, first with the Wuhan tourists in January bringing the first recorded cases and transmissions to Singapore and then later on with some of those returning to Singapore or visitors from abroad around the period of March and April.</p><p>For the Government\\'s plans to open up air travel in the coming months even with selected countries and pending the eventual introduction of a vaccine for COVID-19, I hope that all necessary measures will be taken to ensure that the reopening will not lead to a resurgence of imported COVID-19 cases.</p><p>It has been reported that passengers will not be required to serve the 14-days quarantine period and they will be required to undertake swab tests before boarding and after arrival in Singapore.&nbsp;If swab tests are required before boarding a flight to Singapore, how do we ensure all overseas swab test results provided are reliable? For swab tests done on arrival, how will the Government ensure that pending the outcome of the testing, there will not be any risk to any persons with whom the passengers come into contact at the airport, at their selected accommodation and also while being transported to their accommodation? Are there any restrictions on their accommodation for this initial period?</p><p>Next, on safe travel on public transport.&nbsp;Minister Khaw Boon Wan announced on Monday that rail and bus services will return to pre-circuit breaker levels but indicated that safe social distancing may not be possible.&nbsp;This is disconcerting. Besides being a potential Achilles\\' heel in our fight against COVID-19, it is inconsistent with social distancing efforts that were carried out previously on trains during the circuit breaker. It is also inconsistent with the stringent enforcement efforts adopted in many other situations with regards to social distancing, for which many people have been fined or given warnings for breaches and the rationale for such enforcement.</p><p>Finally, President Halimah Yacob was reported to have stated her support for this Fortitude Budget.&nbsp;I wonder whether the President, in arriving at her conclusion to support the draw of $31 billion from our reserves as well as the previous draws from reserves under the previous Budgets, had already been advised of the total amount of reserves Singapore has and had taken this into consideration. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-Dennis Tan Fortitude 5June2020-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mr Deputy Speaker,&nbsp;we may start to see the number of business failures going up in the next few months, leading to more job losses. After May, most businesses will receive 25% wage support and the Fortitude Budget will only increase support by one more month of such wage support. I would like to ask the Minister to extend more support to our SME businesses especially those who are struggling.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I also hope that the Government will extend more flexibility to businesses who are cleared to resume business on their premises, to manage their businesses as they see fit as long as they comply with safe distancing and other safe workplace practices as required by the Government.</p><p>&nbsp;As for the Government’s plans to resume airlinks with China and New Zealand, it is important to resume connection for the benefit of our economy. However, I hope the Government will take all necessary measures to ensure that we will avoid another wave of foreign imported COVID-19 infections.</p><p>As more rail and bus services are resumed in phase 1, 2 and 3, I also hope that the Government take all necessary measures for safe travel and social distancing especially during peak hours. The relaxation of social distancing in our trains since Tuesday is a huge concern. Lack of social distancing on public transport is inconsistent with the authorities’ stringent enforcement efforts in social distancing elsewhere, not to mention a potential Achilles heel in our fight against COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, President Halimah Yacob was reported to have stated her support for this Fortitude Budget. I wonder whether the President, in arriving at her conclusion to support the draw of $31 billion from our reserves as well as the previous draws from reserves under the Solidarity and Resilience Budgets, had already been advised of the total amount of reserves Singapore has and had taken this into consideration.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Terence Ho.</p><h6>1.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Terence Ho Wee San (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I thank Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his team for always having arts in his heart and making arts possible and vibrant, even during this COVID-19 situation. I also want to thank the colleagues in MCCY and the National Arts Council (NAC) for their dedication and commitment to keep arts going strong. They work tirelessly to render support in this difficult period.</p><p>As at 22 May 2020, NAC has supported more than 850 artists and arts groups, funded more than 60 digitalisation projects and reached over 6.2 million online views.&nbsp;If we take into consideration of the other online digital programmes by the arts groups, we should reach more than 10 million online viewers as today. Singapore Chinese Orchestra\\'s digital efforts has seen six series, more than 130 contents uploaded, and a total of more than one million viewership to-date. Singapore Symphony Orchestra\\'s SSOPlayOn! series, the Siong Leng Musical Association and the Nam Hwa Opera have brought their art onto several social media platforms for all to enjoy. The theatre groups live-stream their performances and the Esplanade partners with SISTIC to provide pay-per-view tickets to achieve self-sustained model for online performances.</p><p>In these difficult times, we need the arts and culture to uplift our spirits. I hope the artists and arts groups can tap on the Fortitude Budget to sustain works, spread positivity and make arts as an essential for everyone in the new normalcy. They can explore and tap on the Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme, SEP Income Relief Scheme, COVID-19 Support Grant and the Arts and Culture Resilience Package (ACRP). The $55 million ACRP seeks to protect the arts and culture eco-system and will provide support and opportunities for our cultural organisations and practitioners until the end of the year, while encouraging the development of longer-term capabilities that will help the community emerge stronger after COVID-19.</p><p>I have four suggestions. One, cultivate concert virtual exposure acquired by the expanding digital consumers of arts to actual engagement. Two, capability building should revamp and remodel in the strategic marketing area to bring headcounts for the various arts form, especially for ticketed events. Three, digital culture pass to encourage pay-per-view digital concert and even purchasing of live concert tickets when we allow concert to be staged at the concert hall. Four, more can be done to commission and collaborate with the private and public sector to utilise collective resources for the arts presentation in a more effective way.</p><p>Arts are the engines of togetherness and collective sense-making. A lost in cultural eco-system would be harder to re-cultivate than to restore anything.&nbsp;In Mandarin, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-Terence Ho Fortitude 5June2020 -Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank Deputy Prime Minister Heng and his team for always having the livelihood of artists and arts group in their heart. The Government pays great attention to the arts and the cultural sector, making arts an indispensable spiritual nourishment during the outbreak.&nbsp;</p><p>NAC and Lianhe Zaobao worked together to launch the Zaobao Recital Series comprising four online programmes, including Chinese music, vocals, classical chamber music and literature reciting. Netizens have responded warmly to these online programmes.</p><p>The enhanced Job Support Scheme has enabled many art groups and artists to maintain their livelihood during the outbreak and continue to create artworks and surprises, so that people can continue to enjoy arts performances online. For example, Singapore Chinese Orchestra staged the Tutti Singapore percussion performance; Singapore Symphony Orchestra uploaded SSOPlayOn! series, and Singapore Chinese Music Federation gathered 30 Erhu players to present a performance called \"Towards a Brighter Future\" in celebration of the 30th anniversary of Singapore-China diplomatic ties. Dingyi Music Company, Siong Leng Musical Association, Nan Hwa Opera and the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre have also created many online stay-home performances. They use advanced digital technologies to bring arts onto various social media platforms, so that their audiences can enjoy wonderful concerts and performances free at home. There are more than 10 million online viewership to-date.</p><p>During this period, many enthusiastic supporters are paying special attention to the vulnerable groups by giving them donations and support. This is good. I feel that freelancers in the arts and cultural sector will need our help too. The existence of our local arts and cultural community is the spirit and hope of the society. This group of people will not be the first to come to people\\'s mind to help. Their livelihood is not easy in the first place, and made worse by the outbreak. The support they received is far from enough, and this reflects the fundamental cultural attitude of a society. In this regard, we need a wider definition of arts and broader arts recognition among our people, so that more people are willing to support and promote arts and spread its values.</p><p>I hope that artists and arts groups can make good use of the funding and grants in these difficult times, move on with fortitude and continue to innovate and create. I believe that the community will emerge stronger and more united after COVID-19. The development of arts and culture would also be different from before. We will need new engines and new concepts to create a new world. I hope we can bring online audiences to concert halls and theatres. After artists have returned to the stage, I believe they will be able to create more inspiring programmes. This is because arts can provide spiritual nourishments, lift people\\'s mood and warm their hearts. We will definitely conquer COVID-19, start a new life accompanied by beautiful music and artistic creations, and unite as one people to march towards prosperity and progress.&nbsp;</p><p>I support the Fortitude Budget.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><p>(<em>In English</em>): I am in support of the Fortitude Budget.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leon Perera.</p><h6>1.26 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, across the world, governments, healthcare systems, companies, societies and families have been severely tested by a microscopic virus. We will continue to be tested. We will need to meet these tests as one united people, united by our love for our country and one another</p><p>Looking back, for me, the past two months have been extraordinary, working with Party colleagues and volunteers to provide support to residents remotely, adapting corporate processes to work from home and making adjustments to family life with my two young children, aged 12 and 14, going through home-based learning.</p><p>Now, our attention turns to the process of recovery. It is appropriate that an Emerging Stronger Task Force has been formed. I agree with the remarks made by my Party Chairman Ms Sylvia Lim on the composition and work of that task force.</p><p>As a society, it is our collective responsibility to reflect, draw the right lessons and emerge stronger. After all, the world went through the cataclysm of the Spanish flu in 1918 but many lessons about preventing and controlling pandemics were not permanently and widely institutionalised after that trauma.</p><p>We have a choice. Will we emerge stronger? What can we learn from this episode for this post-circuit breaker period and the post COVID-19 future that Singapore will emerge into?</p><p>I would like to speak about two areas&nbsp;– overall pandemic management and the economy.</p><p>At the start of the pandemic, the Government quickly formed a whole-of-Government task force and issued regular communications. The challenge facing this task force was gargantuan. Our knowledge of COVID-19 was imperfect and evolving. There were many moving parts. In hindsight, though, many Singaporeans, looking back on the rules and announcements issued since early April, would say that there were too many finely calibrated rules. These were often qualified or changed shortly after being announced and this led to confusion on the ground. Let me cite a few examples.</p><p>On 21 April, when the tighter circuit breaker measures were announced, the press release said outlet-based confectionery operations had to be suspended from 2359 hours on 21 April, but those selling mainly bread could continue. What followed was some confusion as those selling mainly cakes try to find out what they could do. It was clarified that they could sell their inventory of cakes but not bake new ones. Some bakeries, such as one making mainly croissants, had to clarify how the rules apply to them.</p><p>Car workshops were another example. Initially, when the circuit breaker was announced, motor workshops were told they could apply to stay open but only for emergency services. A Straits Times\\' report from 7 April said that motor workshop operators were confused initially by the phrase \"emergency vehicle services\" found in the GoBusiness COVID-19 site. Do they mean emergency vehicles like ambulances or do they mean emergency services for vehicles, one asked.</p><p>Another example, in late April it was announced that exercising and dog walking were not permitted within the common areas of condominiums. One letter writer to TODAY on the 30 April mentioned that \"to access public spaces, dogs would have to traverse the common condominium grounds thus rendering the rule moot in practice.\" Such a rule may also have had the effect of condominium dog owners then crowding in adjacent pathways by the road, HDB or landed common areas or parks.</p><p>The intent behind these finely calibrated and frequently revised rules was good. But in hindsight, could the technocratic zeal have been tempered by an appreciation that the capacity of society to adapt to so many frequently changing rules is not unlimited, while the capacity of any civil service to issue so many detailed and finely calibrated rules in a very short time is limited.</p><p>Too frequent and unclear rules can lead to rules fatigue and cynicism towards rule compliance.&nbsp;Moreover, would it not have been more efficient for the exceptions and caveats to rules to have been announced at the same time as the rule. And could some rules that micro-manage what are permissible activities have been avoided in favour of making facility owners responsible for safe distancing, masking and so on?</p><p>Sir, my colleague Mr Dennis Tan has also made some suggestions on the roll-out of Phase One, with which I agree. I would add one point. The Government\\'s approach to Phase One and beyond hinges on demarcating companies into either an essential or non-essential category for each phase. So, for example, in Phase One most retail, cinemas, bars, restaurants, event-based activities and tuition centres remain shut. This is in spite of the fact that crowds and lack of safe distancing have been anecdotally observed in a number of supermarket outlets and shopping malls under current rules, and that safe distancing is no longer mandatory on public transport.</p><p>&nbsp;We need to find the right balance between protecting livelihoods and protecting lives.&nbsp;Has the Government considered an alternative approach which is to calibrate this a little less finely and with a broader brush. This means allowing most establishments to open may be with the exception of those which pose the most extreme risk. But every establishment would be tasked to practise safe distancing, masking and other precautions. This would mean that some establishments would, perhaps, not be able to optimise capacity to economically viable levels. But should we not that choice to business owners? Some business owners may prefer to restart with reduced capacity so as to generate some cashflow, refresh connections with customers, start to rotate staff back to work for the sake of morale and skills refreshing and so on.&nbsp;For those industries where the risk is greater, these should be targeted for more enforcement and regular preventive COVID-19 testing.</p><p>In fact, the administration of rapid testing and swift isolation in a surgical manner, as opposed to only very severe lockdowns, has been seen as a key to Korea\\'s success, which brings me to my next point on testing.</p><p>Sir, our current main form of testing appears to be the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or RTPCR test. Some challenges of scaling up the current PCR test are that testing takes about three hours for results to be obtained. Laboratory staff operating the extractors must also wear personal protective equipment or PPE and most countries looking to exit lockdown have similar mass testing strategies&nbsp;– increasing demand for the same reagents and PPE.</p><p>MOH has said that coronavirus test were conducted by 13 laboratories in Singapore, the majority of which are located at public healthcare institutions such as hospitals. There are private sector industrial testing labs that offer testing of COVID-19 on surfaces, not patient swabs. It is not clear if these labs currently also offer testing of human samples since this is not advertised. It would be good to know if these industrial labs can be co-opted to help with our testing.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the challenges in scaling up the PCR testing method, there is a need to concurrently explore scaling up of other testing methods to be able to roll out effective mass testing. The Tony Blair Institute in the UK has called for antibody tests to be more widely used in conjunction with the PCR test, even if it is less accurate. Could such antibody tests together with the current PCR test be used to triage testing of suspected cases to take the load off the PCR testing infrastructure.</p><p>Next, Sir, a number of new schemes have been rolled out. For example, there is a $100 utilities rebate in this latest Fortitude Budget&nbsp;– $100. Previously, SIRS and JSS were rolled out. Before COVID-19 there were also many schemes. To cite some random examples&nbsp;– Workfare, Jobs Credit, Innovation Credit and SkillsFuture. Some schemes are automatically applied and money gets transferred into&nbsp;your bank account. That is it. Some schemes you have to apply for to get the money or support. For other schemes, the money exists in an account tagged to each citizen and you have to use it.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, the more schemes we have, the more there is risk of confusion leading to under-utilisation or other side effects. Also, the more complex the whole system becomes the more resources need to go into the work of explaining, sifting through and helping people or firms to apply for these schemes. Social workers and Family Service Centres and officers at economic agencies like Enterprise Singapore, for example, would have to meet this challenge by mastering all the minutiae of the schemes and then explaining them well.</p><p>Sir, there are just too many schemes with distinct names and processes right now.</p><p>Would the Government consider a unified portal across the whole-of-Government where each citizen and company can log on, view and transact? Such a portal would show firstly, that the monies that have been credited from all schemes that automatically kick in; two, the schemes which that person or company is eligible to apply for; or where there is imperfect information where they may be eligible to apply for for those that need application with direct links to the application forms from respective Ministries, Statutory Boards and agencies; and thirdly, the money that has been credited to them in special accounts but which needs to be utilised by a certain date.</p><p>The existence of such a portal would be a first step. The next step would be to streamline the schemes and curb the tendency to launch new schemes but attempt instead to channel support into existing schemes. Sir, sometimes less is more. And in saying this, for the elderly who are less IT-savvy, arrangements need to be made to facilitate their access to such a portal.</p><p>Next, let me move to the economy. Minister Chan recently announced $13 billion in foreign direct investment commitments in the first four months of this year versus $15.2 billion for the whole of last year. This is good news indeed.</p><p>I would like to ask MTI how much of this $13 billion is fixed asset investment versus total business spending. How many jobs is this expected to be translated into? And what incentives were used to secure these investments?</p><p>It is important to continue to attract FDI and to refine and improve our strategies for doing so. But the economic challenge of developing home-grown entrepreneurship and our own world-beating companies is going to be greater than ever. World trade growth was already slowing own even before COVID-19. COVID-19 will not put in an end to FDI for sure. But it is likely to result in more competition for perhaps less FDI, as some multi-national companies or MNCs migrate some operations back home and other MNCs try to diversify to less traditional FDI destinations, responding to the imperatives of supply chain resilience, political pressures and other imperatives.</p><p>Sir, our GDP growth rate was a weak 0.7% in 2019 before COVID-19 and that 0.7% growth rate was one of the lowest rates of growth among major advanced economies in the world in that year. No doubt there are many schemes and programmes to stimulate entrepreneurship. Have these met with the desired results? Are we where we want to be?</p><p>In this House my colleagues and I have mooted a number of ideas on this front in the past. For example, setting up a fund to support ex-civil servants who want to become entrepreneurs and demonstrating more flexibility in schemes based on results.</p><p>Sir, NASA recently launched its first vehicle into space using private sector launch capacity provided by the company Space X. Uplifting our entrepreneurial sector is going to be a key national competitiveness challenge facing Singapore. I would argue for renewed soul searching and efforts on this front as an urgent priority. Mr Speaker, Sir, in Malay, please.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-5 June 2020 - Mr Leon Perera - Debate on DPM Statement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>The Government\\'s approach to Phase One and beyond hinges on the demarcation of companies into either an essential or non-essential category for each phase. This is in spite of the fact that crowds have been observed to continue visiting a number of supermarkets in shopping centres and are not really practising safe distancing under current rules. Has the Government considered an alternative approach, which is to calibrate this a little less finely, but in a broader manner instead? This means allowing most businesses to open, perhaps with the exception of those which may pose the most extreme risks. At the same time, every business should be required to practise safe distancing, the wearing of masks and all other precautions. And for those industries where the risk is greater, these should be targeted for more enforcement and regular, preventive COVID-19 testing.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Speaker, Sir, has COVID-19 shown that our model of economics and politics is perfect? No. Neither is any countries\\'. The success achieved by other developed countries in the region against COVID-19 such as Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and New Zealand should give us pause that we, too, have things to learn.</p><p>For example, if stronger independent voices had come out to say the precautionary reusable mask wearing was okay in the early days, it may have cut down on some asymptomatic transmission.</p><p>Last year, I read an excellent book called \"The Narrow Corridor\" by academics Daron Acemoglu&nbsp;and James Robinson. It uses extensive historical research spanning centuries to argue that the most successful societies are those that find the right balance between a strong, capable state and an equally strong non-state sector&nbsp;–&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">meaning civil society, alternative parties and the private sector </span>–&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">to balance that state. The outcomes of such successful societies are able to obtain combined political stability and law and order on the one hand together with long-term innovation-driven economic development and social progress on the other hand.</span></p><p>And so, in conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, at the end of this speech, I find myself returning to a theme in my very first speech in this House given in January 2016&nbsp;– the Singapore glass is half full. Singaporeans bear a major two-fold responsibility to preserve what is good about our existing system but to change what should be changed to make it better.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad.</p><h6>1.45 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Zaqy Mohamad)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker.&nbsp;“Your every day is full of sunshine.&nbsp;But into every life, a little rain must fall” – prose from a song by the legendary rock band, Queen.</p><p>We are living in very challenging times, with unpredictable weather ahead. They say that in every crisis, lies opportunity. Therefore, we should make the best of every opportunity available, no matter how strong the headwinds are. And this is why the Government and our tripartite partners are making every effort to create an umbrella of opportunities to weather the storm.&nbsp;</p><p>I will speak about how our workers and employers can tap on the opportunities and support available. We will help workers be flexible, to adapt and to widen their skills. We will also provide support for employers to make use of their downtime to upskill their workforce for transformed jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>The Minister for Manpower has elaborated on the strong Government support for our workers and I will focus on how fresh graduates and our mature workers can tap on opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Our fresh graduates are entering the job market amidst great uncertainty. I can personally relate to the anxiety of many of our fresh graduates who may be concerned with their job prospects. I graduated in 1999, shortly after the Asian Financial Crisis. There were few jobs and even fewer interviews. But I would like to assure our fresh graduates and their parents, compared to them, we are now more prepared and better resourced to support our fresh graduates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the current economic conditions, there are still jobs available in some areas. We will support employers to take in and groom new hires, including through sector-specific programmes such as the Company-Led Training Programme for Infocomm and Technology jobs. Some may not be able to find employment in this tough job market, and this is why we launched the SGUnited Traineeships programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have more than doubled our initial goal from up to 8,000 traineeships to up to 21,000 traineeships. Our graduates can look forward to traineeships in sectors with good growth prospects such as Financial Services, Professional Services and Infocomm Technology and Media sectors.</p><p>There are familiar roles in Marketing and Finance too, and more specialised ones such as Sports Nutrition and Social Work. Graduates can check out available traineeships on MyCareersFuture.sg by searching for the hashtag #SGUnitedTraineeships.&nbsp;</p><p>On this note, I would like to thank the Singapore Business Federation for helping to vet and approve the large volume of traineeship proposals from companies. I would also like to acknowledge the many employers that have opened their doors to trainees. An example is Yang Kee Logistics, who will be offering traineeship opportunities in software development and food supply chain management.&nbsp;</p><p>Two trainees will support the Logistics Integrated Transport Ecosystem project, a cloud-based platform that connects logistics industry stakeholders and multiple intermediaries. They will be able to sharpen their software development skills and gain deeper project management skills. Another trainee will be exposed to Yang Kee\\'s new food logistics business arm as a sales support coordinator. These traineeship experiences will be meaningful and valuable, providing them skills that are in-demand and hands-on industry experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Traineeships help our fresh graduates to build their experience and skills. This puts the trainee in good stead to find a job, either with the host company or elsewhere in the sector. To give our trainees a further boost, employers that hire them will receive the enhanced Hiring Incentive, with salary support of 20% of monthly salary for six months, capped at $6,000 in total.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government will work with employers to provide as many jobs and traineeships as possible. As many opportunities are likely to come from firms in growth sectors, I encourage our graduates to keep an open mind and consider how skills acquired in school can be applied to different careers.</p><p>We are also paying close attention to our mature workers. Many of them may have been in the same occupation for a long time, and find it more challenging to make a career switch. As Mr Patrick Tay mentioned, we need to support our mid-career workers and we also need to help them access the opportunities available. How can mature workers do so?</p><p>First, do consider making the switch into a new career. I recognise that it is not easy, but you are not alone. Workforce Singapore\\'s Professional Conversion Programmes, or PCP, have helped nearly 14,500 Singaporeans since 2016 to successfully switch to new careers. The results are encouraging. About nine in 10 remain in employment for two years after getting a job, and seven in 10 earned higher wages. Clearly, the PCP has been effective in preparing our workers for new careers.</p><p>The Government provides up to 90% of salary support and course fees subsidies to encourage employers to hire mature workers through these programmes. We are also ramping up our capacity to provide more programmes.</p><p>One example is 55-year-old Choa Wai Sim – one individual who successfully made the switch. She previously worked in a traditional sales role performing tasks such as quality control and quotation of sales. While she initially applied for a salesperson role at Aries Fresh Private Limited, she was open to take on a different role focusing on digital sales offered by Aries Fresh in March this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to PCP for Digital Sales Executives, Wai Sim gained digital skills which complements her sales experience. I personally found it inspiring that Wai Sim has transformed her 30 plus years of experience to take on the digital world as well. She now uses Facebook and Google Ads to generate leads and increase sales. Wai Sim is earning 30% more, compared to her previous traditional sales role. She is an encouraging role model for all of us and I would like to thank Aries Fresh for investing in our mature workers and I hope that many others would consider this too.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, mature jobseekers can also consider taking part in the new SGUnited Traineeships for mid-career workers, which will be named SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme. This programme will provide mid-career workers with company attachment opportunities to pick up industry-relevant skills and broaden their professional circles. This will boost their employability when the economy recovers.&nbsp;</p><p>We aim to provide up to 4,000 of such attachment opportunities. Compared to the SGUnited Traineeships, mid-careerists on this SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme can expect to receive a higher stipend based on their relevant experience and skills that they bring to the host company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To encourage employers to hire mature workers who have gone through eligible programmes such as the SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme, we doubled the Hiring Incentive to 40% of monthly salary for six months, capped at $12,000 in total.&nbsp;</p><p>Our employers play an important role in growing our economy and hiring our workers. It is important that we also guide them through this storm. Even when employers are in \"survival mode\", their odds of survival will improve with a more skilled and productive workforce. I would like to encourage employers to take a longer-term view and walk with their workers through these challenging times.</p><p>Different employers are affected in different ways by this unprecedented crisis. The first group of employers are those who are not so badly affected and are still growing. And we encourage these employers to consider jobseekers who may not have all the skills needed to perform the job, but can do it with some training.</p><p>To support such employers, we will be ramping up the capacity of our career conversion programmes to more than 14,000 places this year. So, taken together with the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) and the enhanced Hiring Incentive, the out-of-pocket costs of employers for hiring and training new workers are significantly reduced.</p><p>For others who are cautious about hiring, do consider the traineeship programmes. I encourage you to offer as many positions as you can. Not only will you benefit from the additional manpower to meet your business needs, you will also help trainees pick up useful skills and work experience.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government will also subsidise the costs of providing these traineeship opportunities by funding 80% of the traineeship stipends. Employers only need to fund the remaining 20%. Host companies can indicate their interest at the SGUnited Traineeships page on WSG\\'s website.</p><p>Many employers may face short-term difficulties. We fully understand. Member of Parliament Patrick Tay expressed concerns about unfair practices on the ground, and I share his concerns. While it may not be easy, employers should be fair to their workers during hard times. The Government has provided significant wage support under the JSS to offset and protect local employees\\' wages. Employers should act responsibly and fairly. Those who put local employees on mandatory no-pay-leave or retrench them will not be entitled to the enhanced JSS pay-outs for those employees.</p><p>The updated Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment and National Wage Council\\'s guidelines issued in end-March provides guidance on managing excess manpower responsibly. Where there is a need to reduce wages, managements should lead by example, and seek the consent of the unions and engage employees.</p><p>Employers should take the lead to help their workers reskill and support business transformation plans. Employees have often been worried about training while working. For some, it is whether they can find time to go for training without disadvantaging themselves at work. Others may find it difficult to identify relevant training to improve their career prospects.&nbsp;</p><p>Employers should come in to provide guidance. They are best placed to identify relevant skills required for their business transformation strategies. It is also a good opportunity to send workers who would have not otherwise have gone for training to reskill. Moreover, employers can reskill their existing workers at a low cost by tapping on Government support.&nbsp;</p><p>Employers can send existing workers to participate in job redesign programmes, a type of PCP to help existing employees take on new roles or redesigned job roles in the same company. Many employers think that PCPs are for workers to transit to new sectors, but there are also PCP programmes that employers can adopt in their companies. And the Government provides up to 90% salary support and course fee subsidies.</p><p>All Watches Private Limited is an employer that is reskilling their workers for enhanced job roles to support their digital transformation plans. They are ramping up its online e-commerce platform given the shift in consumer behaviour and increase in demand for e-commerce. Through WSG\\'s Job Redesign Reskilling Programme for the Retail Industry, 11 workers are gaining relevant digital skills. For instance, their retail team leaders will gain skills to understand online and offline customer behaviour and to develop and implement offline-to-online strategies in enhanced Customer Service Leader roles.</p><p>I encourage employers to consider this option. Not only would employers keep their workers at lower cost, their workers will emerge with new and relevant skills to support their business transformation and growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, before I conclude, let me address Mr Zainal Sapari\\'s points on lower wage workers, particularly those in essential services.&nbsp;</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted the importance of the work done by our essential workers, many of whom come under the Progressive Wage Model (PWM). For the majority of them, their workloads have increased during this period, and we applaud and appreciate their efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, this is an important group. MOM and our tripartite partners have been working hard to uplift this segment. To support our lower wage workers, we have recently enhanced Workfare to benefit more workers and also provided a special Workfare Special Payment (WSP) payout of $3,000 as a result of the COVID-19 situation. The first payout of $1,500 will be made in the next month, with the second payout of $1,500 in October 2020. In these times, it is imperative that we bolster support for our lower wage workers.</p><p>Mr Zainal co-chairs the tripartite committees to review and enhance the wage and skills ladders in sectors under the PWM today, so that our workers can enjoy better wages and be more productive. These efforts are complemented by the sectoral tripartite partners\\' implementation of the various industry transformation maps, such as in the security and environmental services sectors. These will leverage technology to raise our workers\\' productivity.&nbsp;</p><p>MOM is and will continue to give our fullest support to these important efforts.</p><p>Assoc Prof Walter Theseira said, and I quote, \"the unseen engine behind global cities worldwide is a vast army of essential workers, who are frequently paid too little to live next to those they provide services to\". I fully agree. As a society, we must uplift our lower wage workers and bridge inequality. I believe that our society has matured enough that we would not turn a blind eye to this group of workers, and recognise that they too, should be paid fairly for the essential work that they do. This is the right thing to do. But these efforts will not be able to come to fruition if we do not have the support of the wider community.</p><p>At the end of the day, all of us would have to contribute towards the higher pay for these workers by sharing the rise in cost of products and services.</p><p>The Progressive Wage Models (PWMs) have served us well in supporting our lower wage workers, which includes workers in essential sectors such as cleaning and security. Between 2013 and 2018, the real median monthly gross wages of full-time cleaners, security officers and landscape workers grew cumulatively by 30% or more, which is higher than the 16% for the median full-time income of resident workers. As Member Walter Theseira observed in his Budget speech in February, the PWMs have reversed formerly stagnant wage growth for lower income Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>The vision of PWM was to create occupation, wage and skills ladders across all sectors. This will support our workers to up-skill, raise their productivity and earn higher wages. Given the positive impact of the PWMs, MOM is committed to supporting our tripartite partners\\' efforts to extend PWM to more sectors.</p><p>Earlier this year, we announced that the tripartite partners are extending the PWM to escalator maintenance workers.&nbsp;Members of the community have also voiced their support for essential workers during COVID-19. During my speech at the Committee of Supply debates in March, I painted a vision of how the PWM should be a broader movement where the community can play a part as responsible consumers, even in sectors where mandatory PWM is not possible. In this way, companies that voluntarily pay progressive wages and provide job progression pathways to their workers are recognised and rewarded by consumers who support them by purchasing their goods or services. This will in turn spur more companies to be progressive as the best way to advance their business interests. MOM will share more details when the economic climate and business conditions are more favourable.</p><p>I would like to move on and address Members\\' points on the vulnerability of lower-wage essential workers. Ms Jessica Tan spoke about the need to pay attention to the working conditions as businesses resumed operations, especially for the essential and frontline workers.</p><p>COVID-19 has resulted in significant disruptions to the demand and supply of outsourced services by service buyers and providers. This has in turn affected the livelihoods of workers such as cleaners and security officers.&nbsp;</p><p>The tripartite partners have worked closely to issue tripartite advisories to guide service buyers and providers on how all stakeholders can navigate the situation together to ensure the sustainability of these industries and protect our workers\\' livelihoods. These advisories guide service providers in properly remunerating their workers and urge service buyers to exercise restraint when activating penalty clauses or liquidated damages.&nbsp;This helps ensure that workers are paid appropriately based on their workloads and that their employers have the cashflow to pay them accordingly.</p><p>Service buyers and providers are also encouraged to reallocate manpower based on their priorities. This helps to manage the employees\\' workloads. Finally, employers are also urged to seize the opportunity to up-skill their workers by tapping on Government support, which will prepare them for future challenges and opportunities. By adopting these recommendations, our lower wage essential workers will be protected and employers will be able to tide through this tough period together with them.</p><p>Beyond this, we are also maintaining our efforts to uplift the well-being of our lower wage workers at work through the Workcare initiative. As I shared earlier, we will be launching a new Workcare Grant later this year to support building owners and employers to provide rest areas for outsourced workers&nbsp;– this, with a view to eventually legislating this requirement. Given the importance of their work, it is only right that we promote a culture of care and provide them with the respect they deserve. I would like make a call for everyone to play a part in supporting our lower wage workers and improving their well-being at work – that even small gestures can be meaningful.</p><p>The Government will always look after our lower wage workers through our social schemes. Initiatives such as Workfare supplements their wages, the Enhanced Housing Grant ensures that they have a roof under which their families can grow in stable environments and ComCare provides meaningful social support. We hope that everyone can support us in uplifting our lower wage workers and caring for them in the way they deserve.</p><p>Mr Speaker, I began my speech with how, in every crisis, lies opportunity. We must make every opportunity count. The Government is committed to supporting both our jobseekers and employers to ride out this storm and to emerge stronger. We will help jobseekers seize every available opportunity and employers are encouraged to use this period to build up a skilled workforce so that they are well-positioned for recovery. We can achieve this by working together as Singapore United.</p><p>Mr Speaker, allow me to share a few key points on the Government\\'s support for employers and workers in Malay.&nbsp;</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-5 June 2020 - MOS Zaqy Mohd - Debate on DPM Statement (cred2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>We will support Singaporeans fully. There are many opportunities in growth sectors, so I encourage those who are seeking jobs to be flexible and willing to adapt to access these opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, there are conversion programmes to help you reskill to gain employment in new areas, including the SGUnited Traineeships Programme and the SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme. These programmes can help you to gain industry-relevant work experience and build professional networks.&nbsp;</p><p>We have also introduced measures to help businesses cope during this trying period. I urge employers to be fair and responsible to their workers. Retain your workers, and tap on Government support to help your workers upskill, and at the same time, help your company transform for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, I am greatly heartened to see my fellow Singaporeans and community organisations stepping up to collectively complement the Government’s efforts to help employers and workers during this difficult period. These include the wonderful efforts by our Malay/Muslim community.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the SGTeguhBersatu Taskforce, organisations such as MENDAKI SENSE and the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, or SMCCI, have stepped forward to further strengthen the last-mile delivery of national support measures and lead targeted initiatives to support the Malay/Muslim community on jobs, upskilling and digitalisation for businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>SENSE has organised three Virtual Career Fairs which have attracted close to 12,000 visitors. More than 3,400 people have submitted job applications and the total number of applications received have exceeded 8,000 applications. To date, the CariKerja app has received over 22,000 downloads. These figures indicate a good start.&nbsp;</p><p>SENSE will be scaling up their outreach efforts within the community, including to mature workers, fresh graduates as well as PMET jobseekers.</p><p>For our local businesses, SMCCI, together with technology partners such as Lalamove and Shopback, has helped their members to adopt new solutions that would optimise their businesses in areas such as marketing and e-payments. SMCCI will continue its efforts to conduct more capability development seminars so that our local businesses can make the move to innovate, transform and strengthen their resilience.</p><p>We can expect structural changes to the global and Singapore economy in the long term. As announced by Minister Masagos last week, I will be leading a new workgroup, comprising MENDAKI SENSE, SMCCI, NTUC, organisations from the public sector and community partners to support our Malay/Muslim workers.&nbsp;</p><p>This workgroup will support the efforts of the National Jobs Council, led by Senior Minister Tharman. Collectively, we want to build on the efforts of the SGTeguhBersatu Taskforce, to provide employment support for Malay/Muslim jobseekers, and to better prepare them and improve their employment prospects, by working with our partners and the Government. We will also strengthen our outreach efforts to prepare the community for the future of jobs. This includes mature workers, fresh graduates, the self-employed, and our asatizah.&nbsp;</p><p>We want to help our workers to upskill so that they can stay relevant and subsequently gain employment. With that, they will hopefully have better salary prospects. It is important for the Malay/Muslim community to be ready to seize any opportunities during this crisis and when the economy recovers.</p><p>Our path forward will be tough, but we will journey through it together. The Government will continue to support Singaporeans in adapting to new circumstances. With strong community support, we will work hand-in-hand to help workers and employers seize available opportunities, so that we will emerge stronger as one Singapore. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Pritam Singh</p><h6>2.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>: Mr Speaker, when I spoke on the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets in April, my speech focused on the future. What would happen after the deployment of significant reserves to support lives and livelihoods? I also spoke about how COVID-19 had exposed inequalities&nbsp;– how the wages of some Singaporeans working in essential services need to go up&nbsp;– and what opportunities the COVID-19 crisis had engendered to reimagine a better Singapore.</p><p>For this Fortitude Budget debate, which once again calls for a draw on the reserves, I will focus on three \"E\"s&nbsp;– the economy, engagement and empathy.</p><p>First, the economy.&nbsp;While the central focus of this Budget was jobs, Deputy Prime Minister Heng\\'s speech was instructive in my view for the restatement of three hard truths in the coming months. First, Singapore can expect some tough times ahead. On the day the Deputy Prime Minister delivered this Budget, MTI announced a downward adjustment of our growth forecast of -1% to -4%, to -4% to -7%. Second, the Deputy Prime Minister reminded Singaporeans that life will not return to pre-COVID-19 days, with the global economy unlikely to recover quickly. Finally, the Deputy Prime Minister\\'s speech also reminded Singaporeans, \"that Government cannot carry businesses forever.\"</p><p>On the limit of Government being able to carry business forever, it is clear that companies and businesses will soon have to underwrite their employees\\' wages. This has hitherto been significantly supported by the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS).</p><p>With poor economic growth at the door, some business owners have shared with me that they have retained workers as long as they could, thanks to the JSS, even as other workers were emplaced on no-pay leave and have had to take pay cuts. As JSS expires in time, some retrenchments are inevitable.</p><p>To that end, the goal of the Government to accelerate digitalisation, up-skilling for the future and the creation of a National Jobs Council are steps in the right direction and supported by the Workers\\' Party.&nbsp;These initiatives cohere with an eye on the future and the transformation to a post COVID-19-ready Singapore economy.</p><p>On jobs, Mr Speaker, the headline numbers vis-a-vis initiatives like the new SGUnited Mid-Career Traineeships scheme of 4,000 openings may not appear large next to the size of the Singaporean workforce, but they are an important source of hope for those Singaporeans who have lost their jobs or will lose their jobs.</p><p>Today, some Singaporeans would be downcast at the thought of how to finance or how to continue financing their mortgage and other commitments, or the opportunities they can or cannot provide to their school-going children when their own paychecks have dwindled or, in other cases, evaporated.</p><p>On mid-career workers, I hope the Government considers and incentivises more companies and businesses, through either rebates or reliefs, to offer more of such traineeships and opportunities to mid-career Singaporeans, so that they can learn new skills and embark on new careers.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\"> </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, more than $50 billion has been committed from the Reserves to fight COVID-19 in the matter of a few short months, more than 10 times the amount drawn from the Reserves during the Global Financial Crisis about a decade ago.&nbsp;Unlike the Resilience Budget, I noticed the Fortitude Budget did not include a line to say that the Government would be prepared to make further draws on past Reserves to deal with COVID-19, if necessary. In this regard, the employment of the Contingencies Fund in this Budget answered the question posed during my Resilience Budget debate speech, which queried whether the next Government would have enough fiscal firepower to deal with the effects of the COVID-19 fallout.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Nonetheless, I have a few questions for the Deputy Prime Minister on this count. It would appear that this Contingencies Fund would provide the Government with a significant buffer against post-circuit breaker uncertainties. What is of interest is the decision-making process behind the allocation of this amount. How did the Government settle on it? And on what basis was it justified to the President?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">After delivering the Fortitude Budget, the Deputy Prime Minister was also quoted in the media as saying that Singapore\\'s financial position will be a lot weaker in the coming years. This is a very significant comment on Singapore\\'s fiscal health, the implications of which have not been discussed in public in a significant way thus far. Can the Deputy Prime Minister share more details on his thinking on this matter and what can the public expect in the short and medium term over the next five to 10 years, especially with regard to recurrent taxes and the social contract between people and the state.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">This brings me to my second \"E\" </span>–&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">engagement. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, when the first of four Budgets this year was announced by the Deputy Prime Minister on 28 February, I stated in my speech during the debate that as far as the Workers\\' Party was concerned, politics would take a backseat for a unity of purpose in times of the COVID-19 crisis so that Singapore could&nbsp;single-mindedly overcome this challenge.&nbsp;The Workers\\' Party has not come in to publicly criticise the Government on its handling of an unprecedented crisis in ways that would undermine the national effort. But Singaporeans have a right to expect a thorough review and accounting on the response to this public health crisis. Some, both in and out of this House, have suggested a commission of inquiry or some other independent body to review specific aspects of the Government\\'s response thus far.&nbsp;Whatever the form such a reckoning takes in future, our position, as a constructive Opposition, requires us to communicate the feelings of Singaporeans on the ground in Parliament.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">As we exit the circuit breaker, there is the perception that the Government\\'s handling of the COVID-19 crisis has certainly not included adjectives more commonly associated with the Singapore Government, such as clarity and decisiveness. For example, there is a broadly accepted view that the public should have been told early and clearly, and not through illegal recordings behind closed doors, for example, that universal masking would prove to be a challenge in view of supply constraints requiring the Government to prioritise our healthcare and other essential workers. To this end, straight talk, especially on Singapore\\'s limitations and shortcomings in managing the crisis, did not always define official Government communication on COVID-19.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">There was a perception among some Singaporeans of a public confused with many piecemeal announcements, u-turns and positions that did not gel intuitively, like limiting the number of visits to parents and grandparents to two individuals, when public transport safe distancing rules had already been lifted. Other Members have spoken about the operational frustrations of businesses, like those in construction, and I will not repeat these. This morning, the Straits Times carried a story on COVID-19 regulations comparing hair treatments that go on for hours, contrasted with directives that prohibit beauty treatments that last more than 30 minutes. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">For some Singaporean businesses, at times, it felt as if no one in Government was taking ownership of how COVID-19 directives would be perceived, interpreted and understood on the ground.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Then, they were higher order trade-offs and decisions that could have turned very differently in view of numerous unknowns associated with the spread of the virus. While other countries requisitioned mask supply lines, it would appear that Singapore resisted doing so, probably with an eye on the future so that international companies would always see Singapore as a reliable place to do business. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">This must have been a tough call. But rather than getting the public to speculate about these decision making trade-offs, such as whether the possible shortage of reagents to ramp up COVID-19 testing far more quickly was a problem, the public was largely left to infer positions that ought to have been unequivocally made by the Government.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">For younger Singaporeans, this crisis has been educational and revealing. COVID-19 has reinforced for some Singaporeans, if not exposed for others, especially younger Singaporeans, how reliant Singapore is on foreign sources of manpower and supplies. This is something commentators online would do well to remember when they speak ill or run down our neighbours. Malaysia closed its borders before our circuit breaker, resulting in a difficult adjustment for many Singaporean companies, both public and private, reliant on foreign labour. Can we imagine the psychological impact on Singapore had Malaysia stopped food supplies like vegetables as well?</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Public crisis preparedness, such as a lack of understanding of emergency terminology like DORSCON also revealed gaps that need to be plugged in future. A belated explanation of Singapore having raised its DORSCON level to Orange in 2009 as a result of H1N1, ostensibly to temper panic-buying, and the jolting of memories about the existence of a rice stockpile could not overcome a distinct lack of understanding and preparedness about emergencies amongst many segments of the public. This is unlike the mindset of many Merdeka and Pioneer Generation Singaporeans who would recall emergency preparedness exercises, such as water rationing, for example.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Engaging more Singaporeans on the need to better compensate for, if not overcome, our limitations in key areas and reintroducing public emergency preparedness for psychological resilience, has been exposed by the crisis, and significant focus would need to be placed on this in future.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">To that end, and critically, we must take stock of the entire economy and relook at sectors where greater self-sufficiency and buffer are required, especially essential jobs and services. Such a thorough review could potentially become a source of more job opportunities for Singaporeans, pegged at more respectable wage levels in some cases. I hope this is something the National Jobs Council can look at.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">The last \"E\" I wish to talk about is empathy. We have experienced it in bucket loads over the last two months </span>–<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">&nbsp;a greater acknowledgement of mental health issues; warm cheers of support for healthcare frontliners from HDB flats and condominiums; more stories of Singaporeans offering the Food Panda or Grab delivery person water or a drink before he or she fulfils the next order; and the list goes on.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Singaporeans may have grumbled, but they got on with their lives in spite of the inconveniences of the circuit breaker and played their part in protecting lives and livelihoods. In addition, many younger Singaporeans have taken a great interest in those less well-off. This has been one of the seminal moments of the COVID-19 experience thus far. Volunteering to help distribute food to Singaporeans in need, volunteering to swab foreign workers, delivering laptops to families in need with school-going children, and so much more. In a crisis that this generation of Singaporeans will never forget, we saw the best of Singapore. </span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, being able to put oneself in the shoes of the other is the very definition of empathy.&nbsp;And empathy is a significant source from which fortitude springs and a basis to call upon the cohesion and strength needed for Singapore to overcome challenges and odds. In response to my Resilience Budget speech and, specifically the reference to the New Deal in the US, Deputy Prime Minister Heng cautioned about localising schisms from the US where liberals support comprehensive relief and reform programmes, and conservatives oppose plans that are hostile to growth and business.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">The Deputy Prime Minister would be aware that Singapore is not alien to diametrically opposed ideological perspectives and these have been present in Singapore for some time. The online discourse has, in fact, accentuated it. Another case in point is the recent response of various Chambers of Commerce on the calls made by Singaporeans to moderate the number of foreign workers in Singapore as a result of the COVID-19 experience. With many corporates and big businesses already perceived to be over-represented in our political ecology, be it through the grassroots or through their association in private-public national level committees, the Government needs to consider how it can become a better arbiter between different views, to give and encourage more space to our youths, NGOs unlinked to GLCs and trade unions, and the people sector to voice their contrarian views and perspectives.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">This should be done while retaining a laser-like focus on fact-based conversations that portend a progressive future all Singaporeans can endeavour towards. To this end, we have some Singaporeans, including young ones, wondering whether we had done right by foreign workers, calling for an improvement of their living conditions, but only to be met by naysayers questioning their motives. In fact, COVID-19 has, paradoxically, vindicated a smaller group of Singaporeans who have been lobbying for improvements to foreign worker management policies for years.&nbsp;To that end, the Government\\'s decision to quickly introduce guidelines for better foreign worker accommodation standards and the promotion of a more respectful culture between Singaporeans and migrant workers has been a very positive development.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">In my view, Mr Speaker, we should count ourselves fortunate that we have citizens who are the loving critics amongst us, some of whom have been questioned in this very House in this term of Government. Members would recall one citizen\\'s poems were nitpicked with a view to cast wholly negative aspersions on his character, even though that individual was not present in the House to defend himself.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Mr Speaker, when any leader or person of influence engages in what will be interpreted as dog-whistling, it sets the tone for how members of the public debate with those whose views they disagree with.&nbsp;If binary black-and-white perspectives are the shape of how we as a society deal with differences after COVID-19, Singapore will become an ordinary society, no different from many around the world. But nobody expects the Government to willy-nilly change its decision at the first sign of pressure and agree with a critic. Singaporeans do recognise the multitude of perspectives the Government has to take cognisance of, but it is important to recognise and not forget that citizens criticise and even organise, because they care.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">Moving forward, the Government should look at opening more avenues like Parliament for citizen engagement, greater data sharing and empower other institutions like our think-tanks, and nudge the mainstream media to give alternative perspectives more voice and even provide platforms piloting change on a small scale. As we traverse the post-COVID-19 volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world, we need to place more faith and promote even greater participation from Singaporeans than ever before.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">In conclusion, Mr Speaker, COVID-19 has prompted many Singaporeans to ask fundamental questions about our economy and who we are as a people. As many Singaporeans will have to buckle down to take on new skills and jobs, COVID-19 has also provided an opportunity for Singaporeans to take a deeper interest in their country and their society.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">This is a positive development, even as COVID-19 has hit Singapore while we contend with other pressing short and medium term issues, such as demographic shifts, technological disruption, climate change and, more ominously, the impact to our position as a global Asia hub from US-China competition and rivalry.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">The economic picture may be bleak today and, for some, a moment of anguish. But as I had put forth in my response to the Resilience Budget, there are opportunities to reset some fundamental assumptions about the type of society we can endeavour and pivot towards. I use the word \"pivot\" because Singapore is a far more complex and varied economy and society than it was in 1965. The transition will demand everyone\\'s participation, effort and energies.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(74, 74, 74);\">But with the people determined and committed to the nation\\'s recovery and success, COVID-19 is a golden opportunity for this generation to envision and build a better Singapore. Mr Speaker, I support the Fortitude Budget.</span></p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Denise Phua.</p><h6>2.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, four Budgets in less than four months. Kudos to the Government and especially the MOF team who stitched the Budgets together.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more disruption than one can imagine – changing lives and livelihoods as we knew them to be. Economic activities have plummeted, the depth and speed of which rival that of the Great Depression.&nbsp;Experts worldwide cannot agree on how long the downturn will be. There is no telling what the recovery is going to look like – V-curve, U-curve, Z-curve, a smooth bounce-back, a slow-burn recovery or worse still, a relapse.</p><p>One of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\\'s favourite quotes during this season is by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill who said this, \"Now, this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is perhaps, the end of the beginning\". Indeed, change has only begun even as Singapore exits from the circuit breaker. Many people, businesses and individuals, understandably are very concerned about how this recovery will look like.&nbsp;I therefore seek Deputy Prime Minister and MOF\\'s reading of the pace of recovery and what the overall strategy would look like in the best case scenario and in the worst case scenario.</p><p>I want to move next to touch on two things. One, on the small and medium enterprises or SMEs; and two, on charities, the social service sector and the disabled.</p><p>First, on the SMEs. We all know that the SMEs form an integral part of Singapore\\'s economic landscape, embodying the spirit of entrepreneurship of our nation and employing more than two-thirds<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">&nbsp;of our local workforce. I applaud the Singapore Government\\'s and especially MTI\\'s relentless efforts in supporting them, even before the pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p><p>SMEs with a headstart and stronger technological capabilities are likely to recover faster from the pandemic. The prognosis of the rest of the economy will be uncertain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A survey of 48 merchant associations representing almost 500 merchants was conducted in May 2020 by the Federation of Merchant Association Singapore\\'s heartland enterprises unit. When the merchants were asked what challenges they face in joining the e-commerce wagon, as they put it, about half of the respondents quoted these two top challenges: one, the lack of their own internal capabilities to sustain the digitalisation efforts; and two, the cost of implementation and the recurring costs of digitalisation. Capabilities and cost, not only during adoption, but also in sustaining the efforts, remain their top concerns.</p><p>So, using a simple segmentation based on one\\'s willingness to change and two, the ability to change, there appears to be four groups of SMEs.</p><p>The first group: those who are willing and able to change. I think they will benefit most from Government schemes and they include the early adopters and the high-potential start-ups that are targeted in the Budget. How will we facilitate this group more to help them scale further and to open more doors for and with them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Group two: those who are able to change and not willing to change. How do we convince and incentivise them so more of them will come on board?</p><p>Group three: those who are not able to change and not willing to change. I think we have no choice but to let them exit. But how will we, considering that they are also Singapore SMEs, how will we help them exit with a softer landing?</p><p>The last group, which is likely the largest, those who are willing to change but not able to change for various reasons. This is the largest group for which the strategy has to be training and coaching. Sir, it is not enough just to convert them. There is a need, a real need to make them not just \"apprentices\" and also \"disciples\" so that more of them can sustain digitalisation efforts and continue to be successful as we emerge from the crisis.</p><p>Is there some way by which we can invest and handhold them longer and deeper? Pair them perhaps with not just simply Digitalisation Ambassadors, but Digitalisation Coaches who can equip them with more and deeper operational and systemic skills and knowledge in such areas like backend stock inventory management, customer fulfilment, digital marketing skills and so forth.</p><p>And finally, for those who eventually have to cease operations but nonetheless have the acumen and energy to continue, can there be, for the SMEs, an equivalent of a \"professional-conversion\" scheme, just like what we have for individuals, a placement scheme, to help them seize&nbsp;business or job opportunities in sectors that are more in the sunrise spaces like urban farming, logistics, warehousing, healthcare, estate maintenance and so forth?&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I want to move from business to the charities, social service sector and the disabled.</p><p>Sir, like the SMEs in Singapore\\'s economic landscape, many charities and social service agencies or SSAs form an integral part of Singapore\\'s social service landscape. The services range from serving the elderly to the young, families, they operate in nursing homes, day activity centres, family service centres, early intervention to special education schools.</p><p>I thank Deputy Prime Minister Heng for acknowledging the importance of SSAs and charities as, \"key partners\", especially in this period. Deputy Prime Minister shared that in the years ahead, a \"stronger social service sector will be even more critical\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I want to also thank Deputy Prime Minister for including the charities and SSAs in the Fortitude Budget in many schemes, such as Job Support Scheme and the Enhanced Fundraising Programme to match donations up to $250,000 per charity. These are all appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>I have several suggestions for consideration by Government for this sector and for the people served by the sector.&nbsp;</p><p>Suggestion one: raise the cap of $250,000 in the Enhanced Fundraising Programme for larger charities. Sir, the larger charities run into tens and hundreds of millions of dollars in budget. They run community hospitals and disability centres. And fundraising provides a substantial top up to Government grants and subsidies for them. For such a time as this, fundraising is expectedly very challenging. It is hence useful for Government to consider raising the matching amount in order to incentivise more donors to invest now, rather than later or never.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Suggestion two: for this sector is to target high needs areas. There are groups with high support needs which call for more attention and resourcing so that they are not left behind. Some are the more severely disabled groups, such as beneficiaries in the autism day activity centres where we serve the more severe ones, residential homes, such as that run by St Andrew\\'s, families with rare disorders are kids with rare disorders and multiple disabilities and lower income households sandwiched by elderly and younger disabled. Target high needs areas.</p><p>Suggestion three: can we include more blatantly, more explicitly and visibly charities and the social service sector in the transformation masterplan of Singapore? Transformation of a nation is needed&nbsp;– not just in the business sector but also in the not-for-profit sector.&nbsp;Many of the push for digitalisation, innovation and entrepreneurship in business are relevant to the people sector. The willing amongst them, like the SMEs, require not only just Digital Ambassadors but also digital coaches and partners. Charities with high potential and good track records, should be facilitated and governed with a lighter touch. Let them thrive, let them push the boundaries to greater heights and support them in their transformation.&nbsp;</p><p>Suggestion four: include vulnerable groups such as the disabled right at the start of planning in all of the good things: the digitalistion, jobs and skills upgrading movement, including and not limited to the exciting plans for the new National Jobs Council, SG-United Jobs and Traineeship and SkillsFuture efforts. In fact, adopt the principle of what is commonly known now as universal design and design for all, right at the start. BCA and MND have already done so in the design of buildings and the physical built environment. The same should be applied in other areas as well in the protection and creation of jobs an skills upgrading. So, that is four&nbsp;– include the people sector including&nbsp;the vulnerable, the disabled; right at the start in the planning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And suggestion five: the last one for this group, is to start a disability chapter in the National Jobs Council.&nbsp;It is no secret that jobs are already hard to come by for persons with disabilities during normal times. Commissioned by MSF Minister, Mr Desmond Lee, a workgroup that is led by Minister of State Sam Tan and myself is working on the underlying factors for this issue and a report will be published by the end of the year. The COVID-19 outbreak, however, adds urgency to the challenges faced by the disability community especially in the areas of digitalisation and jobs. I therefore urge Deputy Prime Minister and Minster for Finance Heng and Senior Minister Tharman to set up a chapter in the National Jobs Council for the employability training and employment for the disabled so that they will not fall further behind.</p><p>In conclusion, Sir, on the lost, least and last in society.</p><p>Sir, this battle against our common enemy, COVID-19, can only be truly won if we include whom some in our society perceive as the lost, least and the last amongst us. Let us not give up easily on those who are willing to change but not able to change for some reasons, whether they are SMEs, social service agencies, our elderly, our disabled or others who are vulnerable in our Singapore family. They say it takes a globe to fight this pandemic. And indeed, the globe includes us and it starts with each one of us.</p><p>Once again, I quote Winston Churchill who said, \"These are not dark days these are great days... we must all thank God that we have been allowed, each of us according to our stations to play a part in making these days memorable in the history of our race.\"&nbsp;</p><p>And I want to end off with a quote by our founding father of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, of whom I know Deputy Prime Minister Heng is a great fan. Mr Lee Kuan Yew said this during the post SARS period, in his experience \"in any battle, the morale and the spirit of the people will decide the outcome. I never believed we would fail\".</p><p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew knew at that time it was going to be tough, like climbing up the face of a cliff. But we, like he said, \"must have the guts and determination to climb the face of the cliff and we will climb up the face of the cliff!\" And if I might add, with fortitude and not just the hindsight vision of 20-20.</p><p>Sir, we can only be #strongertogether. I support the Fortitude Budget wholeheartedly.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Ms Yip Pin Xiu.</p><h6>2.43 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Yip Pin Xiu (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Speaker, last week when Deputy Prime Minister delivered the Fortitude Budget, I had a moment of relief, as did many Singaporeans, to hear that the Government is helping to keep jobs and giving more support to businesses that might be struggling. The relief for sectors hit hardest and businesses still unable to open is very much welcomed. It has been months of hard work by the Government. Thank you for your dedication and to Singaporeans for playing their part.</p><p>Many businesses are affected during this period, with many unsure of their future.</p><p>This COVID-19 pandemic is causing unparalleled uncertainty across many fronts. One industry that I am immersed in is the sports and fitness industry. With the reliefs, businesses may have less worries for the next month or so but with the uncertainty of when they can resume operations due to safe distancing measures, or when Singaporeans will come back to sports due to their own personal concerns of safety, it is difficult for them to plan for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>This industry is having a tough time. Most sports and fitness activities stopped even before the circuit breaker started as there were already other measures in place to flatten the curve at that point of time. Most gyms and studios have frozen or adjusted their memberships to retain clients, while some are conducting online classes. Planned events from competitions to fundraising events have been cancelled. All these had led to significant revenue loss across the sector.</p><p>These are businesses that keep our society healthy and resilient and the COVID-19 pandemic is putting them at a risk. Sports and fitness helps to build a stronger national identity. It improves our health, productivity, reduces medical expenses and enhances social cohesion. Sports and fitness are for people of all ages, abilities and walks of life.</p><p>More importantly, the Sports and Fitness industry is one of the industries that has a huge knock-on effect to the rest of the economy since the Sports and Fitness industry is not just about people exercising or playing games&nbsp;– it also involves many other sectors and businesses such as tourism, retail, events management, marketing, sports education and training, support services such as Public Relations, fundraising and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>I understand that we must now proceed with caution as we slowly emerge after two months of circuit breaker measures and I wholeheartedly agree with it. We do not want our efforts to go to waste. We must all still do our part.&nbsp;</p><p>The current JSS scheme supports businesses that are unable to resume when a circuit breaker ends, with 75% of monthly wages till August or until they open. When a Sports and Fitness industry opens. Again, it will receive 25% of Monday wages being in JSS Tier 3. However, there will be many safe distancing measures in placed. For example, only being able to have one person per swimming lane or the spacing between each individual has to be huge, hence, only accommodating six people in the studio at all times. This cut in numbers will result in a low income coming in. The Sports and Fitness industry is finding it difficult to survive. Now, as they already had to dig in the reserves for the past two months or so. Besides paying their employees who may have already taken a pay cut, there are also other expenses. If unable to cope, these schools and clubs might start closing down and it will affect our pipeline as the schools and clubs are an important pathway for our sporting performance.</p><p>Right now, what will be helpful is if we have a clearer view. When Phase Two comes, outdoor sporting facilities can open again. Sports and Fitness is a highly varied industry, with many different kinds of activities&nbsp;– from outdoor sports, to personal training sessions, to tennis where players stand on opposing ends of the court, to swimming, to indoor activities such as yoga and kickboxing.</p><p>There are questions that many businesses are asking&nbsp;– when the numbers remain low, what will the plan be? What about indoor facilities and when these facilities can start again, what will the most number of people be allowed in at any point in time? These details will help this industry be more certain and help the industry chart the path ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>With all the positives that this industry brings to Singaporeans, we still want to see them around after the COVID-19 pandemic so that they can continue contributing positively to the community. If we continue doing our parts to keep each other safe, we can look forward to getting back into sporting activities safely. The rest of the services associated with the Sports and Fitness industry that I had highlighted above would also be able to better plan their respective businesses and know how to react to the new norms when the time comes. We will all have to adapt to a new kind of normal, to include safe distancing measures and ensure we come out of this stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>We talk about digitising in times like this. However, the Sports and Fitness industry is one of the sectors that is harder to digitise, as its very essence is to get people to go out and be active, healthy and interact socially. Yes, payments can be done online, some activities can shift online but It will be hard to do things like instructions online especially for our younger, older and special population groups that require a greater level of supervision. Certain activities that require a physical medium like swimming, will also lose out, because, say for example, why would parents want their children to do land activities online for swimming classes when they can take up a land sport instead? Some businesses need more help than digitising.</p><p>For those that can find a way to digitise, the Enterprise Innovation and Capability Development Grant was announced a week ago. This grant supports businesses that can come out with innovative and smart solutions within the sport industry. We eagerly await the application instructions.</p><p>More importantly, this is also a great opportunity for the Government to take a more holistic approach in improving the entire industry and provide the infrastructural approach and guidance to help the industry grow. This could be done by taking a more inclusive approach in education and towards the sporting enterprises, to help them grow together with this economy.</p><p>More emphasis needs to be placed on sports in Singapore. Starting from our schools. We must create an environment where sports is a bigger part of the curriculum from kindergarten all the way through Junior College and Polytechnic. Sports is nowhere near the top of our priority list, but what we learn from sports will also play a big part in our education. Institutions should embrace sporting values into their own culture. When we adequately and holistically impart the fun and advantages of sport in them at a young age, it helps to translate into lifelong participation in sports.</p><p>Personally, being actively involved in sports since a young age has helped me greatly. My parents saw the value in sports. It has not only helped me physically but also mentally and emotionally. When I was younger, I was not a very good student. I did not get good grades, but after winning a gold medal at the Paralympics in Beijing, I came back and did my \"O\" levels. I did not hit my expectations but thankfully I managed to get into Polytechnic. Then, I thought to myself, why not use the perseverance, grit, focus and everything I learnt from swimming to apply to my studies? I was then laser focused on getting my grades up and started to do pretty well and eventually got into SMU. If not for swimming, I would not be where i am today.&nbsp;</p><p>When kids start participating more in sports, their families watch them play and that helps with family bonding. This leads to a more supportive family and community. Parents are our first sport coaches and they impart&nbsp;social and family values through play. Similarly, as we age, other important values can be imparted through sports.</p><p>For the sporting industry to be sustainable in Singapore, we must create a stronger industry with more opportunities. For our sporting culture to grow, the Sports and Fitness industry must grow too. Sport Singapore has done a commendable job with Active SG, Singapore Sports Institute, Sports Cares and more. We have amazing facilities and host world class events.&nbsp;We must continue our efforts and continue to improve by growing the sports industry.</p><p>As a regulator, an approach would be to work closer with the private sector to enhance capabilities, resources and business opportunities.&nbsp;Sports and fitness businesses are an important pillar of this industry as they bring expertise, knowledge and organised play to the table.&nbsp;They employ passionate Singaporeans that are constantly shaping the lives of people of all ages and backgrounds. And we need them to thrive so as to achieve the outcomes I spoke about earlier.</p><p>One of the ways is to provide them access to the many facilities that we have developed over the years. We have many facilities that are largely reserved for use only by the public sector.&nbsp;Opening up access would create more opportunities for the industry to grow.</p><p>More importantly, to build sustainability, we also need to accelerate the growth of businesses who have great potential. For these companies, we could offer support for growth, examples include upskilling of workforce, hiring of middle aged educators who are looking for a career switch, support for programme or curriculum development and support for new market development.&nbsp;</p><p>Another approach is to take a more inclusionary path in organising the Sports and Fitness industry.&nbsp;SportSG as a regulator has done a fantastic job with its various initiatives to get people to participate in sports. However, the impact may be greater and faster, if we allow the Sports and Fitness industry operators to help in this process. One of the ways we could do this is to allow the Sports and Fitness industry to fill in the gaps and allow them to grow, rather than to take a one size fits all approach. In the long run, we will have a more vibrant, sustainable sporting Singapore.</p><p>Mr Speaker, the next group of people that I will be speaking for, are some people that tend to be left behind because they have more specific circumstances and needs that you might not think about unless you were in their shoes. In this period of time, how many Singaporeans have thought about how somebody who is blind and living alone while observing safe distancing measures is coping? If a student with muscular dystrophy needs an oxygen tank with a breathing mask and their teacher asks them to put on a face mask or shield, which would mean that they have to take the oxygen tank off, so that the teacher does not get into trouble for not observing the measures. How would this affect the student and their family?&nbsp;</p><p>In times like this, it is especially crucial to look out for those who may be struggling more than others. I recognise that SGEnable and Social Service Agency partners are helping people with special needs and the vulnerable in the community. I see the C.A.R.E initiative by Mediacorp Enable Fund aiming to help people with disabilities and their care-givers ride out the COVID-19 pandemic as the impact on this community has been, in their words \"disproportionately huge\". This fund is driven by public donations and we greatly appreciate that. Together, we can all continue playing a part to ensure no one falls through the cracks.&nbsp;</p><p>The lack of information to certain disability groups in Singapore is counter-productive to the effort in combating the COVID-19 outbreak. The right to information is crucial for ensuring public awareness, trust and fighting misinformation.</p><p>We have to ensure that public health information and communication is accessible on all important media publications. It would be ideal if a Singapore Sign Language interpreter is present for all live, recorded events and communications. This includes national addresses, press briefings and live social media. I am happy to see that the Budget speech last week included Singapore Sign Language and live notes. Over the weekend, I was watching a live panel discussion on social media – Get Active TV that featured Minister Fu and SportSG. They too had a Singapore Sign Language interpreter and live notes. I am very heartened at this great development and hopefully this can continue on all other updates and media during this time and beyond. We look forward to a time when all media comes with live Singapore Sign Language interpretation. This is important because that is the first language for many people who are deaf.&nbsp;</p><p>We need public materials that can be converted into \"Easy Read\" format so that they can be accessible for people with cognitive impairment. We need to develop accessible written information products by using appropriate document formats with structured headings, large print, braille versions and formats for people who are deafblind or visually impaired. The images we put out out there have to be inclusive and enable the independence of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs).&nbsp;For example, the current level of safe entry QR code tends to be placed a bit too high. A consideration could be to place it at varying easy to reach heights as we have done so with many lift buttons.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, supermarkets have done a great job at dealing with the increased demand and restocking of shelves. The priority shopping hour for vulnerable groups is a great start and we hope that persons with all disabilities can access this, including those with invisible disabilities. Some PWDs find it difficult to go to supermarkets because they are staying at home&nbsp;due to having compromised immune systems. Hence, other than a priority shopping hour, introducing priority delivery slots will also help. Many PWDs are finding it hard to get deliveries. This may be a combination of there not being enough slots as well as the accessibility of websites not being optimal.</p><p>Other than food, access to medical prescriptions and other health care supplies are highly essential as well. Existing volunteer networks can be activated to help deliver these supplies. If possible, doctors should be able to see their at-risk patients online for check ups because they are afraid of going to hospitals to get exposed yet they do need to see the doctor for their regular check up.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides medications, some disabilities require more home care and physiotherapy services. These services cannot be stopped as it will bring detrimental results mentally and physically to PWDs and their family. In some cases, not getting their physiotherapy will result in irreversible loss of muscle or contracture which will permanently impact their quality of life. In just two weeks\\' time, they would have permanently lost quite a bit of function.&nbsp;</p><p>Employment of persons with disabilities remains relatively low in Singapore and for those that are employed, not all are fortunate enough to be able to execute their work from home. The main issues for PWDs working from home are whether their employers can adequately physically and financially provide the assistive devices and technology they may need to work at home. Many themselves are not able to do so because of their socio-economic challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>For PWDs whose job scope used to be done predominantly face-to-face, the added need for technology to be able to potentially do the work online would mean increased spending. While there is an existing Assistive Technology Fund for Persons with Disabilities, it is a reimbursement fund tied to means testing and the reimbursement can also take up to three weeks which may not be a feasible option for those who are struggling financially. Schemes such as NEU PC to provide laptops to students from low-income families are welcome. However, assistive technology and aids are usually more expensive to purchase.&nbsp;This translates to a loss of income and opportunities to retrain or learn new skills.</p><p>Socially, the lack of access to IT equipment can mean missing out on opportunities to maintain or grow connections with friends and families. This can in turn negatively impact those with psycho-social disabilities, increasing mental stress and straining existing coping mechanisms.&nbsp;</p><p>As we are encouraged to work from home or have home-based learning, what assistance is being provided to ensure that the assistive technology is available in all homes for persons with disabilities? Many of them face socio-economic challenges and may not be able to afford IT equipment, assistive aids and broadband to help them better cope with life in this period of time.&nbsp;</p><p>Persons with disabilities who had jobs that cannot be done online or had difficulties finding employment before the COVID-19 pandemic are even more concerned that they will not be able to return to work or get a job. They are also concerned about the accessibility or inclusivity of job training and retraining programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>The financial assistance provided by the Temporary Relief fund, COVID-19 Support Grant and other schemes such as SIRS are greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>Those with disabilities already often have higher healthcare and personal care costs and these costs are likely to increase as alternative or emergency arrangements are made during the circuit breaker or the phases after that. In addition, some PWDs rely on informal and temporary work arrangements and as such, do not strictly fit into the eligibility requirements of SIRS.</p><p>Taking that into consideration, can the Government consider extending the amount that is given and the duration of the relief for persons with disabilities or increasing the eligibility to those with higher household incomes?</p><p>Lastly, it is important to have a disability touch point for the COVID-19 response. Having a touch point within the Government or related agencies where persons with disabilities, their care-givers and organisations can feedback on the accessibility of COVID-19 response information and measures is key. We need a fast response as a delay might cause harm to some individuals in special situations. This touch point ensures that there is two-way communication about the COVID-19 response and we can identify the gaps quickly and share best practices. The best way to find out what people need is to ask them.</p><p>In this pandemic, we have to look out for all so that we can truly be an inclusive and united Singapore. I support the Budget.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chee Hong Tat, I believe you have a clarification.</p><h6>3.03 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Chee Hong Tat)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I would like to clarify a point that Mr Pritam Singh made in his speech earlier regarding public communication on the use of masks.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, since late January this year, during the initial period when the virus first emerged in Singapore and even before the virus was called COVID-19, the Government had already started explaining publicly our position on masks. We explained to the public that there were supply constraints globally and some economies have in fact banned the export of masks. We then called on Singaporeans that we have to use masks appropriately. Please do not hoard so that we will have enough supplies, especially for those groups that need them most.</p><p>Sir, what I have just said are based on media reports and information that can be found in the public domain.</p><p>Sir, this Government has always been open and transparent with Singaporeans in our explanation and in our communications. When there is new information, there is new evidence, we would likewise adopt an open and transparent manner in our communications because we know that is important in our collective fight against this pandemic.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Singh.</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>: Mr Speaker, I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State for that clarification. In that vein, can I ask the Senior Minister of State, with regard to the decision earlier this week to stop usage of face shields except for certain classes of individuals, how was that decision originally taken to allow for face shields and then, a u-turn made thereafter to limit it to specific classes? How did that information change from the health experts I imagine that the Government has access to?</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, I think the Multi-Ministry Task Force or MTF has explained why there was a change in the advisory on the use of face shields. This is as Mr Singh himself alluded to&nbsp;– based on the advice from medical professionals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Pritam Singh</strong>: I understand that, Senior Minister of State. Can I ask what were the reasons given by those experts for that change?</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, I am not a doctor, so I am not equipped to provide the medical reasons to answer Mr Singh\\'s question in detail&nbsp;—</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Gan would like to elaborate.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: But I think the MTF and the medical professionals have provided the explanation. It is about safety. It is about protecting everybody\\'s health and safety.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Minister Gan Kim Yong.</p><p><strong>The Minister for Health (Mr Gan Kim Yong)</strong>: Mr Speaker, perhaps I could assist in explaining the rationale behind that. As we move into Phase One of our opening, we will see increased interaction within the community, among people. And therefore, we will have to make sure that additional safeguards are put in place. Given that face shields do not provide a full coverage of your face, your nose and your mouth because there are gaps between the shield and your face, it poses certain risks.&nbsp;</p><p>These risks are less of a concern during the circuit breaker period when most people are asked to stay home. Therefore, we allowed face shields to be used. But when we open up the community and the economy, we expect more interaction and therefore, we need to enhance the protection where possible. Therefore, we encouraged people to use the full-face mask instead of a face shield.</p><p>But we still allow face shields to be used in specific situations where mask-wearing is not practical.&nbsp;One example which we gave was during teaching. Teachers need to make sure that their teaching is clearly heard and it is important for them to see and to interact with the children. We have therefore allowed face shields to be used for teaching. But in other circumstances, we will require a mask to be used.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Chee.</p><p><strong>Mr Chee Hong Tat</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to reiterate the reason for my clarification in the first place was to highlight that the Government has been open and transparent in our communications on the use of masks since the beginning&nbsp;– since the late January period when the virus first emerged in Singapore. I think that is really my key point&nbsp;– that we have publicly explained that and these are all in the public domain.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Darryl David.</p><h6>3.10 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, the measures introduced in our four Budgets thus far have been designed to provide short-term measures and immediate relief to save businesses and preserve livelihoods and jobs, as well as to accelerate the long-term transformation of Singapore\\'s socio-economic framework and foundations, so that we, as a country, can emerge stronger from this crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While there has been a&nbsp;comprehensive range of schemes and measures rolled out, I would like to focus on a few key areas in my speech.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has seen the Government take bold, unprecedented steps to help our businesses stay afloat. As most of us know, two of the biggest overheads that businesses must manage are manpower costs and rent. To support manpower cost and to save jobs, the Government has introduced the Jobs Support Scheme and either waived or provided rebates on manpower levies.&nbsp;</p><p>To help companies manage rental cost, the Government first introduced several measures such as rebate on property tax and waiver of rental for tenants of Government properties.</p><p>More significantly, this is now being reinforced with proposed legislation to mandate commercial landlords to grant rental waivers to their SME tenants who have suffered a reduction in businesses due to COVID-19. This is rare in Singapore\\'s context as the Government does not usually&nbsp;engage in direct intervention of the market, especially in private business arrangements. But this is not a common crisis and this uncommon step of intervening demonstrates the commitment of the Government to help SMEs weather through the storm.&nbsp;</p><p>I am in firm support of this and while&nbsp;this is a positive boost for SME tenants, there is also the possibility that a significant number of smaller landlords could themselves be small companies or even individual owners who are dependent on this rental income to meet their income needs and financial commitments. Waiving the rental income for their tenants might thus result in them being deprived of revenue or even being slapped with penalties from financial institutions because they are unable to service their loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What help and support would the Government be able to provide smaller landlords in such situations?&nbsp;And if these smaller landlords are unable to fulfill their financial obligations, would the Government be able to intervene to mandate that financial institutions perhaps could suspend loan repayments until this group of landlords are able to start collecting their rental income?</p><p>I would like to move on now, Mr Speaker, Sir, to helping workers and those who have lost their jobs.</p><p>Despite all the measures that we have put in place to support companies through COVID-19, not all companies will survive the downturn and the global economic slowdown. Retrenchment is thus imminently unavoidable. It is heartening to know that one of the major thrusts of the main and supplementary Budgets is to preserve jobs and a new National Jobs Council will be set up to look at job creation and the deep skilling of workers.&nbsp;</p><p>COVID-19 has transformed the way we think about work. In many countries, what was traditionally known as \"3D jobs\" – dirty, dangerous and demeaning – are now considered as important services that keep countries going, that keep communities going. Frontline jobs that were not given much attention in the past are now being recognised as being operationally essential.&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore is no exception. COVID-19, indeed, has created some jobs that were unheard of prior to the pandemic. In January this year, we would have no clue what a Safe Distancing Ambassador, a test swabber, a swab assistant or a temperature taker was. But they have now entered the lexicon of our everyday use&nbsp;– in terms of the language that we use. Indeed, as reported&nbsp;in the media this week, we will soon have Digital Ambassadors to help hawkers and senior citizens to learn digital skills.&nbsp;</p><p>These jobs were clearly created out of the need to manage the challenges of COVID-19 and also help provide part-time employment to those who were made redundant by the crisis.&nbsp;In the mid term, certain jobs like Safe Distancing Ambassadors will continue to be relevant but in the long run, some of these&nbsp;jobs could be less necessary as we internalise the need to practise safe distancing, when a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available or as we level up on the digital front.</p><p>To ensure that this precious workforce does not become redundant when these semi-permanent positions are no longer required, how can we future-proof the career paths of currently employed Singaporeans and to help our people retrain, up-skill and continue to pivot and shapeshift, as it were, to stay relevant as we respond to the new normal.</p><p>I sincerely hope that this is something that the National Jobs Council will need to consider as it balances short-term national needs with the long-term prospects for our people.</p><p>The next topic, Mr Speaker, Sir, is on digitalisation and education.</p><p>In the early days of COVID-19, there was a meme circulating that the virus was more effective than CEOs and CTOs in pushing for digital transformation. This meme turned out to be quite prophetic and in the past few months, we have seen companies accelerating digital implementation and making remote work platforms mainstream in somewhat record time.&nbsp;</p><p>The same could be said about our schools. Since the start of the circuit breaker, school-going children across all age groups have adopted home-based learning. It was reported that more than 96% of students are participating in it. On the one hand, this figure is encouraging as it shows that our children have adapted well to learning on digital&nbsp;channels. Yet, on the other hand, it was reported that MOE had to loan out thousands of computing devices and internet dongles to families. These figures suggest that there is a gap in accessibility to digital learning.&nbsp;</p><p>It is heartening to know that MOE intends to accelerate the ownership of digital learning devices for all Secondary school children from their initial date of 2028.</p><p>However, I would like to clarify if there are similar plans to accelerate the ownership of these devices for children from other levels of study – so not just Secondary school students and above, but perhaps for Primary school students. And more critically, if there are, will this device be purchased off-the-shelf and supplied by different tech companies or will it be a proprietary device uniquely designed and manufactured by MOE for our schools and for our school children?</p><p>I am strongly advocating for the latter, Mr Speaker. In addition to have the opportunity for Singapore businesses to benefit from both hardware production and software development, the benefits to our children will be myriad.&nbsp;</p><p>With more control over the design and functionality of this device, this all-in-one custom-designed learning device could function as a lap-top, a tablet, an e-text book, and a communication tool. A veritable digital \"Swiss-Army Education Knife\" of sorts.</p><p>The ownership of this multi-function device might also eliminate the need for piles of back-breaking, physical textbooks year after year after year. Going to school in the future could be as easy as just bringing along this device and all forms of learning and work submission can be done digitally on a unified platform. Quite literally, we are putting the world in the hands of our school children. The software could be customised and adapted to suit the pace of learning for different children while also providing personal insights to how each student engages and interacts along the learning journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I envisage the schools of the future to be one where students would do everything off this device.&nbsp;The operating system of this device could function like an enhanced version of the MOE\\'s present Student Learning System (SLS) and would allow for more coordinated and unified communication and work planning. This would meet the twin goals of being environmentally friendly while also taking a huge step towards being a digital smart nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We could tier the ownership cost of the device depending on varying household incomes, with the aim that no school-going child should be deprived of their own personal learning device. No school-going child should be deprived of their own personal learning device.&nbsp;This would give our children, especially those from lower income background, a sense of pride and ownership that they have their own personal device that will allow them to navigate the same digital and virtual education landscapes as their peers. The deliberately neutral branding also encourages status equality, not to mention standard software and hardware upgrades that will leave no child lacking.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I know that this might seem like an audaciously ambitious idea, but aiming high and overachieving is something that Singapore has always done. So, I urge the MOE to give this idea a serious thought and I look forward to the day that not only can we ensure that every student – every student is provided with their own personal Smart Learning device, but we can take pride that this device was designed and produced by our MOE, specially for our children.&nbsp;Singapore could very well be the first nation in the world to achieve our vision of \"smart learning.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, 2020 will no doubt go down in memory as one of the most volatile years the world, and Singapore, has experienced. Yet in every crisis, lie opportunities to innovate and transform and the past 100 days have certainly seen our companies and schools doing just that, as they have experimented and innovated with new methods of doing business and conducting lessons.&nbsp;</p><p>As Singaporeans, we are a resilient people.&nbsp;And we can be masters of our own destiny and forge our own uniquely Singaporean path through this crisis. With the Government playing a pivotal role and strengthening its commitment to the people, I am certain that we will emerge as a stronger and more cohesive society after COVID-19. I thus conclude my speech in firm support of the Fortitude Budget.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Minister Desmond Lee.</p><h6>3.20 pm</h6><p><strong>The Second Minister for National Development (Mr Desmond Lee)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, COVID-19 has disrupted all sectors of the economy including construction. During the circuit breaker period, most construction work was suspended. Post circuit breaker, contractors are anxious to resume work quickly. Many have paid for material or are leasing equipment which are now sitting idle and since contractors are typically paid based on progress payments, no work means no payment; and we understand then anxiety.</p><p>While we want to resume construction activity quickly, it is equally important that we do so safely.&nbsp;The vast majority of our COVID-19 cases have been amongst construction workers. So, we do not want to restart hastily as a new case could easily cause another outbreak or new cluster among construction workers either on a construction site or in the dormitories.</p><p>Such a resurgence of infection would not only endanger the health of our workers and the wider community, but also bring the construction industry to a halt to get. This is not in anyone\\'s interest.&nbsp;It is in our common interest for construction work to resume in a phased and controlled manner.</p><p>We had the first tranche of projects which could not be left idle for long because of safety reasons. These have been allowed to restart from 2 June.&nbsp;Beyond this list of projects if firms have cleared workers and have put in place necessary safe management measures, firms can submit their applications to BCA and once approved they will be able to resume their projects.</p><p>On the Government end, my colleagues have been working hard on multiple fronts to allow construction activities to resume faster.</p><p>First, the inter-agency Task Force has been systematically and progressively clearing workers living in dormitories to ensure they are well so that they can return to work.&nbsp;Many contractors have shared with us their frustration about not knowing what is going on in the dormitories, as workers have been moved around several times during these few months. They would also like to know in advance when their workers can be tested and cleared for work so they can make plans for the projects to resume. They have asked for more information and updates on the dormitories\\' clearance situation.</p><p>Members would recognise the scale and complexity of the Task Force operations as there are 43 purpose-built dormitories and more than a 1,000 factory converted dormitories and construction temporary quarters housing more than 300,000 workers and the outbreak situation each dormitory is different.</p><p>Earlier this week, MOM announced the first batch of 60 cleared dormitories. And another 111 are due to be cleared in the coming weeks. We will provide more regular updates to our industry, including a rolling forecast of the dormitory clearance schedule to help employers and their clients plan ahead.</p><p>For workers living in the community, we have also set aside testing capacity to test construction workers regularly to ensure the health and safety and that of the wider community. Er Dr Lee Bee Wah has shared concerns of contractors with the latest MOM announcement on foreign worker levy rebates. We understand the concerns. Government\\'s intention was to enable workers to be temporarily seconded to other firms to optimise manpower distribution, so that more projects can restart sooner.</p><p>However, firms have given feedback about this. For example, some of them may require their workers for their own projects that are about to start and cannot second their workers to other projects. MOM and BCA will review this and we will work with them and the industry to find better ways to achieve this optimisation for the benefit of the entire sector.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, on foreign worker accommodation. Er Dr Lee asked about the new requirements for existing factory converted dormitories and construction temporary quarters. Let me clarify that these requirements are not compulsory. We have piloted the new space norms for new quick build dormitories that will be put up by the end of the year and we have been working with industry associations to make sure these requirements are practical, even as we seek to achieve safety and will be prepared to consider further inputs.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, we have approved more than 20 requests from contractors who wish to build new CTQs or FCDs for their workers and will continue to facilitate such requests where possible. We have received feedback that the COVID-19 restart criteria for construction are stringent. Let me try to explain why we need to be careful.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a project with a single owner on a single site with all workers staying on site. The workers have not left the site since end March, even before circuit breaker. Full attention was given to protection and safety by all levels of management, such as ensuring proper segregation among workers, including not allowing workers from different levels of the dormitories to mix.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet that project had an infection prevalence rate of close to 30% amongst its workers.&nbsp;I share this example which was shared with me to show how infectious disease is and how difficult it can be to prevent spreading from a single case to affecting many more who live and work together. So, imagine how much more challenging in might be for projects with workers living in different accommodation or having to move between different sites, as is the case with many projects with main contractors and several layers of sub-contractors and specialist contractors. But we understand the concerns of companies and will work closely with the industry associations at firms to look at the requirements to ensure that they are practically implementable.</p><p>We are also providing training to help companies put in place safe management measures by offering a course for safe management offices or SMOs. In the month of June alone, BCA and SCAL will train close to 20,000 such officers. BCA will give priority to train SMOs for projects that are ready to start first. BCA is also ramping up capacity further through tech-enabled learning modules. So, please bear with us.</p><p>We know there is a lot of information that is being put out about COVID-19 related measures, sometimes from multiple Ministries and agencies, day after day. Given how fluid and dynamic the situation is, contractors have told us that they are sometimes confused, lost, overwhelmed.</p><p>To avoid the situation where companies do not know who to approach for information, BCA will be the point agency in Government or the one stop-shop front for all matters regarding construction restart. So, if companies have questions or concerns, whether about testing their workers or constructing new temporary quarters, they need to only approach BCA who will coordinate with other relevant agencies to make the necessary arrangements or seek the necessary approvals.</p><p>Because of the current situation, BCA has received a huge surge of calls, emails and queries, and we are ramping up our capabilities to better support our sector.</p><p>We understand that firms are very concerned about their finances during this period when the projects have yet to restart. Deputy Prime Minister announced during the Fortitude Budget speech that the construction sector will receive enhanced support under the job support scheme until August. And let me assure Er Dr Lee Bee Wah that similar to construction firms, the consultancy firms will also be eligible for the higher tier of 75% JSS support for wages paid between June and August this year.</p><p>In addition, companies whose foreign workers are not able to resume work will receive foreign worker levy waivers and rebates until July. Government has also announced rental offsets for qualifying SME tenants.&nbsp;</p><p>Even after construction projects restart, we recognise that firms have to bear additional costs to meet the new COVID requirements, which were not priced into the existing contracts. In the short term, the Government will help to bear the additional costs, including paying for the testing costs for workers. And in the long term, the Government will continue to support the construction industry and provide assistance to cope with the additional costs. We will share more details on the specific measures when we are ready.&nbsp;</p><p>We recognise the importance of the construction industry because without them, we would not have our homes, our schools, our hospitals and other services. So, we will do what we can to help as many companies as possible tide through this crisis.</p><p>And that is also why we have been working closely with our industry partners, such as a Singapore Contractors Association Limited (SCAL), the Specialists Trade Alliance of Singapore or STARS, and the Real Estate Developers\\' Association of Singapore or REDAS, to address the many issues that the industry is facing during this period. In fact, Minister of State Zaqy and I held a video conference meeting with them just two days ago. This was our third meeting in three weeks and we will continue to do so regularly.</p><p>I would like to thank Er Dr Lee Bee Wah and Dr Teo Ho Pin for also joining us in the virtual meeting on Wednesday where there were many constructive suggestions raised. For example, SCAL had earlier provided feedback that there are some construction S Pass and work permit holders who do not live in dormitories, work only in offices and do not visit work sites. In consultation with MOH, we agreed to remove the regular testing requirement for this group of employees.</p><p>There was also feedback that a company had to approach several different agencies to obtain the necessary approval to build new temporary living quarters or to convert existing workplaces and factories into living quarters.&nbsp;BCA has since set up a one-stop platform to facilitate such approvals.&nbsp;Participants told us at these discussions which involve a number of Government agencies being brought together are useful and we will continue to coordinate closely and keep our lines of engagement with industry open.</p><p>Assoc Prof Walter Theseira spoke yesterday about our dependence on foreign workers, including in the construction sector. Let me say a few words about this.</p><p>Our efforts to raise productivity in the construction industry has been ongoing for decades. In line with the construction industry transformation map under the work of the Future Economic Council or FEC, we have indeed been working with industry to reduce our reliance on foreign workers. But this will require major structural changes to the industry and to how construction work is done. We have been pushing for greater adoption of technology, such as through design for manufacturing and assembly, building information modelling and digitisation of the sector from end to end.&nbsp;</p><p>This will, in turn, create higher skilled jobs, including many good jobs for Singaporeans. For example, with design for manufacturing and assembly or DFMA, we will need more production managers, quality assurance personnel and logistics and supply chain planners and automated production facilities. Even our foreign workers that take on such jobs will need to be higher skilled.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the construction sector will not be able to reduce our foreign worker reliance to zero as there will still be many lower skilled jobs in the sector that Singaporeans do not want to take up.&nbsp;We appreciate the contribution of our foreign guest workers who have come here to Singapore to make an honest living for themselves and their families and it is incumbent on us to also take care of them when they are unwell.</p><p>Sir, many firms in the construction sector, including many SMEs are very anxious about survival and about their future. Let me assure you that our main priority is to restart construction quickly but safely. We will coordinate amongst various agencies and lean forward to provide information to you and work closely with your industry associations and with you to resume construction as soon as we can and work together to transform our sector in the medium to long term.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Er Dr Lee Bee Wah.</p><p><strong>Er Dr Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Sir. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Minister Desmond Lee and Minister of State Zaqy for coming in to bring all parties together and trying to help contractors work through the process. And I am very heartened to hear the strong support that the Minister just mentioned given to the construction industry. Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I thought you had a clarification. But thank you anyway. Mr Mohamed Irshad.</p><h6>3.35 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Mohamed Irshad (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I stand here today with mixed feelings. On one hand, I am relieved that the circuit breaker has officially ended. On the other hand, with no immediate end in sight to the COVID-19 battle, I am worried about what the next few months, rather years, have in store for Singapore and Singaporeans.</p><p>I speak for my generation and those young at heart when I say that there are many questions running through our minds. Are we in a grave situation? Yes, without a doubt. Have we faced a situation like this before? No, most certainly not. Have we been in a worse situation? Yes, we have in 1965. Are we facing an existential threat? No, we are not. Do we have what it takes to get through this and emerge stronger? Yes, I strongly and wholeheartedly believe so.</p><p>Sir, what gives me this confidence is that the Singapore story is replete with instances of major crises that have in some cases shaken us to the core. From a forced Independence to the communist threat to the racial riots to recessions to multiple global financial crises to even pandemics, we have come through it all. And it was those defining moments that have always brought the best out of our people.&nbsp;</p><p>As we deal with the immediate issues and pressing problems facing us, I remind myself, Members of this house and my fellow Singaporeans that COVID-19 is offering us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make seismic shifts in the way we have been doing things. This shall form the crux of my speech today.</p><p>First, responsibility to the nation. Second, the future of work. Third, digital transformation and innovation.</p><p>I begin by speaking on the theme of our responsibility to the nation. As parliamentarians, we are collectively responsible for our nation\\'s fiscal health. Mr Speaker, as I have previously mentioned in this House, one of the hallmarks of the Singapore brand is fiscal prudence pillared by accountability and responsibility. It is the reason why we are able to draw on our reserves and table an unprecedented four Budgets in four months.</p><p>Sir, during our Unity Budget debates earlier this year, several Members of this House raised questions about the continued health of our National Investment Returns Contributions (NIRC), which are now the largest contributor to the Government\\'s coffers. In addition to COVID-19, we continue to face long-term pressures such as the geopolitical tensions between America and China, stagnating growth and more nationalist and protectionist tendencies around the world. Given that our reserves form the basis of our NIRC revenue, what is the projected revenue impact of this large drawdown? Additionally, how long do we expect this to last?</p><p>Mr Speaker, I must point out that the first and only previous instance when we had to dip into our reserves was in 2009. Then, when faced with a fast deteriorating global economic environment and the prospect of a deep and prolonged recession, the House drew down on S$4.9 billion from past reserves. And they only used S$4.9 billion. And a mere two years later, the amount drawn was returned back to the reserves in 2011. Today, Sir, we are drawing over 10 times more than what we drew in 2009. We owe it to our future generations to safeguard their future as our forefathers have done so for us. My third question thus echoes the concerns which I heard in this Chamber yesterday. Can the Deputy Prime Minister share his plans to return the money drawn back to our reserves in the years to come?</p><p>&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, we must not be lulled into a false sense of security that our reserves are unlimited. Consequently, we cannot afford to be complacent in how the money is being spent. Even as Deputy Prime Minister has assured us that the Public Accounts Committee has been scrutinising Government\\'s expenditure, we need to instill a mindset of \"active audit\" to ensure that funds channeled for the various schemes and projects are indeed being spent wisely.</p><p>Mr Speaker, this brings me to my second theme on the future of work. This crisis is an opportunity for us to re-imagine work. At various times, this House has debated the importance of improving our work-life balance and having a more sustainable way of life. Sir, this is our moment.&nbsp;</p><p>Our experience over the last three months has shown that being present in the office and having face-to-face meetings is not absolutely necessary for many of us. Members of this House and fellow Singaporeans will be surprised to know that the SGUnited Buka Puasa initiative involving multiple Government agencies, private companies and community organisations was conceptualised, planned and operationalised virtually, without even a single physical meeting. And I am sure there are many other such projects.</p><p>We have, within a very short period of time, adapted to working through video conferencing, private messaging, emails and even the good old fashion phone calls. To quote the CEO of a leading software firm, COVID-19 has resulted in two years of digital transformation in just two months. We need to build upon this rather than going back to old ways. It is time that we reconsider a new model for our companies. Allow me to offer some solutions and suggestions.&nbsp;</p><p>First, as we reopen the economy, we have to fundamentally rethink future job arrangements. I propose moving away from the traditional five-day work week to a four-day work week with the option of working from home on the fifth day and even having a flexi-hours work model. Established companies like Microsoft have demonstrated that a four-day work week can increase productivity by up to 40%. Twitter\\'s CEO recently announced that it will allow its employees to work from home \"forever\". In New Zealand, a four-day work week to promote better work life balance and domestic tourism as a means to help the economy is being considered. As the Government prepares for Phase Two, we should re-evaluate our traditional model of work.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, I hope that after COVID-19, telecommuting will not disappear but will be a more permanent feature. As the Government prepares to work with our companies to begin the job creation process, it is incumbent on us to incentivise the creation of jobs which will allow telecommuting. In doing so, we will no longer exclude those who may be unable to work in a traditional nine-to-five environment for various reasons.</p><p>President Halimah recently said, and I quote, \"Imagine how many more women with young children could remain in the workforce if they could telecommute. Imagine the kind of skills and talents among women that we could retain to benefit our society and economy. With dual income families more of a necessity today, we should make it easier for women with family obligations to work.\" Mr Speaker, it is not just women with care-giving duties who will benefit from this arrangement but many more.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, I came across a very moving commentary by Mr Jonathan Tiong, a fourth year student from NUS. He is a disabled person who will soon be entering the workforce. Being a wheelchair user, one of the biggest obstacles he faced was travel, which he defined as the mere act of leaving his home. Unlike an able-bodied person, he cannot just get up and go wherever he wants. The logistics of transport invariably involves at least one other person for him. He shared from his personal experience that video conferencing will help disabled persons and people with disabilities to integrate better into society by allowing them to lead more active professional and social lives.&nbsp;</p><p>In creating openings and retaining these segments of the population in the workforce, we can then create a workforce that is not only fair to all but also ensure that we maximise our potential to the fullest. I am confident that the National Jobs Council helmed by Senior Minister Tharman will also look into this matter.</p><p>On digital transformation and innovation, since 2014, the Smart Nation initiative has been quietly transforming and enriching the lives of many Singaporeans. At the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2019, Deputy Prime Minister stated that Singapore needs to work towards repositioning itself to becoming a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise.</p><p>As we restart our economy, the importance of the Smart Nation initiative and the words of Deputy Prime Minister cannot be more true. To ride the new wave, we need our people to be digitally enabled in every sense of the word. What this means is that in addition to the various aspects of citizenry, we need Singaporeans to not only be IT-savvy but also be responsible digital citizens or digitizens.</p><p>This pandemic has taught us how under-prepared many were for a global crisis that affected all countries. It has also brought to the forefront the need for digital acceleration and the importance of business continuity plans for businesses and organisations of all sizes. In this regard, there is a vital need for a one-stop digital acceleration centre of excellence that can provide seamless solutions for companies and organisations seeking to ride the coming wave.</p><p>Mr Speaker, a digital economy cannot be the exclusive purview of the rich. Singaporeans living in rental flats and those in the lower income brackets are disproportionately less likely to have wifi at home. In fact, in the last three months, we have seen regular media coverage about the struggles that some of these families face trying to ensure that their children can participate in home-based learning. I understand that MSF has plans to proactively reach out to these Singaporeans with a helping hand. The existing Digital Inclusion framework needs to be reinforced so that no one gets left behind causing a digital divide. I urge MCI and IMDA to redouble their efforts in distributing internet connected devices, and work to ensure that affordable wifi is available to residents living in our rental flats.</p><p>I would also like to express my support and commend MCI and IMDA for launching the Seniors Go Digital Movement. It is timely and crucial to also include our seniors in our Digitalisation journey. Beyond family, friends and the wider community, our model of constantly creating public-private partnerships should not be forgotten. Mr Speaker, I hope that MCI and IMDA will collaborate and work with various tech companies as we continue to ensure our seniors are not left behind.</p><p>On innovation, Harvard Business School professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter said, “Change is a threat when done to me, but an opportunity when done by me.” In my many conversations with fellow Singaporeans over the circuit breaker period, I have come to realise that many of them are embodying a key trait: adaptability through innovation. Let me illustrate this through the lens of our response to this crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When we announced the circuit breaker, we had to adapt to a completely new way of life. Parents had to learn how to work from home while supervising their children in home-based learning. Teachers had to transition to teaching the entire syllabus online. Businesses had to learn how to continue operating without access to their paper documents or any in person interaction. Sir, the crisis forced us to be adaptable. No one was spared from the need to change their way of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Out of this disorientation came the spirit of innovation. We have innovated by adopting video conferencing tools to conduct meetings and even marriages! Our food establishments have innovated by serving their patrons without any physical interaction. Even our wet-markets were not spared. Our civil servants had to innovate as well. The SafeEntry declaration that I scanned today and the TraceTogether app which is running on my phone right now are all concrete examples of innovation driven by our teams at GovTech.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Speaker, this adaptability through innovation has ensured that our country can continue to function.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic is the latest in a long list of crises that have hit the world in recent times. It has exposed our fragilities and the urgent need to rethink our way forward. The multi-faceted crisis the world is faced with did reveal itself in various ways in the last decades, continuously sending us signals on the urgent necessity to take action and embark on a transformational journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the history of humanity, crises have always represented critical junctures allowing mankind to take the path of innovation and positive transformation that contributed to building better societies. The COVID-19 pandemic should be no exception. We stand at the threshold of history to build a healthier, more peaceful, prosperous, inclusive, resilient and sustainable society in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, it behooves me to embrace the spirit of the Singapore Together Movement which has been labelled \"a cornerstone\" of nation building by Deputy Prime Minister as we beat the odds together. With that, I support the Budget.&nbsp;Majulah, Singapura. It is a privilege to serve.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Vikram Nair.</p><h6>3.49 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>: Mr Speaker, when we started this financial year, we had a long debate over the Unity Budget, which was the largest Budget in Singapore’s history, amounting to around $105 billion.&nbsp;This Budget provided what seemed to be a very generous sum of $5 billion to deal with the effects of COVID-19.&nbsp;At this time, the number of cases in Singapore was less than 200 and the epicentre of the crisis was still very much in China, with the largest number of cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Within a month, the situation changed dramatically, as COVID-19 spread around the world, and became particularly rampant in Europe and the US, the number of cases in Singapore started spiking as well as we had more people return from overseas.&nbsp;The Government moved swiftly and Deputy Prime Minister Heng announced the Resilience Budget, which was what we needed in light of the worsening situation and the additional restrictions that the Government had to put in place to reduce the spread of the virus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As the number of cases continued to grow with more and more Singaporeans returning home, the danger of wide community spread emerged and the Government decided to implement the circuit breaker.&nbsp;To tide over the circuit breaker, Deputy Prime Minister announced a third Budget, the Solidarity Budget – solidarity because most Singaporeans, apart from our essential workers, stayed at home to prevent this crisis spreading.&nbsp;Workplaces and schools closed and people tried to work from home while students engaged in home-based learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With the circuit breaker coming to an end, and with Singapore cautiously opening up, this latest Budget, is aptly named \"Fortitude\" and it aims to help get us moving once again in a very uncertain and volatile world.&nbsp;Even as we have this debate today, the world is a different place.&nbsp;Air travel has all but frozen.&nbsp;The Causeway, which used to see a little under half a million people a day cross up and down, is also quiet, allowing only vehicles with essential supplies coming through.&nbsp;The largest number of COVID-19 cases now is in America, which also has an added crisis as the tragic death of George Lloyd has triggered a “Black Lives Matter” with large numbers of people on the street.</p><p>The Singapore Government’s approach in this virus has been nimble.&nbsp;We did not create this crisis, but we have to deal with the fallout.&nbsp;We prioritised the saving of lives with a rigorous system of public messaging, contact tracing, quarantine and the expansion of medical resources.&nbsp;Although we have one of the largest numbers of cases in Asia, which is partly because we have done very aggressive testing, we have managed to keep our fatality rates low because our medical capacity is adequate to provide for all who need it.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ministerial Task Force has communicated regularly, acted decisively and flexibly, staying calm and always having a clear plan for the situation.&nbsp;This Budget, the Fortitude Budget, is the latest additional spending the Government needs and I whole-heartedly support this.&nbsp;Fortitude means courage in the face of adversity and that is exactly what Singapore needs to get back on its feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The earlier Budgets, particularly the Resilience and Solidarity Budgets, helped businesses stay afloat during a time when Singapore and much of the world was frozen.&nbsp;Our people retained jobs even though many were staying at home and were not able to work.&nbsp;Those who were not so fortunate and lost jobs or income received immediate support.&nbsp;This helped our people have resilience and solidarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the time has come to slowly get back on our feet and move and this Budget again provides much needed lubrication to help this process.&nbsp;For businesses, the three main concerns are usually payroll, rental and financing.&nbsp;This Budget has provisions for all three.&nbsp;In relation to payroll, the extension of the Jobs Support Scheme means that many employers, particularly those in troubled sectors like aviation, will continue to get significant payroll support for their staff, up to 75% through to August.&nbsp;Rental waivers of two to four months will be enjoyed by many businesses, the load shared between landlords and the Government.&nbsp;Landlords in turn can get relief from their own mortgage obligations if they need it.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, for many businesses, credit is the lifeblood and the previous Budgets had provided Temporary Bridging Loan Programme and Enterprise Financing Scheme, both of which provided access to credit.&nbsp;These well thought through schemes mitigate the three greatest concerns businesses will have and will, hopefully, give them fortitude to get up and get back in the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For individuals, particularly those who have lost jobs or income, there is also significant help.&nbsp;The biggest concern for individuals who are out of work is \"Will we get more income? And when will we get our next job?\" This Budget provides for both apart from those with high incomes or higher value properties. Whether you are self-employed or an employee, if you have lost 30% or more of your income, there will be relief.&nbsp;In addition to this, payments to families from Care and Support packages in previous Budgets will continue and this will help households meet expenses. There is also significant investment in job creation and training opportunities, with a bold plan to create 100,000 jobs and the team is already in place headed by Senior Minister Tharman to look into this very difficult project.&nbsp;These are exactly what we need during these difficult times.</p><p>All this spending comes with a price tag, and in this case, we will, for the first time in our history, be dipping into our reserves to the tune of around $50 billion.&nbsp;This is significant, but it is also clear that this is not a decision the Government is taking lightly.&nbsp;Based on what we know from MOF’s public data, the reserves managed by MAS are around $400 billion and Temasek has more than $300 billion on its balance sheet.&nbsp;The full figure is, of course, bigger than this.&nbsp;</p><p>Against this backdrop, a one off draw-down of $50 billion to deal with what is probably the biggest financial crisis since our Independence is probably justified.&nbsp;</p><p>We must however be mindful that these reserves built up since our Independence are our “Golden Goose”, and the more we spend of the reserves, the less the net investment income will be. The last time we drew down on these reserves was during the 2008/2009 Global Financial Crisis. Back then we had a \"V\" shape recovery and the Government was able to pay back the draw-down within a year. I do not expect the Government to be able to do so this time.&nbsp;Yet, given the extraordinary situation we are in, I think this expenditure is well justified.&nbsp;I support this Budget.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I’ll continue in Tamil.</p><p>(<em>In Tamil</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-Mr Vikram Nair, Take 24, 3.45-4.00 pm, 5 June 2020 (Tamil).pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>This is a time of unprecedented challenges for the world from COVID-19. Many of our friends in other countries are facing unprecedented hardship and suffering, including being unable to find hospital beds and treatment when they need it and watching loved ones die without being able to be with them in their final moments or attend their funerals.</p><p>In Singapore, we have faced pain too. Although we have a large number of cases, because we have managed the situation, our death rate from COVID-19 is one of the lowest in the world. Now people’s main concern is their livelihoods, and that is exactly what this Budget addresses.</p><p>For those who own businesses, there is support for payroll, relief from rental and financing available. For individuals who have lost jobs and income, there is financial assistance available as well as training to get new jobs.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Deputy Prime Minister.</p><h6>4.21 pm</h6><p><strong>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Heng Swee Keat)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members of this House for their support and participation at this debate on our Fortitude Budget. Members have spent many hours raising many points, so it would not be possible for me to respond to each and every one of their points. But where there are good ideas, the various Ministries will take them up and my various colleagues will address these later.</p><p>In rounding up this debate, let me start by sharing my perspective on the nature of this crisis and the global and historical context.</p><p>COVID-19 is a global crisis of our generation. Within six months, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the coronavirus has infected 6.4 million people, claimed over 380,000 lives, disrupted lives and livelihoods, and closed borders worldwide.&nbsp;Never before have we seen a global lockdown of this scale. The pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in global supply chains, accelerated digitalisation and technological changes, and fragmented global markets.&nbsp;There is huge uncertainty on both the health and economic fronts. In fact, it has opened up other fronts.</p><p>The trigger of this crisis – the coronavirus – will continue to disrupt lives until a vaccine or suitable therapeutics are developed.</p><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects the global economy to contract sharply by 3 percentage points. This is much worse than the 0.07% contraction during the global financial crisis and is unseen since the Great Depression. There are serious cascading effects on employment and people all over the world.&nbsp;This comes amidst escalating geo-strategic competition between the US and China, which could destabilise the global order.&nbsp;</p><p>COVID-19 is having a huge impact on the global economy because it shocked both the demand and supply side of the economy simultaneously.&nbsp;On the demand side, reduced social interactions and weakened consumer confidence have significantly reduced consumption which, in turn, reduced income and investment levels. On the supply side, global lockdowns have disrupted deeply integrated supply chains across borders and slowed global trade and investment.</p><p>These shocks reinforce each other and threaten to impair the long-term productive capacity of economies. Measures that depend primarily on stimulating demand in the economy will not work due to supply chain disruptions.</p><p>Ms Denise Phua and several other Members of Parliament asked about the global outlook.&nbsp;The road to recovery will be long as we deal with persistent economic impact on workers, jobs and business. Beyond economic costs, there will be immense human and social costs.&nbsp;</p><p>The world took eight to 10 years following the Great Depression and global financial crisis to recover to pre-crisis unemployment levels. We should not be surprised that it takes as long, if not longer, to bounce back from the effects of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>The First World War had a lasting impact on the employment prospects of a lost generation of youth in western economies, stripping them of a sense of hope and direction. There is now talk of a global \"lockdown generation\" and fears that the youths of our time could have their skills, employability and incomes permanently affected even after the world recovers from the pandemic. We must work to prevent a \"COVID-19 generation\" of workers and students in Singapore.</p><p>All over the world, we have seen a Catch-22 situation developing as governments grapple with the tensions between saving lives and livelihoods. The reluctance to freeze activities due to heavy economic losses has had tragic consequences. Delayed and incomplete measures to stem infections resulted in a massive number of casualties as healthcare systems were overwhelmed.&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore has managed to avert some of the harsher outcomes from COVID-19. We were able to act boldly as Singaporeans stood in unity, trusted the Government and worked together to save lives and livelihoods.&nbsp;We imposed a prolonged circuit breaker to significantly reduce the community transmission rates over the past two months. We set up a joint task force to deal with the situation among our migrant worker community and the situation is improving. Aggressive testing and the professional dedication of our healthcare team have kept fatalities low.</p><p>Our battle against COVID-19 has reached an inflection point. We have now taken the first steps to reopen our economy safely, in a gradual and systematic way. We are now four days into our phased reopening. If infection rates remain low and stable, we expect large parts of the economy to be able to reopen by the end of June. We will continue to provide support for our workers and businesses to tide through this period.&nbsp;</p><p>Internationally, we are working to gradually reopen our borders safely with other countries. This will allow for business travel, which is essential for our open economy. The Singapore-China \"fast lane\" is a first step in this reopening of borders.</p><p>Around the world, many countries have started to reopen and we are watching them closely. They, too, have taken a phased approach.</p><p>When infection cases slowed to a trickle, China started to reopen in late April, and South Korea, Germany and Japan relaxed their lockdown in May. France did so this week. Infection rates rose for some countries that reopened earlier but they are actively managing the situation and working hard to respond to the new infections.</p><p>We are dealing with a highly infectious and agile virus. The world is learning on the go. So, we must be psychologically prepared that infections could rise somewhat, even with the best precautionary measures.</p><p>We are thus not reopening and going back to our familiar routines but into a new uncertain reality. Singaporeans must learn and adapt to the new reality. We must adjust to new norms, such as higher standards of personal and public hygiene, safe distancing and reduced social contact. We will need to adjust to new ways of working, such as telecommuting, and acquire new skills relevant in the new economy. Changing habits is difficult but we must all do our best.</p><p>Government interventions have become the cornerstone of the COVID-19 response as populations look towards the one institution that can organise and mobilise. There has been a flight to leadership. Administrations, regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum or their belief in government intervention, have responded with substantial support packages. Some have also stepped in to support distressed corporates from airlines to car makers.</p><p>We, too, have mounted a strong response because lives and livelihoods are at stake. We are committing almost $100 billion, or close to 20% of our GDP, to our COVID-19 response. Adding the COVID-19 response to our usual spending, the total size of our four Budgets stands at $193 billion. This is more than double the size of our annual Budgets in preceding years. In other words, we are looking to spend in one year what we would have done in two years or more in normal times. This is a very big commitment!</p><p>Beyond the size of headline numbers, what matters even more is whether resources are directed to the right areas, to enable our people and our economy to rebound faster and stronger. Design and implementation are critical. The measures in our four Budgets have been designed to not only respond to the crisis but to also enable Singapore to emerge stronger. The measures aim to protect lives and livelihoods, deal with immediate concerns and build for our future.</p><p>Our Budgets aim to:</p><p>(a) minimise the spread of the virus and risk to lives, which has largely been successful;</p><p>(b) stabilise the economy, save jobs and viable companies, and protect livelihoods;</p><p>(c) reposition workers, businesses and the community to respond to major shifts; and</p><p>(d) seize new opportunities so as to emerge stronger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have put our people at the centre of our Budgets. Our measures on protecting livelihoods centre on helping people to stay employed and businesses to stay viable. The fortunes of workers and businesses are intertwined.&nbsp;By keeping the economy stable, we strengthen social resilience. By investing in upgrading the skills of our people and transforming our businesses, the economy can recover more strongly.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why over $72 billion, or close to 80% of the amount set aside for the COVID-19 response, is committed to helping our workers stay in their jobs, and supporting our businesses and their employees, which, in turn, support social resilience.&nbsp;As our Labour Movement firmly believes&nbsp;– a job is the best welfare.&nbsp;The remaining goes to public health and social support measures, to supplement and strengthen the significant investments made and structural measures already in place.&nbsp;</p><p>Having set out the global context, let me now respond to the various issues raised in the Budget debate, under three broad themes:&nbsp;</p><p>First, supporting jobs, livelihoods and our future economy;</p><p>Second, maintaining a strong fiscal position; and</p><p>Third, drawing on our deep reserves of social capital.</p><p>Let me start with jobs and livelihoods, which many Members of Parliament spoke about. This has, indeed, been the focus of our Budgets.</p><p>COVID-19 will take a lasting toll on the quantity and quality of jobs worldwide, despite countries\\' best efforts to mitigate the impact. The International Labour Organisation has estimated that COVID-19 could raise global unemployment numbers by \"far higher\" than 25 million. This is worse than the 2009 Global Financial Crisis, which saw additional global unemployment of some 22 million workers. For Singapore, the highest annual average number of unemployed residents on record was registered during the 2003 SARS epidemic, at 91,000 unemployed residents. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is widely expected to be more severe than SARS, with the number of unemployed residents potentially rising from around 73,000 in 2019 to above 100,000 in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The economic fallout of COVID-19 goes beyond unemployment numbers. Even those who keep their jobs may suffer under-employment and significant income loss. This could lead to a vicious cycle where income loss reduces consumption and affected businesses further reduce labour demand. The human and social effects of unemployment and under-employment are no less debilitating. For many of us, having a job means more than getting paid. Through our jobs, we are connected to the workings of the world and to other people, and we take pride in being a contributing member of society. At a personal level, losing a job can lead to a loss of identity, confidence and dignity.</p><p>This is why, when COVID-19 struck, our top priority is to provide fiscal resources to help workers stay in their jobs. The SGUnited Jobs and Skills package seeks to not only grow pathways to jobs, but also equip workers and their firms with capabilities for the coming years.&nbsp;Our Labour Movement is a key partner. I thank Secretary-General Mr Ng Chee Meng and Deputy Secretaries-General Mr Heng Chee How and Dr Koh Poh Koon for NTUC\\'s unwavering support and partnership during these uncertain times, and all our NTUC colleagues who have spoken on behalf of workers in this House. Indeed, every worker matters!</p><p>Our Jobs and Skills Package goes hand-in-hand with transformation in every business and at the industry level, through our Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs). Every business that is confronted with structural changes and the shocks from COVID-19 will need to take a long hard look at its business model. They will need new markets, new products, or process innovations, and need to harness new technologies. They may need to work with their competitors as industries consolidate for scale. I am glad that many of our business leaders understand more than ever we cannot take the \"business as usual\" or BAU attitude, or else there will be no business left.</p><p>Existing jobs will need to be re-designed. New good jobs will be created in growth areas. How do businesses get the right people into these re-designed or new jobs?&nbsp;By hiring the right people and building up their skills. Fresh graduates or mid-career individuals with experience from other sectors are good choices. So are existing staff who can be re-skilled. Business transformation, creating and sustaining good jobs need to be done as part of a coherent business and industry transformation plan. Dr Koh Poh Koon shared many examples of how the Labour Movement has partnered and supported businesses through their transformation journeys.</p><p>There are three thrusts to our Jobs and Skills Package.</p><p>First, we will save jobs in viable businesses and preserve workforce capability in sectors which are temporarily hard-hit. The Jobs Support Scheme, which I have enhanced over the four Budgets, will flow a total of $23.5 billion to support 1.9 million jobs over 10 months. Close to two-thirds of these jobs are in our SMEs. Over $11 billion has already gone out to help employers defray wage costs.</p><p>I am heartened to hear that many businesses have found the support useful and have factored it into their decision to retain jobs and workers. Let me be clear, so people understand. The Jobs Support Scheme is what its name says clearly&nbsp;– it is meant to support jobs. We are not supporting businesses for their own sakes. We are supporting businesses – defraying their wage costs – so that they can retain and pay workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, we will open up pathways to new jobs across a range of skills levels and help local jobseekers of all ages and profiles to access them. As Minister Josephine Teo explained, we will create about 100,000 opportunities to help local jobseekers take on new jobs, including in emerging and growth areas, such as infocomm technologies, financial services and healthcare.&nbsp;</p><p>I thank Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam for agreeing to chair the National Jobs Council to oversee this major effort to keep jobs and help people bounce back should they become unemployed. The Council had a productive first meeting just two days ago. Again, I stress the effort we are making is unprecedented. Never before in our history have we set out to preserve so many jobs as well as create so many new opportunities – 100,000. The Council has already begun its task.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I also encourage our workers to step out of their comfort zone and acquire new skills to prepare for the structural changes ahead. For example, Mr Goo Chong Kiat embarked on a Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) as a Senior Engineer with Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Company during the Circuit Breaker, as he wanted to deepen his skills in areas of Industry 4.0. His advice to others enrolling in PCPs is to keep an open mind and be ready to adapt to a dynamic environment. I cannot agree more!</p><p>Third, we are dedicating additional help to groups which are harder hit, including our graduating students, our mid-career workers and self-employed persons. As Mr Ang Hin Kee, Mr Desmond Choo, Ms Jessica Tan and Prof Lim Sun Sun have pointed out, we need concerted efforts to support these groups. I also thank Mr Pritam Singh for his support. Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad covered many of the initiatives in his speech earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>Our fresh job entrants will get enhanced access to jobs and traineeship opportunities in growth areas, through the TechSkills Accelerator programmes mentioned by Minister Iswaran yesterday. Our public agencies are also stepping up efforts to help. Mr Muhammad Syabil Bin Mohamed Sazali is a fresh graduate from NUS Computer Engineering. This July, he will enroll in the Cyber Security Agency\\'s 18-month Cybersecurity Development Programme. Syabil will be amongst the first batch of 40 officers to be groomed as cybersecurity professionals. With widespread digitalisation, demand for cybersecurity professionals will grow.</p><p>Mature workers will receive strong support from the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package and enhancements to the Adapt and Grow programmes introduced at the Unity Budget. Mr Chew Kok Poh was an Operations Executive with ST Logistics for close to 19 years. With the deployment of Automated Guided Vehicles and a Warehouse Management System, his role was significantly transformed as a large portion of warehouse operation processes became automated. ST Logistics leveraged the WSG redeployment PCP to upskill Kok Poh for the enhanced Logistics Executive role. He now works with the new automation systems to manage warehouse operations and conducts data analysis to plan their weekly manpower resources.</p><p>I appreciate Mr Heng Chee How\\'s support for our schemes to give our mature workers a leg up in the workplace. We are now encouraging employers to re-design jobs as part of their broader enterprise transformation efforts through the Enterprise Development Grant, the Productivity Solutions Grant – Job Redesign, and the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. By pegging the Hiring Incentive for eligible mature jobseekers at 40%, which is double the rate for that of younger workers, we are helping more mature workers to find new employers. Many seniors can and want to work longer. We will continue to support them through the Senior Worker Support Package.&nbsp;</p><p>I join Minister Josephine Teo and Secretary-General Ng Chee Meng in thanking the many firms which have already stepped forward to play their part in supporting the creation of good job pathways. Banks, both local and foreign, are grooming the local talent pipeline, by pledging to offer close to 900 traineeships for local fresh graduates and jobseekers. Mr Seah Kian Peng also spoke about the support from NTUC FairPrice and Enterprise Groups, which have offered some 4,000 jobs and 300 traineeships. I encourage more businesses to think long-term and continue to invest in people, or what economists call human capital development. Skilled workers make strong firms and strong firms create good jobs. Every business, every worker, must seek to maximise this synergy.</p><p>But, despite our best efforts, we cannot possibly save every job. Many sectors were already facing disruptions before COVID-19. For workers who are displaced, you have our assurance that if you make the effort, our tripartite partners will support you to tide through this difficulty.&nbsp;</p><p>Before COVID-19 struck, structural changes, such as the fragmentation of global supply chains and technological changes, were already in motion.&nbsp;COVID-19 has triggered both a deep cyclical shock and accelerating structural changes in the global economy. To thrive, or even to survive, companies all around the world must adjust to these forces with speed and agility.</p><p>In Singapore, we are fortunate that we started our structural transformation efforts early and companies that have made the efforts are adapting better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In 2015, we set up the Committee on the Future Economy.&nbsp;The Committee charted strategies to build our capacity for a vibrant, strong future economy and to create good opportunities for our people. From 2016, we launched our Industry Transformation Maps to systematically bring together stakeholders to transform our industries, across all 23 sectors and six industry clusters.</p><p>Some business leaders have told us that by embarking on transformation early, they have found it easier to pivot to new areas of opportunity. One example is Forefront Medical, a precision engineering firm providing manufacturing services to the medical industry. Prior to COVID-19, Forefront Medical had started building up automation capabilities, adding cleanroom capacity and growing its local medtech talent pool. These capabilities enabled the company to supply to more global medical companies when the pandemic struck. Forefront Medical also managed to pivot into the diagnostics space by acquiring capabilities in reagent manufacturing for COVID-19 test kits. It has already secured a deal with one test kit company and is in discussion with two more.</p><p>Last week, I had an e-conference with a group of start-ups and venture funds in Singapore. The progress that they all have made in seizing new opportunities cheered me, including the safe bicycle helmet, 3D printing of instruments for swab tests and telemedicine. In the interest of time, let me just share a few more examples, to give a flavour of the progress.&nbsp;</p><p>And the first flavor is Shiok Meats, a start-up working to harvest crustacean meats from cells instead of animals, thereby eliminating the risk of food-borne diseases. It aims to introduce these alternative proteins grown in food manufacturing facilities to restaurants in the next two years.</p><p>Novade provides smart field management software for the building and construction industry. Since COVID-19 struck, Novade has launched new functionalities to enable health monitoring procedures on work sites and is now helping clients use these functions to restart and carry out operations safely.</p><p>ViSenze specialises in retail AI solutions, including virtual try-outs of products using a real-time camera recognition function. It has been piloting these new technologies with retailers to get ready for a \"new normal\" in post COVID-19 shopping and is now doubling down its efforts to help retail clients worldwide transform their operations.</p><p>The start-up mantra is to disrupt the world, to make it better.&nbsp;But with COVID-19 disrupting the world, it is good to see start-ups pivoting to enabling us to cope better with a disrupted world, with the right innovations!&nbsp;</p><p>In the face of the deep uncertainties that confront the world today, what must Singapore do to survive and succeed?</p><p>The post COVID-19 world will be different from today. We may not know the exact contours of how this world will look like, but we know the forces that are shaping it.&nbsp;</p><p>The Emerging Stronger Task Force, led by Minister Desmond Lee and PSA International Group CEO Tan Chong Meng, are studying key shifts and developing recommendations in the areas of technology and innovation, digitalisation and disruption to global supply chains.&nbsp;</p><p>In the course of its work, the Task force will consult multiple stakeholders and draw on insights beyond its membership, so that their findings and recommendations are relevant.</p><p>&nbsp;Many Members spoke about the need to respond quickly to the structural shifts, and I thank Members, including Mr Ang Wei Neng, Miss Cheryl Chan and Mr Douglas Foo for their insights. Accelerating our economic transformation is indeed a national priority and both workers and employers must do their part to stay focused on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our Fortitude Budget not only cushions firms to tide over immediate cashflow, cost and credit challenges that Members, including Mr Darryl David and Er Dr Lee Bee Wah spoke about, but also helps accelerate digital transformation and build capabilities to emerge stronger when the recovery comes. Minister Iswaran sets out clearly that this crisis has crystallised the need and opportunity for digitalisation and we can only emerge stronger by making a decisive push towards a digital future. And as Mr Christopher de Souza puts it, riding this wave of digitalisation is key to ensuring that our Singaporeans are ready for borderless job opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>There will also be a premium on resilience. As Mr Arasu Duraisamy, Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Saktiandi Supaat pointed out, one way for businesses to build resilience, is to build up a strong Singaporean Core. This will not only create opportunities for our local workers but also help our businesses continue to operate sustainably even as other economies grow and develop, or even if there are disruptions to external labour supply.</p><p>In our next phase of growth, we must anchor Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise. Like a pearl that is part of a strand of vital global nodes across the world, we must play a valued and inextricable role in the new global configuration. We will do so by forging new partnerships and bringing new value to the world through innovation and deep capabilities, including technological capabilities. I am bringing together the work of our Future Economy Council and the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council to do so, by enabling our industry clusters to harness the rich opportunities catalysed by innovation networks and the creation of new scientific knowledge. And as Assoc Prof Walter Theseira said, we must undertake this great exercise of economic restructuring together, as equal partners and as one people, in the creation of a new Singapore.</p><p>The COVID-19 situation is a mighty storm that has damaged sails and forced ships around the world to go into harbour. While waiting for the storm to subside, we must make the best use of this downtime to build new strengths and capabilities.&nbsp;Let us take this rare chance to repair, upgrade our ship and install new instruments, re-orientate our mental compass and strengthen our sailors, so that when the fair wind comes, we will sail out faster and further than ever before. This is what our four Budgets enable us to do – let us make the best use of these!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I have explained our immediate priorities to support jobs and livelihoods and why we need to accelerate transformation. Let me now respond to Members\\' comments on our approach to fund such measures through our four Budgets.&nbsp;</p><p>I thank many Members for recognising that Singapore\\'s fiscal response has been timely, comprehensive and decisive, and that it is commensurate with the widespread and unprecedented impact of the crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>Our strong response is projected to stabilise economic activity during this difficult period, and position Singapore for recovery.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on a recent study by MAS, our four Budgets are estimated to help our economy avert an average output loss of five percentage points, or $23.4 billion per year, over 2020 and 2021. This is very significant because when&nbsp;you have a higher base, future growth, even at the same percentage rate, means that you reach a higher level.</p><p>As Mr Alex Yam mentioned, some are of the view that we have spent too much, while others think it is too little. These contrasting views show that crisis budgeting is anything but straightforward.</p><p>These decisions have been made after careful deliberations, based on the best information available at that time. As the COVID-19 situation develops, we have continued to enhance and refine our schemes, as evidenced by our four Budgets. Even then, let us stay vigilant – as I said at the outset, we are facing unprecedented levels of uncertainty across various fronts.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Liang Eng Hwa, in opening the debate, highlighted a distinctive feature of the Fortitude Budget – that we are setting aside an additional $13 billion in the Contingencies Funds. Such contingency budgeting reflects both the unprecedented levels of severity, as well as uncertainty, of this crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Liang asked if the Government can provide an indication of how the Funds may potentially be used. As designed, the Contingencies Funds can be drawn upon if there is a need to do so. And as designed, we have not designated specific purposes for the Funds. In sizing it, we have run some \"what if\" scenarios, including the possibility that we may experience a setback in our fight against COVID-19 or the global economy does much worse than currently expected.&nbsp;</p><p>So, unlike our usual annual Budget, where we seek to provide as much details as possible, we are setting aside a sum to meet future events or circumstances that are possible, but for which we cannot yet predict with certainty. This is indeed a special feature that allow us to respond swiftly to unforeseen developments. I thank Mr Liang for pointing this out.</p><p>Mr Pritam Singh asked about the governance around the use of Contingencies Funds. The use of Contingencies Funds is not new. Each year, we have $3 billion in the Contingencies Funds to meet urgent and unforeseen needs. With greater uncertainty, it is natural for us to cater for a bigger quantum. The Singapore Constitution includes safeguards over its use.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the Government will need to seek President\\'s concurrence for drawing down the Contingencies Funds. Second, these drawdowns must be replaced through a subsequent Supplementary Supply Bill or a Final Supply Bill that have to be presented to and voted on by Parliament before seeking President\\'s assent. This provides additional checks and balances over new spending from the Contingencies Funds will continue to ensure judicious use of the Contingencies Funds for urgent and unforeseen needs. When the uncertainty subsides, we can reduce the amount set aside in the Contingencies Funds.&nbsp;</p><p>Several Members have also pointed out another exceptional feature of our Budgets this Financial Year – the draw on Past Reserves. For most countries, borrowing is the only way to fund their largest stimulus packages. This increases the risk of unsustainable debt financing, which has severe consequences for the economy in the long run.</p><p>Countries that have taken on significant additional debt to pay for their support measures will have to find new ways to repay their debt and interest accrued. Future generations will be required to shoulder this debt, be it in the form of higher taxes, higher inflation, or lower returns on their retirement assets. Future generations will also be affected in other ways. In order to service debt repayment, there will be less fiscal room to invest in human capital or infrastructure. The \"Lockdown Generation\" in these countries will end up paying for this crisis a long way down the road.&nbsp;</p><p>We are fortunate that in this hour of crisis, we have our national reserves to depend on. Our reserves allow us to deal with this crisis from a position of strength and give us options in a period of uncertainty like this. Our reserves are our rainy-day fund. Mr Vikram Nair likened our reserves to a \"Golden Goose\", painstakingly built up since our Independence.&nbsp;</p><p>As Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Murali Pillai have pointed out, our reserves are our key strategic advantage in the current environment.&nbsp;</p><p>First, it assures Singaporeans that we have the means to navigate the challenges ahead, to protect our lives and to sustain our livelihoods. Second, it fosters confidence in global investors, that our economic fundamentals are sound and stable in the long term and that we have enough resources to emerge stronger from the crisis. Third, it protects us during this period of flux. Detractors and speculators know well enough not to take advantage of this crisis, to attack our economy or currency.</p><p>We did not get here by chance or good fortune. We have designed and implemented policies that discourage waste or over-consumption. We have run our public services based on outcomes, not on size of spending.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, we are in this fortunate position because of consistent hard work, prudence, long-term planning and discipline of those who came before us. Such prudence and discipline are not always appreciated. We have had vigorous debates in this House, on whether the Government could afford to spend more freely from reserves, instead of running Budget surpluses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even as recently as January this year, before the Unity Budget was unveiled, many commentators inside and outside of this House speculated on how large our accumulated reserves would be. Yet, it took us just three months into FY2020 to use up the accumulated surplus that we had built up over the current term of Government; since the start of this term of Government. And even that is not enough.&nbsp;</p><p>So, mounting COVID-19 packages amounting to nearly $100 billion, of which more than half is funded from the reserves is not a trivial matter, especially when our yearly budget is about $80 billion. The total of our four Budgets, including the COVID-19 packages, is more than double the size of our annual Budgets in preceding years. Our reserves are a limited resource and we must not take them for granted.</p><p>We owe it to our people – seniors, middle-aged, young and those yet to be born&nbsp;– to be prudent and ensure good governance, so that they too have the resources to navigate future challenges in an uncertain world.</p><p>Ms Foo Mee Har, Ms Tin Pei Ling and Mr Mohd Irshad asked if we would restore the $52 billion drawn from our Past Reserves, and how long that would take. There is no legal or constitutional obligation for the Government to do so. The Government put back into the Past Reserves the $4 billion it had earlier drawn on in 2009, during the Global Financial Crisis. And not a single cent of the $150 billion of reserves that backed the Government\\'s guarantee of bank deposits was used, when our banking system emerged safely from the Global Financial Crisis.</p><p>This current crisis is of a significantly larger scale and reach than the Global Financial Crisis. We are facing huge uncertainties regarding the course of the pandemic and its economic and social implications. What we do know is that there will likely not be a V-shaped recovery, unlike in past crises. And the amount that we are tapping on is $52 billion. So, how long would it take to build this back? We cannot be definitive.</p><p>At this moment, we must focus our minds fully on making the best use of the resources that we have deployed, be prepared to work hard in the years to come, and have the resolve to rebuild our economy. In this way, the Singapore economy can emerge stronger, and we will be in a strong position to build up our resources. But rest assured that we are committed to rebuild not just our reserves, but also to continue developing Singaporeans and building Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Muhd Faisal Manap and Mr Dennis Tan asked if the President was given information on the amount available in the reserves when the Government sought her in-principle support for drawing on them.&nbsp;</p><p>I am surprised that both Mr Faisal and Mr Dennis Tan had to ask.&nbsp;It is public information that, under our Constitution, the President has access to information about the size of reserves. Under Article 22F of the Constitution, in the exercise of her functions under the Constitution, the President is entitled to any information regarding the reserves. In addition, on the MOF website, it is already mentioned that the President has full information about the size of the reserves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the process of seeking President\\'s approval, the Government has conducted two briefings to President and the Council of Presidential Advisers. These briefings covered the Government\\'s assessment of the global and local health and economic situations, the details of the measures and the resources needed. Ministers Gan Kim Yong, Chan Chun Sing, Lawrence Wong and Indranee Rajah were with me.&nbsp;</p><p>In our system, the President is the custodian of our Past Reserves. She needs to concur with any draw, and her decision is made in full knowledge of why the draw is necessary, and the size of our reserves. In fact, Members have heard the President\\'s message in the Resilience Budget, delivered on her behalf by the Speaker, just before my Ministerial Statement then. We have a strict governance system, scrupulously observed.&nbsp;</p><p>Some have also asked why the Government does not reveal the size of the reserves and let the public decide if we should use more. As Mr Vikram Nair has noted, the size of the reserves invested by MAS and Temasek is public information. But the amount invested by GIC is not disclosed. As I had explained this to Members of this House during my last round-up speech in early April – it is not in our national interest to reveal the full size of our reserves.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides being a buffer against crisis and providing investment return to supplement our annual Budget, our reserves also form our strategic defence against threats. And as a strategic asset, we would be diminishing its value if we disclose this for potential adversaries to use against us.&nbsp;</p><p>No responsible leader will lay bare your nation\\'s defence plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked if we should take advantage of the lower interest rates now, to borrow more to fund expenditure. Fiscal discipline is one of the fundamental principles underpinning Singapore\\'s fiscal system. We spend prudently within our means and responsibly with a value-for-money culture. The rule to run balanced Budgets for each term of Government remains relevant. We also spend equitably, with the principle that each generation bears the cost of the benefits that they enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>That is why we do not borrow to fund our recurrent spending. Doing so means getting our children to fund our current spending. There will be less resources for our children, after repaying such debt. While interest rates may be low now, there is no certainty that we will be able to repay accumulated debt obligations in the future. This is especially so with the uncertain economic outlook, where all countries, including Singapore, will be operating in a tighter fiscal space.</p><p>While we have good reasons not to borrow for our current expenditure, the Government is already using debt productively and equitably to generate long-term returns for Singapore.</p><p>First, the Government issues debt securities domestically. For instance, to develop the domestic debt market. The borrowing proceeds are invested and we are able to cover the debt servicing costs through the investment returns. Second, as announced in Budget 2019, the Government will guarantee the borrowing by Changi Airport Group to fund the development of Changi East, including Terminal 5. In this way, we leverage the strength of the Government\\'s balance sheet to reduce borrowing costs. The debt repayments will be made during a period when the airport will be generating economic returns.</p><p>Lastly, as I had also mentioned in Budget 2019, the Government is considering borrowing for major long-term infrastructure. Long-term infrastructure requires hefty upfront investments and the costs are lumpy. But once built, they benefit many generations of Singaporeans.\\tBorrowing for such developments allows us to spread costs equitably across current and future generations, without the need for sharp increases in taxes.&nbsp;</p><p>We have done so in the past, we borrow for many worthwhile investments that have benefited several generations such as the first terminal at Changi Airport and our first MRT lines. They will continue to generate growth for future generations of Singaporeans.</p><p>I am glad that Members of Parliament have raised concerns about the sustainability of tapping on the reserves. Ms Tin Pei Ling asked whether we are leaving enough reserves behind for future generations. Ms Foo Mee Har and Mr Mohd Irshad asked how the draw would influence our policies, moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p>The crisis has underscored the importance of upholding the prudence and discipline of our forefathers to spend responsibly, and prepare for the future. This is why, even as we devote considerable resources to overcome the immediate challenges posed by COVID-19, we must continue to plan ahead to secure a fiscally sustainable future.</p><p>In the medium to long term, our structural needs will persist, and significant fiscal outlay will be required. We need to continue investing in healthcare, education and training, and infrastructure, so that we have adequate capacity to take care of our seniors and support an ageing population; so that we give every child a good start, and give every Singaporean the opportunity to re-skill and up-skill to access good jobs, and so that Singapore remains a liveable city and a place we are proud to call home.</p><p>These heavy and rising expenditures were known even before the outbreak of COVID-19. COVID-19 has increased the urgency for some of these investments, such as developing advanced medical research and production capabilities, and expanding training capacity for our workers.&nbsp;</p><p>It is hence critical that we deploy the right mix of fiscal instruments that meets our principles of prudence and equitable spending. As I mentioned earlier, major long-term infrastructure spending, which requires hefty upfront investments but benefits many generations of Singaporeans, may be financed through borrowing to fairly distribute the cost among those who benefit.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, recurrent spending, should be met with recurrent revenues. Such spending primarily benefits the current generation of Singaporeans, and so, it is fair and responsible for all of us to do our part and chip in.</p><p>In the Unity Budget, I announced that the GST rate increase will not take effect in 2021. However, we will not be able to put off the increase indefinitely, and this will still be needed by 2025. When the GST rate increase does take place, we will cushion the impact for Singaporeans. Six billion dollars in funds have already been set aside during the Unity Budget for the Assurance Package. This is sufficient to offset at least five years\\' worth of additional GST expenses for the majority of households, and more for lower income ones.&nbsp;</p><p>We will continue to absorb GST on publicly-subsidised healthcare and education. Overall, our taxes and transfers system will remain fair and progressive. With this differentiated and principled fiscal strategy, each generation rightly pays for the benefits that they enjoy, and we do not saddle future generations with our bills. This is an equitable approach, and will continue to be the cornerstone of fiscal sustainability for Singapore.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a reason I call this our Fortitude Budget. I announced it in the last week of the circuit breaker. Today, we debate the Budget a few days into Phase One of our reopening.</p><p>The Fortitude Budget supports us as we gradually re-open our society and economy, braces us for the difficult months ahead, and prepares us to emerge stronger. During this time, I have seen and felt Singaporeans\\' fortitude in action. We have been driven and inspired by the fortitude of our people and companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Fortitude itself is not an accidental quality. As Mr Christopher de Souza said, it is about courage in adversity. It is forged in crises past, and hardened in crises present. It comes from the strength of mind and character. In the case of Singapore, our fortitude comes too from the strength of our reserves – the financial reserves that I have just spoken about, and just as important, our deep reserves of social capital.&nbsp;</p><p>Our social capital is made up of the intangible bonds that unite our multi-racial society. The bonds of trust among ourselves and between people and the Government. Our national conversations on the Singapore we want to build. It is the spirit of Singapore Together, where all parts of society work together in partnership, keeping us strong and united, even as the pandemic fragments many societies.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">Minister Josephine Teo and Secretary-General Ng Chee Meng shared how our tripartite structure acts to build fortitude in our workforce. I would like to acknowledge and honour the fortitude of our people.&nbsp;</span></p><p>This crisis has brought out the best in our community. Many Singaporeans have come together to donate their Solidarity Payments to charitable causes.&nbsp;Over 10,000 people have stepped forward over the past two months to volunteer. They run errands for seniors living alone, distribute care packs, manage the National Care Hotline and deliver food supplies to migrant workers and vulnerable families, among others.</p><p>For example, during his in-camp training, Mr Rajasegaran Ramachandran stepped up to serve at the frontline as a medic at the Singapore Expo care facility to care for COVID-19 patients as he wanted to do his part for the nation.</p><p>Corporates, volunteer centres and community groups have also come together to contribute.&nbsp;And there are many encouraging stories of people helping one another, such as seniors providing mutual support. Mdm Julie Li, at age 82, frequently checked in with fellow seniors on the phone and shared healthy cooking recipes with them during the circuit breaker.</p><p>Individuals, too, have shown resilience and adapted to seize new opportunities. Ms Catherine Tang, who has mild autism and works at The Art Faculty store at the Enabling Village, attended online courses during the circuit breaker to improve her customer service skills and support the store\\'s e-commerce platform. I met her over a year ago. It is good to see her keeping so cheerful.</p><p>Many public servants across different agencies have been working hard during COVID-19 to help Singaporeans. They coordinate our pandemic response, respond to Singaporeans\\' queries, implement support measures and keep up regular Government services. Many more have stepped up to take on frontline roles such as safe distancing ambassadors to help keep our communities safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me express on behalf of this House our appreciation to our many volunteers and donors to our frontline officers and to all our people in Singapore who have taken the precautionary measures seriously and done your part. Every constructive action adds to our social reserves that allow us to face this challenge with fortitude. I encourage more Singaporeans to step forward and help one another in our community.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, contrary to what Mr Singh has mentioned earlier that we are only consulting people inside the business community, the Government has taken extra effort to take a far broader approach. I think yesterday, Miss Cheryl Chan spoke about Our Singapore Conversation and Singapore Together. Just last week, Ministers Desmond Lee, Grace Fu, Indranee Rajah and I had a very good discussion with leaders in our social service agencies. We all felt very cheered by the dedication of our people in the frontline. They were doing their utmost to support our vulnerable people. It is a great example of democracy of deed&nbsp;– of taking action to make a difference. And Ms Yip Pin Xiu mentioned about the sports community and how they are supporting one another.</p><p>In growing our social reserves, we must continue to support and care for those who have less and those who have fallen on hard times. We will walk this journey with you and leave no one behind.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last two days, Members of Parliament like Mr Ang Hin Kee, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Gan Thiam Poh and Mr Louis Ng proposed refinements and additional measures for various groups in our society. I appreciate your feedback and suggestions. In coming out with each of the Budgets, my colleagues and I had reached out through many channels – social service agencies, community partners, unionists and grassroots leaders – to identify where the greatest needs are.&nbsp;We then carefully considered how we can help those who are most in need, especially those among us who are less able to articulate their needs. The result is not perfect but has gone a long way in alleviating pain points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Zainal Sapari, Ms Foo Mee Har and Ms Anthea Ong asked if we can enhance existing COVID-19 support schemes for low-income workers and households, especially if unemployment persists.&nbsp;</p><p>While some COVID-19 schemes such as the Solidarity Payment and Solidarity Utilities Credit cover all Singaporeans, the overall payouts are tilted towards lower- to middle-income groups as they have less to fall back on in difficult times.&nbsp;</p><p>During this COVID-19 period, 60% of households can receive additional benefits equivalent to 12% of household income on average. These benefits include cash assistance from the Temporary Relief Fund, COVID-19 Support Grant and Workfare Special Payment, among others. This is a significant sum&nbsp;– double that given out during the Global Financial Crisis.</p><p>There may be instances of families who marginally miss the eligibility criteria but also need help. We will assess these on a case-by-case basis, and refine our schemes as the situation develops.</p><p>Other Members like Miss Cheng Li Hui, Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Ms Sylvia Lim raised concerns on how some Singaporeans may feel marginalised by the rapid adoption of digital technology.</p><p>Minister Iswaran laid out our road map for a digital future, with digital inclusion at the heart of our plans. New initiatives like the SG Digital Office, Hawkers Go Digital and Seniors Go Digital will complement existing programmes such as NEU PC Plus and Home Access.&nbsp;</p><p>We take your concerns like the need to equip our seniors with cybersecurity awareness seriously. But we should not let fear paralyse us into sticking with the status quo.&nbsp;As the world changes, we want to move fast on digital transformation but more importantly, we are determined to move together in digital inclusion.</p><p>Ms Denise Phua, Ms Yip Pin Xiu and Mr Melvin Yong also called for more support for vulnerable groups, including those with special needs and mental health conditions.&nbsp;I thank Ms Denise Phua for reminding us of my statement that social service agencies are a key partner in our support for our people. Ms Denise Phua has made a&nbsp;thoughtful suggestion&nbsp;– or several suggestions, including one to formalise a workstream on employment for people with disabilities within the National Jobs Council. I have just spoken to Senior Minister Tharman and, in fact, both of us welcome her leadership on this and are glad to support her proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>Together with our community partners, we have put in resources – finances, networks and systems – over the years to support the vulnerable and I assure members that we will continue to do so.</p><p>For example, we have built up physical networks to strengthen social service delivery through the SG Cares Community Network. Such physical links are complemented with digital ones to build up bonds among people and within the community. WE CARE Community Services set up a cloud-based contact centre and tele-counselling facilities so that staff can take calls from their homes to continue serving persons with addiction issues. This approach increased participation rates among its beneficiaries.</p><p>Together, the COVID-19 support measures should be seen in the context of the larger suite of measures to protect jobs and livelihoods and support our businesses during this crisis.</p><p>Some people have said that the support for jobs is big while the support to me or my household seems small. A thoughtful commentator said to me, it is right that the Government has devoted, as a central plank of the four Budgets, this central focus on supporting our workers to retain their jobs or to move into new jobs, because should the sole breadwinner of the family lose his or her job, the effect on the whole family is much more adverse. So, it is important that we see this in totality, not just what is in each little compartment.</p><p>Moreover, bear in mind that our social spending has nearly doubled over the last ten years and this reflects our commitment to invest in and support our people. Ms Joan Pereira, Mr Terence Ho and Ms Yip Pin Xiu spoke on areas that merit additional support. I would like to assure them that even as we battle the pandemic, we will continue our longer-term investments in education, housing and healthcare and continue to uplift our arts and sports sectors.&nbsp;We will take lessons from COVID-19 to continue refining our social support policies to help build stronger families and communities.&nbsp;</p><p>Individuals and the community too play a role.&nbsp;Miss Cheryl Chan said, \"the Government can act as a catalyst but we ourselves must be the change makers.\" There is a role for every Singaporean to play. We have the reserves of strength and kindness in each of us to pay it forward in deed or resources to help support someone else.</p><p>Moments of crisis are a test of the strength of our reserves and we have the strength – not least of all in ourselves as a people.&nbsp;We have the fortitude to each do our part and emerge stronger.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say a few words in Mandarin before I conclude in English.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/vernacular-Heng Swee Keat Fortitude Roundup 5June2020-Chinese_MOF edits.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Today is the fourth day of the post-circuit breaker period. We have entered the first phase of resuming work and school. As we are unable to predict how the COVID-19 situation will evolve, we will need to remain vigilant and observe safe distancing measures. If everyone is socially responsible, it is possible that by the end of June, we will be able to enter the second phase of reopening.</p><p>In the past few months, the global economy has been badly hit in terms of demand and supply. As a small and open economy, Singapore has also been severely affected.</p><p>&nbsp;In four months, we have introduced four Budgets totaling around $100 billion to deal with the COVID-19 situation to protect our health, save jobs, save livelihoods, save businesses and secure our future.&nbsp;</p><p>The Budget not only protects us during the storm and acts as a buffer during the current crisis, it is also a booster that will drive the economy when the storm passes and will help Singaporeans and businesses prepare for the future.</p><p>The tripartite partners will continue to work closely. This is one of the key factors that will help us overcome the crisis. However, we should not believe that every job will be saved or all companies will be able to continue operating. Those who are badly hit by COVID-19 and those who need to make structural changes will have to overhaul their business strategies. Only by saving viable businesses can we protect every worker and their livelihoods. Hence, the Government will spare no efforts to create jobs and training opportunities for Singaporeans. The newly established National Jobs Council is also committed to help jobless Singaporeans return to the workplace. At the same time, through various measures complemented by various industry transformation road maps, we will speed up the pace of economic transformation. The Government will also help companies reduce cost and retain their workers.</p><p>We will also provide cash grants to Singaporeans, especially to help middle to lower income families manage living expenses, to take care of Singaporeans in need as far as possible.</p><p>In other countries, governments have issued debt to finance their relief measures. Singapore is different, because Singaporeans from previous generations and previous governments have been managing our finances prudently. We are able to accumulate national reserves through the years. Thus, we have been able to respond decisively to the crisis without taking on debt. We will use every dollar wisely so that the economy can recover swiftly.</p><p>In the future, we are determined to rebuild our economy and work hard for our next generation. We will also need to continue to manage our finances prudently, increase our income through sustainable avenues to meet the needs of recurrent expenditures.</p><p>The post-COVID world will be totally different. We must be prepared for the new normal.&nbsp;</p><p>The COVID-19 situation has worsened the impact of economic cycles, sped up structural changes in the global economy and deepened the fault-lines between countries. Digitalisation of the economy will be deeper, broader and faster. Market structures, trade flows, people and capital flows will also be affected. Singapore will continue to strengthen trade and economic links with other countries to stabilise our supply chains and trade networks. Companies must move with the times in order to seize opportunities. Workers must also upskill and be willing to take on new jobs.</p><p>The COVID-19 situation has also highlighted the challenges faced by people in need. However, it is encouraging that Singaporeans have shown their best during this period, for example, cohesion, empathy, and helping those around us who are in need. I hope Singaporeans will continue to show care for others.&nbsp;</p><p>I also hope that through the Singapore Together movement, we will be able to create a more inclusive and caring society.</p><p>This is undoubtedly the most serious challenge faced by our generation.</p><p>The First World War resulted in a \"lost\" generation. Internationally, there are also discussions on whether lockdowns due to COVID-19 will lead to a \"lockdown\" generation. I strongly believe that Singapore has the capability to overcome the crisis. As long as we work together, stay united and resilient, forge ahead with fortitude, there will be no \"lockdown\" generation. Instead, we will emerge stronger and become a generation that is more united, stronger and more resilient.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now conclude in English. At the start of the speech, I spoke of the great uncertainty ahead and the fundamental shifts that are taking place at an accelerated pace. What does this changed world demand of us? There is no easy answer. We need to adapt and transform ourselves – with agility, creativity and determination. To survive and emerge stronger from the huge uncertainties ahead, we must get three things right.</p><p>First, we must have good governance and strong, adaptive leadership – a Government that works with you and for you; that is always honest with our people about the truth; steadfast in preparing and anticipating what lies ahead; and committed to supporting our people and businesses to meet uncertainty head-on and emerge stronger.</p><p>We must have strong social reserves, not just in each of us as individuals or just in our different communities, but across all levels and parts of our society, working together and holding one another up with trust and in solidarity. And we must be crystal clear and unwavering about our values and mission – what we stand for and what we are here to achieve. These make up the essence of the Singapore Together movement, which I launched last year to take Singapore forward. More than ever before, these fundamentals will be crucial as we navigate the uncertainties ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>Our circumstances have changed over the years, but the Government\\'s aspirations for Singapore have not. It is to be a place where our people, regardless of race, language or religion, can build a better life. We seek to be a vibrant and innovative economy, so as to create good jobs and opportunities for our people; a smart, green, healthy and liveable city that we can be proud to call home; a fair, just and harmonious society where our people care for and support one another; and a safe and secure nation, and a responsible member of the global community.</p><p>This is not the first crisis that Singapore has faced nor will it be the last. Past generations of Singaporeans have weathered numerous challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pioneer Generation survived the hardships of World War II. The Merdeka Generation grew up in a tumultuous period leading up to Singapore\\'s Independence. In recent times, Singaporeans experienced the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, the dot-com bust in 2001, SARS in 2003 and the Global Financial Crisis in 2008.</p><p>What about our generation? How will we respond to this crisis&nbsp;of our generation? Each generation\\'s crisis and response are different. The one constant is how we have persevered with fortitude and emerged stronger. This time, there will be huge uncertainties ahead. But we will continue to persevere and we will, once again, emerge stronger.</p><p>We are fighting this battle from a position of strength. We have a strong fiscal position. Our founding generation left us a legacy of a sizeable Reserve, which we must continue to treasure and build on. We have strong social reserves, supported by mutual trust, close partnerships, strong values and a sense of mutual responsibility and support.</p><p>But more importantly, we are fighting this battle from a position of Unity, Resilience, Solidarity and Fortitude.&nbsp;We stand together as one united country and one people.&nbsp;</p><p>We are uniquely fortunate to have built up a priceless harmony, sense of common identity and shared destiny, even as we draw on our diversity of strengths and experiences.</p><p>We are a resilient people. We will never allow a crisis to bring us down. Even in these trying times, we continue to look ahead. Our people are hardworking and disciplined, willing to learn new skills and adapt. We have enterprising businesses that are ready to grasp new opportunities and thrive in the face of competition.</p><p>We stand in solidarity with, and care for and support, one another, especially the more vulnerable members of our society. Our people, businesses, the Labour Movement and the Government stand together in partnership, not in division. We stand in solidarity with countries around the world in this pandemic, building on our assets of trust, reliability and efficiency.</p><p>We have the grit to persevere in adversity with fortitude. We will forge new paths and never waver in our efforts to build a stronger Singapore together. We have a strong healthcare system. We have highly dedicated frontline workers who have worked day and night over the last few months to keep us safe. We will overcome this crisis with fortitude and solidarity.&nbsp;We will emerge stronger as an economy, as a society, and as one united, resilient and determined people.

Head M, Ministry of Finance.</p><h6><em>Head M – Ministry of Finance</em></h6><p>&nbsp;<strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Anthea Ong.</p><h6><em>Transnational Families and Migrant Spouses</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head M of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".</p><p>Low-income transnational families have been particularly hard-hit by COVID-19 and circuit breaker measures. According to an AWARE survey with migrant spouses of Singaporean citizens in May, 99% of 36 respondents have either lost their jobs or seen a drastic decrease in income since the onset of COVID-19. Close to half were not earning any income from work because their jobs did not allow them to work from home.&nbsp;</p><p>Migrant spouses are particularly vulnerable in times of economic crisis as they are often the first to be let go, especially since COVID-19 related job support schemes do not provide incentives for employers to retain non-citizen workers. Can the Ministry consider funding an online platform to facilitate job-matching for these workers&nbsp;at a national level so that employers looking to hire overseas workers could be encouraged to hire from this pool, which includes migrant spouses, first?&nbsp;</p><p>This widespread loss in income is making it difficult for many migrant spouses and their families to meet basic needs. They can receive a $300 one-off Solidarity payment but only if they are on LTVP+. Even so, this amount may be insufficient. According to AWARE\\'s survey, more than half of the respondents reported that, in addition to their current household income, which mostly falls below $2,000, they still need more than $300 a month to meet their basic needs. To cope, some have cut down on food-related expenses; a few said they were unable to pay rent.&nbsp;</p><h6>5.45 pm</h6><p>Can the Government consider relaxing the citizenship criteria for COVID-19 related financial assistance and make them available for all migrant spouses with a<strong> </strong>Singaporean in their household? Only when we include those who have chosen to make Singapore home and help raise our children can we truly say we are “SG United”.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Minister Indranee.</p><p><strong>The Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah)</strong>: Mr Chairman, if I may now address Ms Ong’s questions on support for transnational families and migrant spouses.&nbsp;</p><p>The support schemes announced at the various Budgets aim to provide support to Singaporean households, including those with non-citizen members, who may be concerned over household expenses during this period. These include household-based benefits like GST Voucher – U-Save rebates and Service and Conservancy Charges Rebate under the Care and Support Package, and the Solidarity Utilities Credit. Transnational families would already be receiving support through the $600 Solidarity Payment to the citizen member, and $300 Solidarity Payment to the PR or LTVP+ spouse. This was explained by the Deputy Prime Minister during the round-up of the Solidarity Budget and in response to a Parliamentary Question from Mr Murali Pillai last month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If they or their Singaporean family need further financial support during this challenging period, they may seek help through the MSF Social Service Offices (SSOs), which provide assistance to those who fall into financial hardship. MSF has exercised more flexibility when considering ComCare applications during this period, to ensure affected Singaporean families, including those with non-citizen members, can get help. SSOs will also work closely with other agencies and partners to address the family’s needs, including employment concerns.&nbsp;There are also many Social Service Agencies and those in the community providing support to families in need. These include Social Service Agencies funded by MSF to support transnational families.&nbsp;</p><p>Migrant spouses who are allowed to work can access work opportunities through many channels, including job advertisements, referrals, recruitment agencies and various online platforms.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Would Ms Anthea Ong like to withdraw the amendment?</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Mr Chairman, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p><p>[(proc text) Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed “widespread psychological distress” in COVID-19 affected populations, with mental distress being reported in 35% of the population surveyed in China and 45% in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>A similar picture of a “mental health pandemic” is being observed in Singapore. In an Ipsos survey of 1,000 Singaporeans between late April and early May, one in four respondents said they were not in good mental health. Our national suicide prevention hotline, operated by the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), received 23% more calls in April from March. Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL) has shared with me that their caseloads have significantly increased in the last three months, with many care-givers reporting increases in mental health relapses and crisis incidents experienced by their care recipients, four of them have even lost their loved ones to suicide just in the last six weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To deal with the psychological fallout from COVID-19, countries like New Zealand and Scotland have relied heavily on mental health experts in their COVID-19 response. The extended safe distancing measures for Phase One of exiting the circuit breaker is likely to prolong mental distress, as we continue to deal with social isolation, the lack of personal space, and disruption to routines. Would the Ministry consider appointing mental health experts for the Multi-Ministry COVID-19 Task Force, to advise on mental health implications as we extend the stringent safe distancing measures to re-open cautiously?&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore’s economic woes are likely to continue for the long term, as GDP growth forecasts have been downgraded from -4% to -7%.&nbsp;As the resident unemployment rate climbed to a 10-year high of 3.3% in March, a survey by Profile Asia indicated that many employees are facing increased levels of stress dealing with uncertainty over future pay cuts and their jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng talked about seeking out “opportunities in adversity” during his Fortitude Budget Statement. The COVID-19 crisis also offers us an unprecedented opportunity in equipping businesses and workers for the rebound through improving workplace wellness. A recent report has linked business recovery from COVID-19 to a sustained focus on employee well-being. Would the Ministry consider appointing at least one mental health expert on the Emerging Stronger Task Force to advise on well-being policy interventions to strengthen our recovery from this crisis?</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Dr Amy Khor.</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)</strong>:&nbsp;The mental health of our nation is important, and the Government is committed to taking care of the mental well-being of Singaporeans, especially during this COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic has resulted in increased stressors that impact our mental well-being, given the changes in daily routines, social isolation and economic uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, more support needs to be put in place to address the mental stress that the COVID-19 pandemic and circuit breaker measures have brought about. The Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) recognises this and has been tapping on mental health professionals from MSF, MOH and MOE to give inputs on the psychological aspects of COVID, and in the enhancement and development of mental health initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Our public healthcare institutions (PHIs) continued to provide essential mental health services during the circuit breaker period. Some of our community mental health partners continued to conduct urgent home visits for vulnerable clients and those at risk of self-harm, harm to others, or at-risk of deterioration. Tele-consultations were also adopted by PHIs and community service providers so that they remain connected with their clients to ensure their mental health needs are supported.&nbsp;</p><p>A specific initiative developed is the new 24-hour National CARE Hotline (NCH). The NCH, which came into operation in April 2020, is manned by volunteers comprising trained psychologists, counsellors, social workers and other professionals, and provides support to the larger community on mental health concerns, such as anxiety and adjustment issues related to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>For employees, MOM, along with other agencies, such as MSF, AIC and NCSS, issued an Inter-Agency Advisory with practical steps to support employees’ mental well-being and provided counselling resources for employers and workers to tap on.&nbsp;</p><p>For students, school counsellors continue to support those in need through face-to-face and online sessions. Vulnerable students were actively identified for further support and invited to return to school during the CB period. MOE also provided students with Holiday Care Packs containing resources and helplines on mental well-being and cyber wellness.&nbsp;</p><p>For the elderly, the Silver Generation Office reached out to some 47,000 vulnerable seniors to refer them to assistance as required, including befriending and mental health services. As we gradually ease movement restrictions, we have also paid special attention to addressing the well-being of seniors. The decision to allow children to visit their parents or grandparents is one example.&nbsp;</p><p>The Emerging Stronger Task Force (EST) was set up primarily to develop recommendations on how Singapore should refresh, reimagine or reset its economic strategies, to stay economically resilient and build new sources of dynamism in the post-COVID-19 world.&nbsp;Hence, besides the two co-chairs, the remaining members are industry representatives.&nbsp;Nonetheless, the EST has committed to consult multiple stakeholders to draw on insights beyond its membership.&nbsp;</p><p>MOH, together with the relevant partners and agencies, will continue to ensure that mental health support and services are accessible to persons in need. We will take into consideration the impact of COVID-19 on mental health as we undertake a whole-of-Government review of our mental health strategy and study ways to further strengthen our community mental health services to support new vulnerable groups that may emerge due to COVID-19.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Any clarifications?</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response. Could I then ask if MOH has the intention to increase funding for these community health organisations? Many of them have actually shared with me that, well, we know that there is a long tail to the mental health impact and they are also sharing that increased funding would really help them in terms of increasing their capacity.</p><p><strong>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>: In this Fortitude Budget, MOH has an increased budget to implement many of the COVID-19 management measures. I have no doubt that even as we undertake a whole-of-Government review of our mental health strategies to strengthen mental health services, where there is a need to access additional funding, that could be put into the next Budget, if necessary.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Would Ms Ong like to withdraw the amendment, please?</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Chairman,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p><p>[(proc text) Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Both are start-ups.&nbsp;</p><p>The Deputy Prime Minister announced that $285 million will be set aside to support “promising start-ups”. I appreciate that this is a longer term view to maintain our attractiveness and robustness as one of the top start-up eco-systems in the world. However, start-ups are inherently risky and identification of \"promising start-ups\" is often a hit-and-miss endeavour. I know this as an investor and an entrepreneur. Economic downturns often sift the wheat from the chaff, leaving the most resilient ones behind. By intervening in the sifting process, is there a danger of&nbsp;the Government artificially propping up ailing start-ups and distorting market forces? Moreover, an inability to adapt to the changing economic landscape by continuing to rely on Government financing seems to go against the spirit of start-ups.</p><h6>6.00 pm</h6><p>What was the reason behind dedicating $285 million to support \"promising start-ups\", which can also tap into the many support schemes for SMEs, over other areas of spending, such as extending greater support to struggling households like public rental waivers? Which immediate concerns or areas of national priority will the $285 million be used to address, for example, climate change? What are the checks and balances in place to ensure that the $285 million will be effectively utilised?</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Minister of State Dr Koh Poh Koon.</p><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Dr Koh Poh Koon)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Chairman, start-ups play an important role in our economy. They contribute to the development of new technologies and the rejuvenation of traditional industries. We have set aside $285 million in the Fortitude Budget to provide financing support for promising start-ups. Ms Anthea Ong asked why our start-ups need more help and how we intend to identify the promising ones. In fact, the answer is in her question. The keyword here is \"promising\".</p><p>Start-ups, especially those that work on cutting-edge technologies, need to be nurtured with long-term patient capital.&nbsp;COVID-19, unfortunately, has sharply curtailed the availability of such capital.&nbsp;The Special Situation Fund for Startups is intended to fill this gap.&nbsp;Other countries like the UK and France have introduced similar measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Without help from the Government, many high potential start-ups will likely scale back their innovation activities or even cease prematurely. That will be a loss to Singapore and will certainly have a detrimental impact on Singapore\\'s innovation eco-system, which we have painstakingly built up over the years. By helping promising start-ups sustain their growth momentum, we want to maintain the vibrancy of our eco-system and maximise the value of our innovation-related investments.&nbsp;</p><p>To impose market discipline, the scheme will operate on a co-investment basis with private sector investors that have expertise in assessing the value and viability of start-ups. This will also help crowd in more private capital. These co-investors can also offer industry insights, networks and even mentorships to help our start-ups to succeed better.</p><p>Mr Chairman, the COVID-19 pandemic presents many immediate challenges. But even as we address the immediate ones, we must not forget to put in place plans for our future, so that Singapore, our companies and Singaporeans can emerge stronger post COVID-19.&nbsp;Start-ups are a critical part of these plans.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Any clarifications?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Thank you, Mr Chairman.&nbsp;I thank the Senior Minister of State for the response. I am very happy to hear that we will be co-investing in these start-ups. Could I ask the Senior Minister of State if there is a plan in this co-investing to take equity or is that in the form of grants? And if, once the start-ups are on their way to growth, would we then ask for a clawback of the initial investment or grant?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: You have eight seconds.</p><p><strong>Dr Koh Poh Koon</strong>: Mr Chairman, I thank the Member for the question. Under this scheme, the Government will co-invest in the selected start-ups, together with the private sector, on a one-to-one basis via convertible bonds. A convertible bond is of one of the most expedient instruments to invest into a company in this current COVID-19 situation as discussions on equity valuation can be deferred to the next funding round, hopefully, when the economic situation is better.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Would Ms Ong like to withdraw the amendment?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Mr Chairman, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p><p>[(proc text) Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Assoc Prof Walter Theseira.</p><h6><em>Worker Classification and Income Support</em></h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Walter Theseira (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head S of the Estimates be reduced by $100.\"</p><p>Sir, many Singaporean workers who have lost income due to COVID-19 have benefited from the Government\\'s income support schemes. These help schemes are differentiated between employees, who are eligible for the COVID-19 Support Grant, and the self-employed, who are eligible for the Self-employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS).</p><p>I believe the Government has sought to address the different needs of each group in designing these schemes. However, the maximum cash assistance quantum at $9,000 is higher for the SIRS than for the Support Grant at $2,400. Inclusion in SIRS is also automatic for qualifying Singaporeans, whereas the Support Grant must be applied for.</p><p>This difference in benefits has caused some concern among workers who believe that their employment classification – as an employee or as a self-employed person – does not accurately reflect how they work, their control over their income, and their COVID-19 income risks. There are also workers who are not sure which group they belong to.</p><p>I will give two examples. Our Universities engage adjunct instructors to teach. They are paid on a piece rate per course. This was previously considered self-employment. The Universities were informed this treatment was incorrect. Therefore, the Universities switched to using contracts of service, which made them employees. But the adjuncts are actually still paid on a per-course basis. Nothing has changed about their work. They still lack the income security of full-time or even part-time employees, although they now do get CPF contributions.</p><p>Another example is that of workers who are unsure of their status. I was told that a hair stylist needed to apply for a COVID-19 income support grant. Is the hair stylist an employee or self-employed? It turns out that this person operates under a reverse commission model. The stylist works in a hair salon, she pays the salon owner a percentage of the revenue she brings in. This sounds like self-employment. But then, the salon owner may believe that the stylist works for them and may impose conditions on how and when they work. These cases often have no formal contract or they have a contract which is poorly drafted. An appeal was made demonstrating self-employment and I believe the stylist got their SIRS payment. But the point is that these work arrangements are not always easy to classify sometimes.</p><p>Sir, a worker who faces income risks due to COVID-19 needs help, regardless of how they are classified. Can we do more to ensure that help is calibrated to the workers\\' actual income risks and income level, rather than their classification status? For example, if a part-time or contract employee faces substantial income risks, because they are hired on a case-by-case basis, could they be considered for SIRS benefits instead? We should also review the legal status of different work arrangements. Other countries are exploring an intermediate classification between employment and self-employment for gig-economy workers and those whose work is under the partial control of another. So, really, to cope with the severe shocks induced by COVID-19, we should aim for benefits tailored to income risks, rather than tailored to the classification of the worker.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Anthea Ong, you can take your two cuts together.</p><h6><em>Workplace Adjustments for Mental Health</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Yes, Mr Chairman. Businesses have been hard-hit by COVID-19. Not referenced in the Fortitude Budget is the impact of the pandemic on the mental well-being of employees. I have mentioned earlier that in a survey of business leaders and HR professionals, nearly one in two Singaporeans has had their mental health adversely affected by COVID-19.</p><p>A recent survey also found that employees without managers attuned to their well-being are 61% more likely to say they have been less productive. Hence, establishing workplace adjustments for mental health must be an urgent priority for business and overall economic recovery. The inter-agency advisory for employers to support employee well-being, which Senior Minister of State Amy Khor alluded to earlier, is a step in the right direction.&nbsp;</p><p>Protecting jobs is as important as protecting employability, which includes mental well-being. Can the Ministry integrate the inter-agency advisory into the Job Support Scheme (JSS) such that beneficiary employers must demonstrate effort to introduce workplace adjustments to support their employees? I propose that businesses should adopt Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs), mental health insurance coverage for employees and/or other well-being programmes to qualify for JSS payouts in July and October.</p><p>Also, will the Ministry consider encouraging these progressive well-being practices with further incentives? I propose that the Ministry expands the scope of the Enhanced Work-Life Grant beyond flexible working arrangements (FWAs), for funding EAPs and/or other well-being programmes.&nbsp;</p><h6><em>Jobs Support Scheme </em>– <em>Mitigating Failure of Trickle-down Economics</em></h6><p>Next cut. The Government has signalled that the COVID-19 Support Grant is an important—sorry, that is the wrong one.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: It is okay, the clock is ticking.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Yes, I know. Sorry. I missed that.&nbsp;</p><p>The intention behind the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to protect jobs and salary is welcome. However, abuse has been ongoing. MOM has received complaints about companies taking JSS monies and not using them to support their employees. It appears that workers have been threatened with dismissal if they complain about their employer\\'s errant behaviour.&nbsp;IRAS announced on 3 June 2020 that employers who abuse the JSS may be charged under the Penal Code and face imprisonment and a fine. I applaud this strong stand against abuse of the scheme. However, I also note that IRAS continues to encourage individuals to report malpractices and abuses of JSS. Despite IRAS\\' promise that whistle-blowers\\' identities will be kept strictly confidential, I foresee many cases in which this will pose little obstacles to the employer discovering the identity of the whistle-blower. Some complaints may never make it to the authorities because the employees do not know of the avenues for complaint or are afraid of souring their relationships with their employers. This is particularly true for elderly or lower income employees who will be most affected by the loss of their jobs and are consequently more vulnerable to exploitation.</p><p>To empower employees to make complaints against errant employers and protect the most vulnerable in our workforce, will the Government consider a strong whistle-blowing protection law similar to the protected disclosures regime in the UK\\'s employment Rights Act 1996 that is adequately communicated to all workers so that they are aware of the channels and feel safe exercising their right to whistle-blow. Further, instead of relying on goodwill, should there be a mechanism to make companies that are unaffected by or even profiting from the crisis return their JSS payouts?</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Low Yen Ling.</p><p><strong>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Ms Low Yen Ling)</strong>: Mr Chairman, as we go through these challenging times, the Government is committed to protecting livelihoods and sustaining businesses. The support provided through the Unity, Resilience, Solidarity and Fortitude Budgets is targeted to help keep businesses viable and workers employed, so that they can tide over this crisis and recover quickly as the economy restarts.&nbsp;</p><p>MOM, with the support of the four Budgets, seeks to achieve this in three ways, namely: one,&nbsp;ensuring fair support for all workers – both for the employees and self-employed persons (SEPs); two,&nbsp;championing fair employment practices; and three,&nbsp;promoting mental well-being in our workplaces.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, ensuring fair support for all workers. The Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) has cushioned the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the labour market by helping employers to hold on to their employees and continue paying their salaries, even during the Circuit Breaker period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We introduced the SEP Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) to help Singaporean SEPs with less means and family support tide over this difficult period. Although SIRS is means-tested, the Government has taken into consideration that these are unprecedented times.&nbsp;For comparison, usually, about 50,000 SEPs receive Workfare each year. In other words, they are assessed to need more help.&nbsp;SIRS has now benefited over 120,000 SEPs – more than double the usual number of Workfare recipients.</p><h6>6.15 pm</h6><p>We understand that many SEPs may have seen their incomes fall. Nonetheless, the income criterion serves as a proxy for their ability to save and, therefore, the likelihood of their ability to tide through periods of less earnings.&nbsp;</p><p>It should also be noted that about 80% of the personal income taxpayers earn incomes below the SIRS criterion of $100,000 a year or about $9,000 a month. In other words, one would have to be in the top 20% taxpayers\\' bracket to exceed the SIRS criterion.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the Annual Value (AV) of property criterion, it serves as a proxy for wealth and family support. The Government has similarly sought to cover more people under SIRS. The AV criterion of $21,000 covers about nine in 10 owner-occupied residential public and private properties.</p><p>We understand that some of the SEPs who exceed the AV criterion may not themselves own these higher-end properties. Rest assured they can still appeal to be considered for SIRS. We will work with NTUC to assess the circumstances on a case-by-case basis and ensure that the scheme helps SEPs who most need it. Even if an appellant is not eligible for SIRS, we will certainly connect him or her with other relevant agencies like the Social Service Offices (SSOs) to offer other forms of assistance.</p><p>Mr Chairman, in administering schemes and programmes, such as SIRS, the Government has always partnered various like-minded organisations to better serve Singaporeans and our businesses. This is a key feature of tripartism and has served our Singaporean workers very well.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, we work with the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), NTUC\\'s Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) and Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) to administer the Work-Life Grant (WLG). Likewise, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) is our appointed programme manager for SGUnited Traineeships, working with host companies to review and approve the scope and development plans of the proposed traineeships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Other Government agencies, such as Enterprise Singapore (ESG), have also partnered with Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) to administer schemes for companies. In governing these schemes, the responsible Ministries and agencies determine the policy parameters, including the eligibility criteria. The Ministries set clear boundaries within which our partners must operate, and any exceptions would require the Ministry’s approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Chairman, over the past few years, several Members of Parliament and members of the public have raised concern that some employees could be misclassified as SEPs and, as a result, not received CPF contributions from their employers and other employee benefits, such as leave entitlement. Assoc Prof Walter Theseira also raised this question earlier in his cut.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In determining whether an individual is an employee or SEP, the Singapore Courts consider factors, such as the degree of control exerted by the company and its ability to decide on the hours of work. However, given the wide variety of work arrangements today, each case must be evaluated based on the specific circumstances. The Government applies a similar approach to the Courts when assessing the employment status of an individual.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure that the employees are not misclassified as SEPs and denied their statutory employment benefits, MOM follows up on complaints – every one of them that we received – and ensures that the employers make rectifications where needed. For example, arising from feedback from adjunct teaching associates a few years ago, MOM worked with our Autonomous Universities to ensure that the CPF contributions and leave entitlements were provided to those working as employees.</p><p>I understand that during the circuit breaker period, adjunct teaching associates have continued to receive full salaries from their Universities which are supported by the JSS payouts.</p><p>Secondly, championing Fair Employment practices.&nbsp;The Government has provided substantial support through the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) to help our employers retain and pay local workers. Deputy Prime Minister Heng recapped and shared with us that the JSS amounted to $23.5 billion, protecting 1.9 million jobs for Singaporeans. Employers should act responsibly and fairly, and make sure that they are ensuring that their local workers are given wages even if they are unable to work.</p><p>I want to assure Ms Anthea Ong that the Government takes a very serious view of irresponsible, unfair or fraudulent employment practices, including false reporting of workers\\' CPF payments by employers to obtain higher JSS payouts. We take a whole-of-Government approach to identify such fraudulent cases. As highlighted in the media release by IRAS on Wednesday this week, there are severe penalties for any attempt to abuse the JSS.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to assure Ms Ong that workers need not be afraid to come forward to report any infringement of employment laws, because the Employment Act protects them from wrongful dismissal by employers, especially those who seek to punish workers for exercising their rights.&nbsp;</p><p>Employers who wrongfully dismiss their workers may be ordered to pay compensation or to reinstate workers to their former jobs. Errant employers may also see a withdrawal of Government-paid employment support or suspension of their Work Pass privileges. MOM takes all feedback on employment law infringements very seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>During this difficult period, workers and employers have to work even more closely together than ever before and strive to maintain open channels of communication. As Mr Louis Ng pointed out, employees may need greater work flexibility to deal with the disruptions that arise due to COVID-19. Likewise, Mr Desmond Choo and Ms Sylvia Lim raised points regarding the challenges of workers, in particular, women, face and how Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) can benefit employers, employees and the society in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>FWAs help workers better prepare and better balance their commitments at home and at work, and enable women to remain in the workforce, gain work experience, earn higher wages and assume leadership positions. MOM has been working with the tripartite partners to improve workers\\' access to FWAs, such as by providing support via the Work Life Grant (WLG) and recognising progressive employers through the Tripartite Standard on FWAs.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result of COVID-19, many more companies are working from home now and are benefiting from FWAs. We will seize the opportunity to continue this momentum and ensure that work-from-home arrangements are sustained beyond the COVID-19 period. This will not only strengthen business resilience; it will better support work-life harmony for all workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, ensuring workers\\' mental well-being. As more businesses gradually resume operations, workers will take some time to adjust to the new normal as well as different working arrangements. Since the start of COVID-19, there has been many changes and adjustments. We understand that workers may face additional stress, and some may have mental health challenges. I agree with Ms Anthea Ong that we must look into our workers\\' mental health as we also seek to protect as many jobs as possible during this challenging period.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Ong had suggested that we consider introducing additional requirements to qualify for JSS payouts. However, the intent of JSS is, as I have mentioned earlier, to help the companies retain and pay for local workers. It is to help as many companies stay afloat and keep jobs for Singaporeans. So, really, the JSS is a temporary scheme designed to help companies save jobs for Singaporeans during this period of economic uncertainty. Adding too many conditions would only make it more difficult for the employers to benefit from JSS or, inadvertently, cause a delay in employers getting the urgent help they need. Jobs may be lost if the employers do not get timely help.</p><p>Instead, we have been working on other ways to encourage our employers to implement progressive practices and workplace adjustments to take care of our workers\\' mental health needs in the workplace.&nbsp;</p><p>During the Committee of Supply (COS) in March, Ms Ong will remember that MOM announced that we will formulate a Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-being to educate our employers on basic mental health knowledge and make available the resources to help them. We will work with the tripartite partners to evaluate the possibility of including an Employee Assistance Programme as well as insurance coverage for mental health as part of the upcoming Tripartite Advisory, which will be finalised in the second half of this year.</p><p>We are also working closely with the various Government agencies and the Labour Movement to provide our employers with resources that can support their workers\\' mental well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Chairman, what I have just shared are ways in which we are supporting our workers and employers to overcome the challenges arising from COVID-19. During the circuit breaker, we have all come across many heart-warming and heartening stories of how businesses, workers and Singaporeans are rallying behind one another as one community. As we slowly reopen the economy and transit to a new normal, I am confident that the unity and the fortitude of our workers and the employers will see us through this crisis and help us emerge stronger together.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Clarifications. Ms Anthea Ong.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Mr Chairman, I thank Senior Parliamentary Secretary Low for her response. I would like to ask if the Senior Parliamentary Secretary could answer my question. Should there be a mechanism to make companies that are unaffected by or even profiting from the crisis return their JSS payouts? That is one. Secondly, I am very heartened that the Senior Parliamentary Secretary is reiterating that employees should come forward because they are protected under the Employment Act, if they have errant employers.</p><p>How are we actually making sure that this is made known, particularly to the more vulnerable employees, that they have this right? Many of them are sharing with me that they are so afraid to come forward because,&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">first of all, they do not know they have this right and, secondly, they are worried about employers actually making life harder for them.</span></p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: The longer the question, the shorter the answer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: I will just keep it to two then, Mr Chairman, on your cue.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;You have 20 seconds.</p><p><strong>Ms Low Yen Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you. I want to thank the Member, Ms Anthea Ong, for her supplementary question. On the first one about whether there are companies profiteering from the crisis. Earlier on, I mentioned that the JSS is targeted to help companies retain and pay their local workers. In designing the JSS, MOF as well as MOM and the various Ministries sought to achieve a balance between targeted assistance and also administrative efficiency, because this is really a crisis period. You want to make sure that the help reach the intended target audience as expeditiously as possible and make sure that we save every job. So, we strike a good balance between targeted assistance and administrative efficiency in designing the JSS.</p><p>I would like to inform Ms Ong that a large percentage of our firms and local employees, as the Deputy Prime Minister has mentioned, will be severely impacted. And earlier on, when he reminded us that the JSS amounted to $23.5 billion protecting 1.9 million jobs, two-thirds of our SMEs benefit from this. It is really important to provide the support to them. So, the question the Member asked&nbsp;—</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Kindly wrap up, Ms Low.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ms Low Yen Ling</strong>: So, to identify and exclude individual employers from this scheme will certainly need another level or, in fact, a few levels of administrative operations to sift through, especially when the eventual economic impact to them remains uncertain. It may not be administratively efficient to do so. So, I just want to share the balance between providing the help in an efficient way to the target audience vis-a-vis operational complexity. Now, I also want to reassure Ms Ong —</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Low, can you just wrap up quickly?</p><p><strong>Ms Low Yen Ling</strong>:&nbsp;Yes. I want to assure Ms Ong that any irresponsible or unfair, fraudulent employment practises, including a false reporting of CPF contributions and so on will be dealt with severely and we will not hesitate to take actions accordingly. And we really urge the workers to report such errant employers. The Member will be familiar with our various programmes like Work Right and so on. We do have MOM officers going out not just to big companies, but also to small ones to share with them the rights of our workers, what are their rights under the Employment Act and how they would be protected. So, they need not fear because the Employment Act protects them, especially those who have been wrongfully dismissed.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Thank you.

Ms Anthea Ong.</p><h6><em>Gaps in COVID-19 Support Grant</em></h6><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Chairman, I beg to move, \"That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the Estimates be reduced by $100\".</p><p>The Government has signalled that the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) is an important piece in the array of COVID-19 welfare schemes by pumping in $800 million as part of the Fortitude Budget. However, I would like to bring attention to several aspects of the scheme that obstruct it from fully meeting the needs of those who need it most.</p><p>First, its overly strict eligibility criteria. Applicants have to first show that they have lost or will lose income over three months. For those whose initial conditions of no pay leave or reduced income do not reflect at least three months, they will have to wait to become eligible for CSG. This will be the case for most employees, especially lower wage workers, many of whom who do not even have a document from their employers spelling out conditions of leave. It would be inconceivable to expect employers who lay off employees to provide a confirmation that the employee will have three months of income lost, nor is it logical to expect individuals to show loss of future income of at least three months now.</p><p>From May 2020, there is no interim support scheme that can help to tide such individuals over.&nbsp;Further, the amount and duration of support provided under CSG is ungenerous, especially when compared to the Self-employed Persons Income Relief Scheme (SIRS). Crucially, members of society in precarious positions are excluded from CSG, such as individuals with no bank account or daily-rated workers.</p><p>Hence, I recommend that the Government reduce the required period for involuntary no pay leave or duration of income loss from three consecutive months to one month and allow individuals with no bank account and daily-rated or ad hoc workers to be eligible for CSG. The duration of support should also be extended from three months to nine months or when applicants are able to secure a job, whichever is earlier.</p><p>If the Ministry disagrees, individuals who have been financially affected by COVID-19 will be forced to apply for ComCare financial assistance in the interim or after they have exhausted their full CSG payout. Given the almost five-fold difference in income eligibility criteria of CSG versus ComCare, will the Ministry consider enhancements to ComCare such as: (a) increasing the income eligibility caps for ComCare and (b) increasing the flexibility with regard to supporting documents required? For instance, instead of strictly requiring bank statements, one could be allowed to produce documents that show job or income loss.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>:&nbsp;Senior Parliamentary Secretary&nbsp;Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim.</p><p><strong>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social and Family Development (Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim)</strong>: Mr Chairman, the COVID-19 Support Grant (CSG) supports lower to middle income Singaporeans or Permanent Residents who, as a result of the economic impact of COVID-19, are presently (a) involuntarily unemployed due to retrenchment or contract termination;&nbsp;(b) placed on involuntary no-pay leave (NPL) for at least three consecutive months; or (c) experiencing reduced monthly salary of at least 30% for at least three consecutive months.</p><p>While MSF provides support for affected employees through CSG, employees are also supported through the Jobs Support Scheme. Self-employed persons (SEPs) are mainly supported through the Self-employed Persons Income Relief Scheme or SIRS.&nbsp;</p><p>Employees who have lost their jobs can apply for CSG immediately without waiting for three months.&nbsp;</p><p>Employees who are placed on involuntary NPL or experiencing reduced monthly salary need not wait till they are affected for three consecutive months to apply. They are eligible for CSG if their NPL or salary loss has already started and they provide supporting documents, such as a letter from their employer, showing that the involuntary NPL or salary reduction will be for at least three consecutive months.&nbsp;The \"three or more consecutive months\" requirement for involuntary NPL and salary loss scenarios is to ensure that help is channelled to those who have greater needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Daily-rated and ad hoc workers may qualify for CSG if they meet the eligibility criteria. Workers who do not have employment contracts due to the nature of their work may approach their nearest Social Service Offices&nbsp;or SSOs to make a self declaration on their employment status. This includes daily-rated and ad hoc workers. SSOs will undertake further checks against applicants\\' past CPF records and facilitate their CSG application if they qualify. Individuals eligible for CSG and without bank accounts can approach SSOs for assistance.</p><p>Those who are ineligible for CSG and are in financial need can apply for ComCare, which provides financial assistance for basic living expenses and other support such as household bill expenses and medical expenses. In general, those who are newly placed on ComCare will receive at least six months of assistance, which provides them with a longer runway to regain stability.</p><p>For those with urgent financial needs, SSOs, grassroots organisations and Family Service Centres can provide them with ComCare Interim Assistance.</p><p>ComCare&nbsp;Short-to-Medium-Term Assistance (SMTA) and Interim Assistance have income eligibility criteria of a monthly household income of $1,900 and below or per capita household income of $650 and below.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Senior Parliamentary Secretary&nbsp;Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, please wrap up.</p><p><strong>Assoc Prof Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim</strong>:&nbsp;These are not hard thresholds and each case is considered on its own merit. Supporting documents including bank statements and payslips enable SSOs to accurately assess the applicants\\' circumstances, savings and needs. SSOs exercise flexibility as needed to provide the necessary financial assistance and social support. SSOs can conduct their interviews and assessments electronically and applicants can submit their supporting documents via email.</p><p>While CSG is open for applications from May 2020 till September 2020, the Government will continue to review our support schemes for those who need help, taking into account how the COVID-19 situation evolves.</p><p><strong>The Chairman</strong>: Ms Ong, would you like to withdraw the amendment, please?</p><p><strong>Ms Anthea Ong</strong>: Thank you, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, for your response.

       "  'content': '<p>[(proc text) Order for Second Reading read. (proc text)]</p><h6>6.45 pm</h6><p><strong>The Minister for Law (Mr K Shanmugam)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time\".</p><p>This Bill comes before Parliament in the midst of very serious challenges faced by us, which both Ministers and Members of Parliament have spoken about a number of times.</p><p>In my speech, I will explain why we need this intervention, explain the principles behind the Bill and set out the key features of the Bill.</p><p>Just under two months ago, I moved an urgent Bill in this House – the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill, which I will refer to as “COVID 1”. COVID 1 was, in itself, a major intervention.</p><p>In my speech then, I explained why intervention was needed – economic shock, unprecedented in magnitude in terms of impact and the speed with which the impact was felt.</p><p>I also set out the principles for such intervention. The starting point is always the sanctity of contract – a fundamental, key aspect of the rule of law and we do not lightly intervene.&nbsp;</p><p>But sanctity of contract cannot be an absolute. I said that intervention is needed when the core interests of our people are at stake and there is a need to safeguard the fundamental integrity of the economic structure for the common good. Such intervention has to be reasonable and of generally limited duration.</p><p>In COVID 1, we put in what I called a “legal circuit breaker”. It provided a framework to hold in abeyance the strict enforcement of certain legal rights for a period of time.&nbsp;</p><p>The objective was to give businesses some cash flow relief and breathing space to make adjustments. For example, if a business tenant is unable to pay rent during the relief period because of COVID-19, the landlord cannot evict the tenant during the relief period. The moratorium runs until 19 October 2020.</p><p>At the time, I emphasised that COVID 1 only deferred contractual obligations. I also explained to this House that the Bill gave businesses breathing space. It also gave the Government some time to take in feedback, assess the evolving situation, conduct a deeper analysis and decide whether more substantive interventions were needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past two months, we have done precisely that. We have monitored feedback, assessed the situation, thought carefully about what else needed to be done. And we have decided to intervene in a more substantive way to deal with the issue of rent. And also, intervene in some other areas. I will explain why.&nbsp;</p><p>Two months ago, the circuit breaker began. For many, including the businesses most affected by those measures, April now feels like a lifetime away.</p><p>Globally, we were looking at 1.2 million infections and 67, 000 dead. As of 1 June, we are looking at more than 6 million infections and more than 370,000 dead.</p><p>Various restrictions had already been put in place by then, but the circuit breaker caused a substantial increase in the restrictions.</p><p>The situation today? The Deputy Prime Minister and other Ministers have explained in considerable detail.&nbsp;</p><p>I will just recap two key points. The economic situation and outlook has deteriorated substantially. MTI is now forecasting a contraction of between 4% and 7%. And there is a lot of uncertainty.</p><p>We are taking a cautious approach in lifting the circuit breaker measures. Many industries are affected. And for some, the impact has been near catastrophic.</p><p>Latest data from the Department of Statistics, some just released today. If you look at F&amp;B sales in March 2020, they declined by 23.7%. In April 2020, they declined by 53% on a year-on-year basis. Retail sales, if you exclude supermarkets, hypermarkets and convenience stalls, retail sales in March 2020 declined by 13.3%. In April 2020, nearly 61%.&nbsp;</p><p>These numbers do not even show the full impact of the circuit breaker because data for May 2020 is not out yet. We can, obviously, expect the numbers to be very weak.</p><p>Revenue has fallen but meanwhile fixed costs continue. For many businesses, in the F&amp;B, retail sector, two significant components of such costs are manpower and rent.</p><p>As regards manpower, the Government through the various Budgets has put in the Jobs Support Scheme, waived the Foreign Worker Levy and put in a number of other schemes to help, together with partners like NTUC.</p><p>This Bill seeks to deal with the rental obligations, amongst other things.</p><p>Many landlords have taken a helpful approach and a long-term view. They have shared the burden with their tenants.</p><p>Nevertheless , we received a lot of feedback from struggling SMEs that they need more time to recover. Many cannot operate until Phase Two, and even then only partially.</p><p>Landlords’ concessions have been uneven. Many landlords have rendered substantive assistance, but several others have not.</p><p>The point is that accumulated arrears should be handled fairly.&nbsp;</p><p>I will share one piece of feedback as an illustration. This is a tenant who is a mother of two young children. She started a company two years ago, providing enrichment lessons to children. She leased some space for the business as a sub-tenant. She renewed her lease for one year, just before COVID-19 hit.&nbsp;</p><p>All revenue that came in went to support the business – payment of rent, salaries for trainers and other operational costs. But from February 2020, parents began to keep students away. Classes have been suspended since March 2020. Her landlord has offered her 10% discount for April and May 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>COVID-19 is quite an unforeseeable event, both in magnitude and speed of impact. It is wiping out the hard work that many people have put in into their businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>So, if landlords insist on payments that tenants cannot afford, tenants will have to give up. Landlords then have to take their chances to recover something in the insolvency proceedings, together with other creditors.</p><p>Landlords will then also have to find replacement tenants. In this market, not realistic.</p><p>Therefore, it is in everyone’s interests to take a sensible approach, ensure everyone comes out of this together, ready to recover.</p><p>If you look at restaurant booking platform Chope, they did a survey: 81% of their respondents said they would not be able to operate beyond the next six months, based on cost and revenue that they had during the circuit breaker period.</p><p>After watching all of this carefully, taking in the feedback, looking at the numbers that were coming in, we decided that there is a need for a substantive intervention.</p><p>The challenge that rent poses to small businesses, is not a problem unique to Singapore. A number of other countries have seen that and they have intervened. I will just give the examples of Australia and Germany.</p><p>In Australia, landlords are required to offer rent waivers and deferrals to SME tenants. And SME tenants are allowed to repay the deferred rent over a period of at least 24 months, interest-free.&nbsp;</p><p>In Germany, landlords are not allowed to terminate a tenancy for non-payment of rent. And arrears with accumulated interest can be repaid before 30 June 2022; that means, two years of extension.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me now move, Mr Speaker, to the premises underlying this Bill. What is necessary in this situation is a fair sharing of obligations because of the exceptional times that are before us. The fair sharing has got to be between the Government, the landlords and the tenants.</p><p>On the Government’s part, you have seen four Budgets amounting to almost $93 billion, including two months\\' rental assistance for retail, F&amp;B tenants; one month for office and industrial tenants, as well as broad salary support and other credit-easing facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>So, if you look at the rest of the burden, what is a fair sharing of the remainder between landlords and tenants? And the related question is, will the market left to itself be able to find an equilibrium that reflects the principle of fairness?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The answer to these two related questions depends on a number of points.</p><p>First, all Singaporeans, including landlords, have a shared interest in seeing our SMEs do well. Second, in a climate like this, expecting market forces to push towards a fair equilibrium is not realistic. Third, what is the alternative if we do not intervene?</p><p>SMEs play, as I have said, a critical role in the Singapore economy. In 2019, the 260,000 SMEs in Singapore contributed to 45% of our GDP and 72% of our employment.</p><p>If many of our SMEs for whom a stable cash flow is fundamental, are unable to survive, the domino effect on the rest of the economy will be very substantial and a lot of jobs will be at stake. Our people will suffer.</p><p>For landlords, their asset value will be affected by the broader economy. There is a clear correlation between growth of property prices and economic growth. If our SMEs do well, the economy is given a boost, property owners will continue to enjoy the stable value of their assets. If viable SMEs go under because of temporary cash flow difficulties, the economy as a whole suffers, the value of property will also suffer.</p><p>So, the essential point: everyone has a stake in the viability of the SMEs.&nbsp;</p><p>My third and final point is: go back to the eligibility criteria. They cover SME renting commercial, industrial or office space for the operation of their business and those with a turnover of not more than S$100 million per annum and where they had a reduction in turnover of more than 35%, which is a substantial hit.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Order.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Minister, please resume.</p><h6>6.59 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: Thank you, Sir.&nbsp;Let me now take Members through the key features of the Bill.</p><p>The Bill has three key aspects.&nbsp;First, landlords will be required to ensure that the benefits of Governments assistance are given to the actual, intended beneficiaries. That is, the SME tenants operating in rented premises and this will include licencees.</p><p>Second, landlords may also be required to provide a further waiver of up to two months’ of rent to qualifying SME tenants.</p><p>And third, SMEs who qualify for the rental waiver will also be given time to repay some of their remaining rental arrears, at an interest rate that will be capped.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As said earlier, most of these reliefs apply to SME tenants, including sub-tenants and licencees.</p><p>The rental relief framework will also apply to eligible Non-Profit Organisations and eligible tenants of Government properties.&nbsp;</p><p>The Deputy Prime Minister announced property tax rebates from the Resilience and Unity Budgets. The Government will be providing approximately two months of rental assistance for eligible SME tenants of qualifying commercial properties and approximately one month of rental assistance for eligible SME tenants of other non-residential properties; basically, industrial and office properties.</p><p>This will be done via rental waivers, granted by landlords.</p><p>Agencies are working out the details, which will give landlords clarity on the relief that they are required to offer; and give tenants clarity on the relief that they will get. This will be set out in subsidiary legislation.</p><p>The Bill will require landlords to match what the Government is doing. They will be required to grant qualifying SME commercial tenants an additional waiver of two months’ rental, of base rent; and qualifying SME industrial and office tenants an additional one month’s waiver of base rent.</p><p>This additional relief will apply to SME tenants who have suffered at least a 35% drop in average monthly revenue in April and May 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This will be calculated at the rental unit or outlet level.&nbsp;</p><p>Tenants must have entered into their tenancy before 25 March 2020, or extended such a tenancy to get this relief.&nbsp;</p><p>There are smaller landlords who face genuine hardship. For example, retirees who have purchased a small commercial property, and the rental yield from that property forms a very large proportion of their income. For this group, they may seek an assessment on grounds of financial hardship. The assessment will take into consideration the annual value of the landlord’s properties, and whether the rental income forms a substantial part of his or her total income.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Qualifying landlords will only be required to give half of the additional rental waivers. And we will set out the criteria for landlords to qualify for this in subsidiary legislation.</p><p>During our consultations, stakeholders have asked for clarity on a few matters. Landlords wanted more clarity on when their obligations will be triggered. Tenants wanted clarity on when they will be entitled to the relief.</p><p>For the landlords, their obligations will be triggered when IRAS issues the notice of the cash grant or nominal notice to eligible property owners. IRAS will provide more details of the cash grant on its website, once it works the details out.</p><p>Meanwhile, to preserve the status quo, the Bill provides for a moratorium on enforcement action for non-payment of rent in the time between the Act coming into force and the triggering of the landlords’ obligations.&nbsp;</p><p>Even before the Act comes into force, tenants who are unable to pay their rent and require protection from eviction can serve a Notification for Relief under COVID 1, as it exists today.</p><p>Second, we recognise that many landlords may have already given relief. This could be in the form of rental waivers or rebates. These landlords will be able to set off the equivalent value against the amount of waiver that they are required to give under the Bill.</p><p>The kinds of reliefs that landlords have given and which can be taken into account for this purpose will be set out in subsidiary legislation.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, what if the tenant has already paid the rent for the months in which relief is meant to be granted or for the months for which relief is meant to be granted? In such a situation, the landlord will be required to credit any amounts already paid to the tenant. This may be in the form of the waiver being applied in the next month of rent that is due. If the lease is coming to an end, the landlord will have to provide a refund to the eligible tenant.&nbsp;</p><p>Fourth, MAS has separately announced some additional relief from banks and finance companies in relation to landlords’ existing loan repayment obligations. Individual landlords who have been required to provide relief to their tenants under this Bill can apply to defer both principal and interest payments on their commercial and industrial property loans till the end of the year. So, if moratorium is given until October for tenants; landlords will get assistance from their financial institutions.</p><p>They can also apply for an extension of loan tenure by up to the corresponding deferment period to make the monthly instalments more manageable.</p><p>SME landlords who face financial difficulties can already apply to defer the principal repayments on their mortgages under the industry relief package that MAS announced some weeks ago.</p><p>Larger landlords can likewise work with their banks and finance companies if they require assistance.</p><p>Those who need to access additional credit to meet their immediate cashflow needs can either apply for mortgage equity withdrawal loans or loans under ESG’s Temporary Bridging Loan Programme or Working Capital Loan Scheme, if they qualify.&nbsp;</p><p>SME tenants who are eligible for the additional relief described above can also get relief under the third plank of the Bill. They will be allowed to defer payment of a part of the rental arrears accrued from 1 February, until 19 October 2020. They will have to start repaying the arrears from November 2020. These arrears, of course, do not include, for example, the four months which have been waived – these are no longer payable.</p><p>Tenants can elect to repay their rental arrears in equal instalments, with payment of the first instalment to start no later than November 2020 and that can be done during the duration of the remaining term of their tenancy, up to a maximum of nine months, with interest capped at 3% per annum. If the tenancy is shorter, then, it has got to be paid during the term of the tenancy.</p><p>For commercial properties, the maximum amount of arrears that can be paid in instalments, will be five months’ base rent. For industrial and office properties, the maximum amount of arrears that can be paid in instalments will be four months’ base rent.</p><p>This means that landlords take on some credit risk. As a safeguard, we will provide that all outstanding arrears, including interest and other charges, will be accelerated and immediately payable in accordance with the terms of the original contract, if instalment payments under the scheme are not paid within the prescribed time after they become due; or if the tenant terminates or repudiates his lease agreement during the rescheduled repayment period; or if the lease agreement is terminated due to other defaults by the tenant.&nbsp;</p><p>Landlords may also draw the existing security deposits to offset accumulated rental arrears during the repayment period. They may do so, until there is the equivalent of at least one month of rent remaining in the security deposit.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the repayment period, the tenant will be obliged to reinstate the security deposit, as provided in the contract.</p><p>In addition, we will require tenant who have rescheduled the payment of arrears, to provide specified documents and information to their landlords if the lease agreement is: one, terminated or repudiated during the repayment period; and two, there are two or more rescheduled repayment instalments outstanding.</p><p>The documents and information to be provided will include filing a statutory declaration on their statement of accounts from April 2020 until the termination or repudiation of the licence. The tenant will also be required to set out how he proposes to repay the outstanding rental arrears.</p><p>This will ensure transparency and accountability, but only in respect of tenants who terminate and have at least two months of the repayments instalments outstanding.</p><p>If any criminal behaviour is revealed – for example, if the tenant was using the period of relief to fraudulently dissipate assets – then there could be criminal sanctions. Tenants will also be expected to negotiate in good faith the terms of repayment.</p><p>Any Court, when deciding whether the conduct is criminal, will likely take into account the totality of the conduct.</p><p>We have also heard concerns from the REITs about potential constraints on their operating income and cashflow. REITs are concerned that they may be liable for additional tax and that their abilities to meet financial covenants in bank loan agreements could be affected. They also worry that this could have a knock-on impact on S-REIT investors and the S-REIT industry as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>We discussed this matter carefully with MOF, IRAS, MAS, the banks. MOF and IRAS have temporarily extended timelines for the distribution of taxable income by S-REITs to qualify for tax transparency treatment. Leverage limits for S-REITs have also been increased from 45% to 50%. This will give S-REITs more flexibility to manage their cash flows and prevent them from incurring additional tax expenses.</p><p>Corporate landlords, which include S-REITs, can also approach their banks or finance companies to explore funding if they face cashflow issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Banks have also assured MAS that there will be no automatic enforcement of loan covenant breaches for landlords impacted by the requirements under this Bill.</p><p>Besides cash-flow difficulties, what has been happening in the industry is that people face difficulties in a variety of other ways. For example, take tenants whose tenancies expired or were expiring during circuit breaker period who had difficulties moving out because they were not allowed to go back to the office or shop to pack up or they could not find any movers or they are delayed because they cannot find workers to carry out the work, to put the place back to the original condition.</p><p>In such cases, it would be unfair for the tenant to have to pay double rent or similar charges under the contract or the law. The Bill allows us to deal with these situations, through subsidiary legislation.</p><p>We will provide that a tenant who cannot vacate the premises due to COVID-19 may serve an NFR under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. And the tenant will be protected from enforcement. In addition, the tenant will not be liable for double rent.</p><p>In some situations, it might be fair for the tenant to pay some amount, especially if the tenant continued to derive benefit from the premises. We will prescribe the circumstances and how that amount can be assessed.</p><p>Finally, we have also received feedback that stoppage of construction work has led to difficulties. There are also difficulties with supply-related contracts. These difficulties have also been caused to contracting parties, who may not themselves be parties to a construction or supply contract.</p><p>For example, a developer who has entered into a contract to fit out an office may be unable to do so within the timeline stipulated in the contract because of COVID-19 restrictions on construction work. That would expose the developer to liquidated damages for failure to deliver the fitted out office on time, through no fault of the developer.&nbsp;</p><p>The second example, say the tenant has entered into a tenancy agreement which provides for a three-month rent-free period for the purposes of renovation and fitting out, but is unable to proceed with construction works due to the COVID-19 restrictions, effectively losing the benefit of the rent-free period entirely.</p><p>The third example, a live example, a company, say Company A rents scaffolding materials from Company B, until 14 April for a project. When the circuit breaker kicked in on 7 April, Company A could not return scaffolding materials because of the circuit breaker. Company B says it is going to charge for an additional month of hiring fee.&nbsp;</p><p>In these cases, the affected parties are not parties to the construction contract but they are parties to contracts that are nevertheless affected by the stoppage in construction work or other circuit breaker measures.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bill therefore provides a mechanism for parties in some of these contracts to seek relief. They will be allowed to apply to an Assessor, who may then make a determination to either adjust the manner in which prescribed obligations are to be performed; or vary a prescribed term in a contract in order to achieve a just and equitable outcome.</p><p>The precise scope of contracts, the obligations to be covered and the kinds of adjustments that Assessors may make will be set out with more clarity in subsidiary legislation. A similar approach will be taken for supply related contracts.</p><p>Let me now quickly touch on some on the other amendments.</p><p>COVID 1 was passed and came into force in April this year. As of 1 June, we have had more than 4,000 Notifications for Relief and about 500 applications for determinations have been filed. During this period, we have observed that the operation of the Act has been effective. The fact that out of the 4,000 Notifications, only slightly more than 10% have come forward, suggests that most of the others had managed to settle it.</p><p>And because of the clarity of the previous Act, our understanding is that a lot of people have managed to deal with their issues along the lines provided for in the legislation without having to even file an NFR.</p><p>But we have been talking to the Assessors to get feedback on how it is working. So, we are making some clarificatory amendments.</p><p>For example, the information and matters disclosed in the course of proceedings before an Assessor, are to be kept confidential.</p><p>For late payment, payment arrears and interests that accumulate during the relief period under COVID 1, we will put a cap on how much late payment interest there can be. The cap will not apply to secured loan facilities given to SMEs, as well as hire purchase agreements taken out with banks and finance companies.</p><p>MAS has worked with banks and finance companies on various relief measures to support individuals and businesses affected by COVID-19. These measures include principal repayment deferments for SME secured loans and hire purchase agreements. Borrowers can also extend their loan tenure to spread out their loan repayments over a longer period.&nbsp;</p><p>Banks and finance companies will also take into account their borrowers’ repayment ability after the relief period and adjust repayment plans if necessary.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now conclude. The reliefs contained in this Bill will have substantial impact. All in all, up to 260,000 SMEs may benefit from the Government rental assistance. There are an estimated 31,000 SMEs in the F&amp;B and retail sectors. They, their employees will benefit from the additional relief that is being granted.&nbsp;</p><p>We are moving this Bill to help our SMEs. We hope that businesses will be able to make good use of the easing of pressure to focus on transforming and levelling up to thrive in our new operating environment. And a large number of office and industrial tenants will also benefit.</p><p>While it is unusual, let me conclude by saying a little about the process for preparing this Bill, which runs into about 40 pages or so. At first sight it looks simple enough: two months plus two months. But it is actually quite complex. Just to take one point: how do you pass down the waiver of rental relief through three or four layers of intermediate landlords? What happens if one of them is a non SME? And multiple questions of that sort. And when does it take effect? When would the landlords give the reliefs and to whom? And how do you handle the moratorium and the best balance between the different interests.</p><p>And the aspects relating to smaller landlords, REITs, the types of tenants who should qualify. And of course, the other contracts that should be dealt with in a myriad of situations.</p><p>It was a significant effort to conceptualise, crystallise, get the feedback from different stakeholders, take in the feedback and then, draft the legislation in about three weeks.</p><p>I saw the best of the Public Service: how different agencies came together, worked round the clock. MTI and ESG gave us the data which allowed us to work out where the balance ought to be, who ought to qualify. They attended all our meetings, including with stakeholders, helped to tweak our proposals and also worked their own loan schemes, and identified for us how the loan schemes may help.</p><p>MAS played a crucial role in re-assuring the REITs as well as the landlords, and talking to the banks. They also attended all the meetings, including stakeholder meetings. IRAS, MCCY, MHA, MND, HDB, JTC.</p><p>If I can say this – all roads lead to MOF and all roads lead from MOF as well. They attended all our meetings, very supportive, facilitated and agreed to pay for the bill.</p><p>The private sector lawyers: Patrick Ang and Sushil Nair. I mentioned them during COVID 1. They did a lot of work here as well. The Committee members – I will put it as part of the record of my speech without having to mention all of them. [<em>Please refer to </em><a href=\"/search/search/download?value=20200605/annex-Annex.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Annex 1</i></a><em>.</em>]</p><p>Different stakeholders, if I can put a note down for the exceptional team in MinLaw, they put their heart and soul into this, led by the Permanent Secretary and Deputy Secretary, a team of highly motivated and talented young officers, worked round the clock. And Justice Kannan Ramesh and his valuable expertise was very useful for us. And finally, AGC. The three lawyers: Lee Chuan Huei, Hema Subramanian and Leong Kit Yu who worked until 5.00 am regularly for the entire two weeks.</p><p>This legislation could not have been drafted in most places in three weeks, let alone conceptualise, crystallise and draft, led by our Attorney-General, Mr Lucien Wong.</p><p>I said some things about him during the Second Reading of COVID 1. I was trying to be understated. I think it helped tremendously that we had one of the best corporate lawyers in the world helping us from day one, word for word, conceptualising it, checking every word. I think Singapore is extremely fortunate to have him in Public Service. Checking everything and making sure that it works, and again, working into the early morning hours, every day. Attorney-Generals do not do that in most places. But it gave me a lot of confidence that he was doing that.</p><p>So, in this Bill, preparing it, we saw the best of the Public Service at work – coming together, working for the benefit of the broader public.</p><p>I wish to thank them and put on record their contributions.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>7.22 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, a main aim of this Bill is to support SMEs. SMEs are important to our economy. They are responsible for the employment of more than 70% of our country\\'s workforce, about two million workers.&nbsp;However, during the circuit breaker, many have been left with empty offices or shops that rack up rent, incurring costs. This does not account for other operating costs, such as manpower costs. Reducing the costs that SMEs face will in turn help them support their workers.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the main thrusts of the Bill is instituting rental waivers for SMEs, co-paid by the Government and the landlord. The period is four months for SME tenants at commercial properties for the months of April to July and two months for those in industrial and office properties for the months of April to May. This is good as it targets a significant expenditure many of our SMEs face and targets the period where SMEs are most adversely affected.</p><p>According to news reports, one important criterion is that there must be a 35% fall in average monthly revenue from April to May 2020 compared to the same period last year. Such targeted help is good. It is fairer that landlords not have to take haircuts if their tenants\\' revenues had not been adversely affected. Would the Minister clarify what happens if the company was a new company or a new tenant such that the comparison to the previous year is either impossible or is an inaccurate comparison?&nbsp;</p><p>Then, there is the landlord. From various news articles on this Bill, it looks to be that there is some distinction being drawn between large corporations and less large landlords through the use of the phrase \"financial hardship\". This is good as the considerations and ability to bear the \"pain\", so to speak, differs between smaller private landlords compared to large corporations. I would like to request of the Minister that a wide range of financial hardship should be considered as smaller landlords can also find themselves in vulnerable situations.&nbsp;</p><p>Just yesterday, Sir, 4 June 2020, I received an well-crafted email from a resident of Ulu Pandan. And I quote from that email, and this is to support the point that I am making about the need to differentiate between different types of landlords.&nbsp;</p><p>In that email, my resident wrote, \"Dear Mr de Souza,&nbsp;I hope this letter finds you well in these tough times.&nbsp;I would like to seek your advice regarding one of the Government\\'s new Bills, the one which would mandate a four-month rent free period for tenants, paid for equally by the Government and landlords. I would like to ask if the Government has any plans to differentiate between large landlords of significant capital reserves as compared to small family-owned companies.&nbsp;I am currently living on monthly rental revenue and honestly, I would not get to keep much of it after the banks take their due.&nbsp;It is my sincere wish that the Government would take into account of those in my position when discussing the proposed Bill.</p><p>Given the current economic situation, landlords in my position are already facing problems with rent collection as well as waivers and haircuts demanded by our tenants. To further absorb an additional two months of rent would be too much for many to bear. Of course, I begrudge not the tenants for their plight. COVID-19 is a natural and unexpected disaster that strikes at all levels of society. I just hope that they would try to understand that investing our savings into property should not entail a different treatment than those who invested in other forms of assets.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I am thankful of the Government’s courage and decisiveness in drawing down on reserves so as to combat these unprecedented financial challenges. In times of crisis, we as a society must come together and help our neighbours as best we can. I only hope that we would be allowed to contribute according to our means.\"</p><p>I spoke with my resident this morning before coming to Parliament over the phone and I said I would definitely raise his well-worded point of view in Parliament this afternoon.</p><p>Drawing from my resident\\'s message, the point I am making is this.</p><p>One, yes, I support the help given to tenants. Certainly. Two, the support is timely and needed. But three, we need a flexible system to differentiate between large corporate landlords and the landlords who have invested in small commercial shophouses and spaces as a form of, say, retirement income. It is for this reason that I am asking the Minister for \"financial hardship\" to be defined broadly and flexibly to strike the right balance, between the smaller landlords and the larger corporate landlords. And I hope the Minister would be able to expand on this request of mine in the good Minister\\'s reply.</p><p>Onto another point, Sir.&nbsp;It has been mentioned that direct monetary assistance previously rendered by the landlord to the tenant can be counted as part of the landlord\\'s contribution to rental waiver. Would the Minister clarify whether agreeing to lower the rent, and not waiving rent, is also considered direct monetary assistance? And if so, whether the rental waiver support from the Government and also the landlords\\' contribution to the rental waiver will be calculated based on rent pre-reduction or the newly agreed rent?&nbsp;</p><p>While the law has tried to strike a balance between the landlords and the tenants, it can only go so far in achieving an outcome that all parties will find mutually acceptable in the long-run. Landlords and tenants need each other and I hope that they will continue to have constructive discussions to support each other through this unprecedented crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>It was reported that landlords can apply for assessment as to whether the SME is eligible and that eligible tenants will be notified in due course. It may be in the words of the draft Bill, but would the tenant also have access to the mechanism of assessing whether one, the landlord is indeed one that faces financial hardship or two, whether or not they are indeed an eligible tenant.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides rental waivers, the Bill also provides for rental repayment schemes to allow rent to be repaid in installments instead. Would the Minister clarify as to whether eligibility of this rental repayment scheme depends on whether the tenant had previously defaulted pre-COVID-19 or not? Further, what will be done to ameliorate the knock-on effect such deferment has on private individual landlords who would face financial hardship owing to the lack of cashflow?&nbsp;</p><p>For tenants who are unable to move out, there is a change to the normal law of tenancy in saying that landlords will not get double rent for the period of holding over. Will the Minister clarify as to how this will interact with rental waivers?</p><p>I should mention, Mr Speaker, that I am an advocate in private practice and I sometimes do have to delve in landlord-tenant disputes – just wanted to put that on the record.</p><p>The second main thrust of the Bill is that relating to contracts other than rents. The Bill looks to cap late payment interest, charges for arrears and so on. I welcome the reduction and limitation of late payment interest as this will help reduce snowballing debt.&nbsp;</p><p>The last clarification I want to seek of the Minister is whether further adjustments will be made to the insolvency framework so that non-viable businesses can still exit smoothly. For example, where a business owner has made the hard decision to stop his trade in these times and seeks to venture into a new trade to overcome the difficult economic environment presented by the pandemic.</p><p>In conclusion, Sir, the MinLaw team, along with other Ministries and agencies such as the Attorney-General Chambers have thought out of the box and pushed through this exceptional legislation in double quick time, if not in triple quick time. Indeed, sanctity of contract and the avoidance of retrospective measures are what we should all aspire to to ensure the certainty of the bargain struck by two contracting parties. But, Sir, these are unprecedented times. MinLaw has acted swiftly. This Bill, if passed, will reduce the pain businesses are feeling. And if it can reduce retrenchments; if it can help keep wages from being cut or further cut; if it strikes the right balance between tenant and landlord, if it gives that needed life buoy, as we come out of the circuit breaker and into the gradual reopening of the economy, then I say the effort is worth it, and the Bill should be supported.</p><h6>7.33 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)</strong>: Mr Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic and the circuit breaker measures have had significant impact on businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last two months, I have received many appeals for assistance from my residents who are SME business owners as they are facing cashflow problems. The retail sector has been amongst the hardest hit as they have had to close their physical premises. While some of them have been able to move their business online, overall business still has been impacted. In the meantime, there are business costs and obligations still to be met and they still have to be paid.</p><p>The latest Department of Statistics data has also shown that in April there has been a dramatic drop in performance of 40.5% and this is the largest since 1986.&nbsp;</p><p>For many SMEs, rent is a large part of the business cost making up about 25% to 30% of overall business cost. Even as some businesses are able to start and reopen this week, they are not able to resume pre-COVID levels of operations immediately, and business demand will likely remain low.</p><p>The Bill seeks to help SMEs ease some of the burden by ensuring that their accumulated rental obligations are shared among the Government and landlords.&nbsp;</p><p>The interventions in the Bill are quite substantive as it mandates that landlords will have to waive rent for SME tenants. For eligible SME tenants in commercial properties, the landlords are required to waive two months of rent and tenants of industrial and office properties will receive one month’s waiver of rent. The Bill also requires landlords to pass the Government granted tax rebates in cash grants as part of the Fortitude Budget to the SME tenants.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bill does take a targeted approach and is reasonable. It does not apply across the board to all SMEs and businesses. Eligibility for the relief are for SMEs with less than $100 million turnover that rent premises for their businesses and are facing cashflow difficulties as a result of COVID-19. So, to be eligible, SMEs also have to fulfil two other criteria of a 35% or more drop in average monthly revenue from April to May on a year-on-year basis, and the tenancy must have been entered before March 25 of this year</p><p>Landlords are also not required to help larger SME tenants who may have better access to financing or tenants who have seen an increase in business during the period such as supermarkets.</p><p>Can Minister share if there has been an assessment of whether the rental relief measures will unnecessarily prolong the exit of unviable businesses, or benefit such businesses at the cost of landlords and taxpayers’ monies?</p><p>The rental reliefs do weigh in favour of tenants. At this point, I do want to declare my interest as I am a board member of a commercial REIT. Minister did mention that other stakeholders, including landlords and REITs, have been consulted. Minister has also shared that some of the views and concerns of these stakeholders who have been impacted are being addressed? For example, the cashflow difficulties that have been expressed as well as the measures and mechanisms are being put in place to support these landlords.&nbsp;</p><p>While I am supportive of this amendment Bill, I am concerned that landlords may face financial hardship as a result of the additional rental waiver they have to provide to SME tenants.&nbsp;For some of the smaller landlords, they may be dependent on the rental income to meet their own financial obligations.&nbsp;</p><p>The Bill does state that for landlords who face difficulties in providing the additional waiver to SME tenants, it does provide some reprieve. The landlords though will still have&nbsp;– if they are eligible for that reprieve&nbsp;– will still have to pay half of that obligation. And the landlords if they seek assessments on grounds of financial hardship, the assessments will take into consideration if the rental income forms a substantial part of their total income and the annual value of their properties. Is that how it is going to be assessed? And can Minister also share the assessment process and also how long that would take?&nbsp;</p><p>SMEs play a crucial role in Singapore’s economy making up a majority of companies and do provide employment for more than two million Singaporeans. So I do agree that SME tenants do need support during these tough times as they have been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The rental reliefs will allow the SMEs the space to recover and in turn save jobs. So, I support the Bill.</p><h6>7.39 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I join the hon Members who spoke before me to support the amendment Bill.</p><p>The hon Minister for Law took pains to outline the exceptional circumstances warranting intervention in the area of rent payable by SMEs as an exception against the principle of sanctity of contract. I fully agree with him. We are dealing with survival of SME tenants that employ a substantial number of Singaporeans. We cannot afford to just depend on each individual landlord to determine what concessions should be granted to the tenants’ whose businesses are massively haemorrhaging. Such actions would be too slow and uneven and livelihoods will be at stake.</p><p>I must however acknowledge and commend the actions of a good number of landlords who took unilateral action to help the tenants.&nbsp;For these landlords, I am glad to note that the amendment Bill is worded in a way that would take into account what these landlords unilaterally have done in assessing what further relief should be given by them to these tenants. Whilst small businesses will be the immediate beneficiaries under the amendment Bill, in the long run, as hon Minister mentioned, this amendment Bill actually protects the landlord’s interest too because it will ensure that the tenant’s market will not collapse. So, just like COVID 1, this should not be seen as an anti-landlord bill.</p><p>Before moving on, I would like to applaud the consultation undertaken by the officers of MinLaw and all the other Government agencies that the hon Minister mentioned in coming up with this Bill. They worked, in the words of the hon Member Mr Christoper de Souza, \"triple time\" in taking consultation from the ground, identifying the big bug bear that SMEs have and providing concrete solutions through this Bill.</p><p>Turning to the amendment Bill, I seek clarification on three areas and will end with a suggestion.</p><p>First, on the benefits that the sub-tenants will get under the amendment Bill. As I recall, during the Second Reading of COVID 1, the hon Minister for National Development, Mr Lawrence Wong stated that tenants are not mandated to pass on property tax rebate to sub-tenants. He explained that the reason for not mandating this is because, in his words, “there is a whole range of commercial arrangements” and there is no contractual relationship between the property owner and sub-tenant.</p><p>As I understand, the Government under this Bill is prepared to pay cash grant to sub-tenants if they are in possession of the properties. If the sub-tenants do not get the flow through of the benefit of the property tax rebate, based on my understanding, they will get a lower amount than the tenants in possession. Will this also affect the rebate that these sub-tenants get from their landlord? Because as I understand from the hon Minister\\'s speech, the Government&nbsp;– for commercial tenants&nbsp;– will give two months\\' rental rebate and then the landlords will follow up with two months. There is a bit of a principle of reciprocity in action. So, will this affect what the sub-tenant will get?</p><p>Next, on clause 7 of the Amendment Bill, I note that it is proposed that a tenant who is holding over a property after the expiry of a tenancy owing to a COVID-19 event will not be liable to the landlord. I welcome this amendment. It makes eminent sense to provide such relief. The control measures in place would make it difficult for the tenant to vacate premises, restore the property to its original state and yield vacant possession to the landlord.</p><p>May I ask whether there is a corollary provision to protect the landlord who may have a back-to-back arrangement with a new tenant under which he has to deliver vacant possession on the original due date? Such tenants may not be able to rely on COVID 1 if they entered into this lease after the trigger dates. For example, if they enter into the lease after 25 of March 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;In this regard, I note that in the amendment Bill, a Part 8 is proposed to provide relief to parties to downstream contracts affected by delay in performance or breach of a construction contract, supply contract or related contract. It does not appear that Part 8 applies to leases.</p><p>If my understanding is correct, may I please ask why leases, or for that matter, all the other scheduled contracts are excluded? As a matter of policy, I think it would have been better if parties in affected contracts that suffer a knock on effect arising from the application of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act on scheduled contracts should also have recourse under this Act.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, I note that in addition to the rental relief, the Amendment Bill also provides for a statutory repayment schedule for accumulated rental arrears commencing from the month of November 2020 in equal installments. I support this additional measure. The hon Minister refers to this as the third plank.&nbsp;I further note that the landlords will not be able to charge contractual interest beyond the prescribed rate on the outstanding rent. This makes sense as it would otherwise whittle the effect of the rental reliefs that are being provided under this amendment Bill.</p><p>The hon Minister mentioned that the prescribed rate is no more than 3% per annum. May I please ask the basis upon which this 3% interest rate is arrived at and also, what would be the applicable time period for this interest rate to run?</p><p>Finally, a suggestion. The hon Minister mentioned that potentially 260,000 SMEs may be beneficiaries under this amendment Bill once passed. May I please ask how would they be made aware of the reliefs under this amendment Bill so that they would be able to take advantage of these measures and keep their businesses alive.&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Minister Shanmugam.</p><h6>7.47 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>: I thank the Members for speaking, for expressing their support for this Bill. Mr&nbsp;Pillai asked for clarification on what a sub-tenant gets under the rental waiver and he pointed out that Minister Lawrence Wong had said during COVID 1 that the Bill did not mandate for the rebate to flow to the sub-tenant.</p><p>Let me clarify that the Government\\'s intention has always been for the businesses that have actually been impacted by COVID-19 to benefit from this Government assistance. In some cases, the businesses may be sub-tenants. Minister Lawrence Wong, at that time, said, \"the Government strongly urges and encourages all master tenants to pass on the savings from the rebate to their sub-tenants and to share the burdens during this time of uncertainty and difficulty.\"</p><p>Minister Lawrence also explained that mandating further passing on of the rebates is difficult and complex because of the nature of the relationships that can arise. This is why, in my opening speech, I said this is actually quite a complex issue. But we studied it and we decided that the complexity can be solved and can be dealt with. And that is why, here we are mandating it.</p><p>What we decided to do was not only enhance the Government assistance but also put in place a framework that ensures that the assistance reaches the intended beneficiaries who are the actual company or business that is using the premises for business. Conceptually, how this works is – to answer Mr Pillai\\'s specific question&nbsp;– the Bill does not require cash to move from the Government to the property owner to the actual tenant or sub-tenant. What it does is put in place a framework of rental waivers mandated by law.&nbsp;</p><p>Given this mechanism, the concern that is raised on behalf of subtenants not getting the two months of rental waiver does not arise. We did it very carefully and specifically because if you require the money to be passed down, then there can be all sorts of arguments as to who it would pass down to, when was it passed down and so on. But by law, we are saying that rental is not payable. So, that is a very different proposition. Automatically, the subtenant does not have to pay his intermediate landlord, and the intermediate landlord does not have to pay the ultimate landlord. What each of those in between might lose is that mark-up.</p><p>So, the number of months of rental waiver a tenant will get does not depend on whether he is the tenant or sub-tenant. Everyone will get two months on this waiver mechanism. We will set that out very clearly in subsidiary legislation. IRAS will give a notification of cash grant to the owner of the premises because the owner of the premises has already received the money, everyone else does not have to pay rental. It is actually conceptually cleaner and neater.</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza asked about cases where an SME is a new company, which makes comparison to the previous year impossible or inaccurate. That is another complexity which we did think about.</p><p>First of all, the reason why the same period of time was taken for a year-on-year comparison – it is a fairly normal thing and we did it to avoid seasonal fluctuations in revenue. But where the tenants were not operational during the April to May 2019 period, we will choose another best appropriate period that will reflect whether the tenant\\'s performance has been impacted by COVID-19. That, again, will be in subsidiary legislation.&nbsp;For leases and licences that are even shorter, we will also work out the criteria.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza asked whether landlords who agreed to lower the rent will be able to set off the deduction against the rental waivers that they must provide. We want to be careful. The rental waivers by landlords will be calculated based on base rent payable by the tenant for the applicable period. Landlords will be allowed to set off any direct monetary assistance that they have already given against the rental waiver that they are required to provide. Or if they have already provided rental waiver, of course, they can take that into account.&nbsp;The types of assistance from landlords that will be considered direct monetary assistance under the Act will also be prescribed.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Jessica Tan asked about who the Assessors will be, the process for seeking assessment and the estimated timelines. A panel of Assessors, professionals, a fair number of legal and accounting professionals&nbsp;– they have already been appointed. More will be appointed to consider applications for assessments by landlords. With regard to timelines, we will make the process as simple as we can. We have made it very simple under COVID 1. The actual time taken for determinations to be made depends very much on the parties themselves and whether they adhere to the timelines. But, we will make them short and fast.</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza asked whether tenants will have access to the assessment mechanism either to challenge the landlord\\'s assertion of financial hardship or to ascertain whether they are eligible.</p><p>The criteria for landlords facing financial hardship as well as the tenants\\' eligibility will be objective. As for tenants, it will be IRAS which will make the assessment. If the landlord wants to challenge that, he can. If the tenant wants to challenge the landlord\\'s assertion of financial hardship, which will again be based on annual value of the property and what proportion of the rental income forms part of his total annual income, they will be allowed to challenge.</p><p>Mr Pillai asked how we arrived at the 3% cap on interest in the repayment schedule and when it starts accruing. The 3% interest is comparable to the median rate of secured bank loans in April 2020 and takes into consideration the landlords\\' cost of capital with property as security. We are aware that some landlords\\' cost of capital could be higher than 3% but this rate is intended to strike a balance between the needs of landlords who have their own financial obligations, and the tenants who do face significant challenges repaying their rental obligations under these fairly extraordinary circumstances.</p><p>Interest at that cap rate will apply from the time that the rent was originally due and payable but the rent and interest will only be payable in accordance to the repayment schedule. Interest at that cap rate will continue during the schedule repayment period until the arrears are paid off.&nbsp;To be clear as well, only arrears that accrue from 1 February 2020 until 19 October 2020 can be repaid under this repayment schedule.</p><p>Mr Murali Pillai referred to clause 7 on the relief for tenants who are unable to vacate their premises after the expiry of lease because of COVID-19. He asked about whether there is a corollary provision to protect the landlords who have a back-to-back arrangement, with a new tenant to deliver vacant possession by a certain date. This is why I said this legislation is not simple, though it looks simple at first glance. There are many related contracts that need to be thought through and we have provided for it. The landlord can serve a&nbsp;Notification for Relief&nbsp;on the new tenant. We imposed the rules that for those two months, there can be no work; and if there is a knock-on effect, that has got to be taken into account.</p><p>So, the landlord can tell the new tenant he cannot deliver vacant possession on time and the new tenant cannot terminate the lease on that ground. This will give the landlord and the new tenant time to work out a compromise. If they cannot agree, they can apply to an Assessor who will make a determination to reach a just and equitable outcome.</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza asked about the interaction between this relief and the rental waivers. There is non interaction. The rental waivers&nbsp;apply to the period during which the tenancy subsists. Holding over or double rent&nbsp;is only relevant when the tenancy has already ended and is not subsisting.</p><p>Mr Murali asked about whether leases are covered under Part 8. Part 8 may apply to all contracts that may be affected by an upstream delay in construction, except those which may be prescribed. Some contracts will be excluded.&nbsp;</p><p>We are looking&nbsp;at categories that should be excluded. For example, employment contracts should never be subject to these sorts of laws.&nbsp;But we also take the approach that only contracts which are actually written in, will be affected by the law as well and that will be gazetted.</p><p>Ms Jessica Tan asked&nbsp;if I could share how we have addressed the concerns of other affected stakeholders besides tenants and she mentioned that she is on the board of a REIT.&nbsp;We consulted landlords, bigger landlords as well as smaller landlords, we consulted REITs, we consulted business people and of course, we had substantial assistance from MTI, ESG, MOF, MND, MAS, bankers and so on.</p><p>So, in the process of formulating these measures, we consulted all of them. We held engagements with all of them, got their views, we actually took substantive feedback and amended, adjusted our proposals where we thought that we ought to do so. We could not take all the suggestions. You will see, as I have set out in the opening speech for the Second Reading, how we have come in to help the REITs, the landlords as well as the tenants, some by MinLaw, some by MAS talking to the banks, and some by IRAS and others, waiving some rules, amending them to help the REITs, for example.</p><p>Mr Christopher de Souza mentioned&nbsp;that some distinction should be made&nbsp;between large corporate landlords,&nbsp;and smaller landlords who may themselves be facing financial hardship. We considered this carefully. We considered the factors that should be taken into account as to when landlords should considered to be unable to provide the additional rental waiver. We think that the two factors to be taken into account are the annual value of their properties and the proportion the rental forms of the landlord\\'s total income. This will allow us to distinguish between larger landlords&nbsp;and those who are heavily dependent on rental income for their livelihoods. The precise proportions, percentages will be set out in subsidiary legislation.</p><p>Mr Murali Pillai asked about the steps&nbsp;the Government is taking&nbsp;to ensure that those who are eligible for the rental reliefs are aware of this. I would say, I think businesses who need relief would be very aware of this legislation. In fact, they are waiting for it. We have had a fair bit of publicity. It was in Deputy Prime Minister\\'s Statement last week. MinLaw has put it out. I would be very surprised if anyone who qualifies is, at this point in time, not aware that they are going to get some benefits. We will put it out as much as we can. And IRAS will notify property owners who have eligible tenants and the property owners will have to notify their tenants and sub-tenants as well.</p><p>Ms Jessica Tan asked&nbsp;whether the rental relief measures&nbsp;would unnecessarily prolong&nbsp;the exit of unviable businesses, or benefit such businesses&nbsp;at the cost of landlords and taxpayers’ monies. This is a very serious and important, fundamental question which more than troubled me and was front and centre in my consideration in deciding whether or not to intervene. Because we need to help but it cannot become a crutch and it cannot be such that unviable businesses, therefore, continue because we are using taxpayers\\' money.</p><p>So, the starting principle, I would say is this. It is fairness. When&nbsp;we have imposed the circuit breaker rules for two months telling businesses not to operate, then I think we ought to give relief for that period. If we accept that COVID-19 was an exceptional event, then we ought to legislate for that as well in that whether it is viable or unviable, that is something that no one could have predicted.</p><p>Second, the risk is not so much looking at unviable businesses but looking at viable businesses. Even perfectly viable businesses, given the kind of hit that I have pointed out – 60% drop in turnover in April and probably as bad if not more for May – viable businesses will go down, their employees will go down, people will lose a lot of money. That is our focus. So, I would say it is not as if we are asking them to get down to a cruise liner and everyone is going to be saved. We are throwing them a lifeline of a few months rental waiver.</p><p>But the seas are still rough because Phase Two, it is not as if immediately, business is going to go back to normal. And then Phase Three, how many people are going to go out? How many people are going to spend money? What about the safe distancing measures? In a restaurant, how many can sit? So, business conditions are going to be tough. The seas are going to be rough. People would have to swim very hard. So, it will only be the very fit, the viable businesses that will survive that period even with the relief that we are giving. And none of us knows how long this will last.</p><p>In addition to the measures already taken under COVID 1, we are also considering measures to assess certain micro and small businesses which may need help in winding up or where appropriate, with debt restructuring. But that is a larger piece of work. It is still work-in-progress and we do it when we can do it. This answers Mr de Souza\\'s question on whether the Government has any plans to make further adjustments to the insolvency framework so that non-viable businesses that need to exit are able to do so smoothly.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I think I have covered all the questions. I thank again those who have contributed to this effort.

This means a well-balanced diet with sufficient intake of fluids, adequate physical activity, as well as having enough sleep and rest.

Before residents are allowed to resume work, all parties, including dormitory operators, employers and workers, are required to implement safe management and safe living measures to ensure migrant workers work and live in a safe environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Besides implementing safe management measures to prepare for the re-opening of workplaces, employers are also required to cooperate with the dormitory operators to facilitate the testing and clearing of their workers in the dormitories. These include confirming and updating the addresses of their workers in the Online Foreign Worker Address Service (OFWAS) and working with the dormitory operators stagger pick-up and drop-off time and provide dedicated transport for their workers to and from the workplaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Dormitory operators are required to implement safe living measures to minimise the risk of transmissions in the dormitories. These measures include tracking the entry and exit of residents and visitors in and out of the dormitories, limiting the inter-mixing of residents such as by staggering the use of common facilities, and strengthening the health surveillance of dormitory residents to identify residents who display symptoms of infection and isolate them quickly. In addition, we are working with the dormitory operators to progressively reduce the density of the existing dormitories by re-housing workers in the new temporary dormitories as they come online. This will allow the existing dormitories to provide more living space per resident to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases in the dormitories.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, workers also have an important role to play to ensure that rules for communal living are complied with.&nbsp;For example, they are responsible to monitor their health conditions daily, abide by the rules set up by the dormitory operators to minimise physical interactions with residents from other blocks, and promptly report to their dormitory operators and employers if they are feeling unwell.&nbsp;</p><p>To help employers and dormitory operators to understand and implement these measures effectively, MOM has provided relevant advisories and checklists and conducted briefings for the dormitory operators. To help foreign workers better understand their responsibilities, we have produced simple communications materials, such as infographics, in the workers’ key native languages for employers and dormitory operators to educate their workers and residents with. We have also tapped on mobile applications for foreign workers and foreign worker ambassadors from the Migrant Workers' Centre to reach out to the workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides engagement and outreach efforts, there will be penalties and consequences on each party if they do not do their part.&nbsp;Employers who fail to fulfil their responsibilities may be fined up to $10,000 or jailed up to 12 months, or both under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). They may also be debarred from employing foreign workers.&nbsp;</p><p>Dormitory operators who fail to put in place safe living measures at the dormitories can face a fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment term of up to 12 months, or both, per contravention. Operators licensed under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act (FEDA) may also have their operating licence revoked. Private property owners or landlords who have not complied with these measures will not be allowed to rent out their properties or flats to foreign workers.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure that workers comply with the safe living measures in the dormitories, dormitory operators are to set clear house rules and corresponding consequences for non-compliance. All cases of non-compliance have to be reported to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).&nbsp;Workers who repeatedly breach house rules pose a risk to others and may have their work passes revoked.&nbsp;</p>\",\n",

This is an additional precaution that MOM has introduced proactively, to track the payment of salaries to foreign workers to intervene early in cases where salaries are owed. We also required employers to pay salaries electronically to ensure that workers can receive their salaries even if they are unable to leave the dormitories.</p><p>The vast majority of employers contacted declared to MOM that they would pay April 2020 salaries electronically.

The corrosion is caused by moisture and acids in the concrete which can build up over time.

For imports of food, SFA imposes control measures that are calibrated based on the assessed food safety risks. Importers must be licensed, and apply for import permits for each consignment of food imported into Singapore, which facilitates food traceability and recalls if any food safety infringements are found. SFA also conducts regular food safety inspections and testing of the end product to ensure that food sold in Singapore complies with our food safety standards and requirements.</p><p>Such control measures are applied to the import and slaughter of turtle for food in Singapore. Approximately 95% of all the turtles, including wild-caught soft shell turtles, which are imported for food are slaughtered and processed into meat products at a SFA-licensed local slaughterhouse, with the remaining live turtles being distributed to the four wet market stallholders within one market for sale. Given that the food safety and disease transmission risk associated with the import, slaughter and sale of turtles is low, SFA does not test for diseases in imported turtles which are sold live. Nevertheless, as part of SFA’s inspection regime, SFA conducts random sampling and testing of turtle meat products, including those from the SFA-licensed slaughterhouse, for foodborne pathogens such as Shigella species and Vibrio cholerae (pronounced as vee-brio collar-rae).</p><p>Over the past five years, SFA has collected a total of 63 samples of turtle meat products and conducted 129 laboratory tests on these samples. All test results showed that the samples met SFA's food safety and hygiene requirements with no foodborne pathogens detected. Thus far, there have not been any foodborne outbreaks associated with the consumption of turtles.</p><p>In line with ongoing efforts to improve public health and environmental hygiene standards in Singapore, SFA will continue to be vigilant in its inspection regime and tighten requirements for food safety when necessary. However, the assurance of food safety is a joint responsibility across the industry, consumers and the Government. To prevent foodborne illnesses, food handlers and consumers should also observe good food safety and hygiene practices, such as the washing of hands with soap and water before and after handling any raw meat, and by thoroughly cooking the meat, which helps to kill any harmful bacteria.</p>\",\n",

anticipation of the increase in claims since the start of the circuit breaker, MOM has strengthened the support to both employees and employers to resolve end-of-employment disputes. Where employees have filed wrongful dismissal claims, a good number have been due to the abrupt manner of termination rather than unfair terms – most employers have fulfilled their contractual obligations. With the complainants\\' agreement, we refer them to Workforce Singapore or e2i for employment facilitation.&nbsp;</p><p>We recognise that this is a period of unusual stress for employers and employees alike.&nbsp;Regardless of their business circumstances, all employers should carry out termination of employment contracts fairly, responsibly and sensitively. They must continue to adhere to employment laws, contractual terms, and the relevant tripartite advisories.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Employees are also encouraged to engage their employers to seek clarity on issues of concern.&nbsp;Where there are irresponsible practices by employers, MOM will investigate and take enforcement actions as necessary.</p>',\n",

In the initial month of implementation, a very small number of employers were unable to do so, due to technical or administrative issues. For example, their workers' bank account applications were still pending approval by the bank. In these cases, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) allowed the employers to continue to pay outstanding salaries in cash.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to its urgent necessity, this new requirement was introduced at very short notice. Nevertheless, the vast majority of employers have complied. MOM will continue to follow up and remind the remaining employers to make the switch if they have not already done so, especially now that circuit breaker measures have been lifted. MOM will in due course take enforcement action against non-compliance, as it would for other conditions under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.</p>\",\n",
