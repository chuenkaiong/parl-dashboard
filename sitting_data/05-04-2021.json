We will continue our efforts to encourage the take-up of the vaccine. Vaccination is free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents. We have expanded the number of vaccination centres to 31 today and there will be a total of 40 vaccination centres islandwide by mid-April, so that individuals can be conveniently vaccinated near their home or place of work.</p><p>Our supply of vaccines remains limited by the ability of vaccine manufacturers to deliver, given the high levels of global demand. This has resulted in limited booking slots in recent days. I apologise for the inconvenience caused to those who have not been able to book earlier. As more supplies arrive, we will progressively open more slots.</p><p>We have had to prioritise our vaccinations, starting with our healthcare workers, vulnerable elderly and those involved in COVID-19 operations. The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination had also recommended that we prioritise those personnel whose job roles are of critical importance to the functioning of Singapore and are at higher risk of exposure to and onward transmission of COVID-19. This is critical to ensure that key sectors would be able to continue functioning effectively even during a local outbreak, and further reduce risks to our vulnerable populations and the community at large. Such personnel include those involved in safeguarding our borders and maintaining law and order, those involved in the provision of utilities such as water, energy and telecommunications services, workers who ensure the supply of essential food items, and land transport workers involved in ensuring that our transport services are kept running.&nbsp;</p><p>Religious workers might also face potential risks as they may engage in regular and non-transient contact with worshipers and devotees, including the elderly and vulnerable. Older religious workers, aged 45 and above, are already eligible for vaccination. Religious workers are also required to comply with safe management measures in the conduct of religious services and in other engagements with worshippers or devotees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We continue to make steady progress with our vaccination programme. As of 3 April 2021, around 1.52 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered. Around 1.05 million individuals have received at least one dose of the vaccine, of which more than 468,000 individuals have received their second dose and completed the full vaccination regimen.</p><p>To date, about 60% of eligible seniors aged 70 and above, and close to 70% of eligible seniors aged 60 to 69 have received the COVID-19 vaccination or booked their vaccination appointments.</p><p>We have recently invited citizens and residents aged 45 to 59 to begin to register for their vaccinations and close to 500,000, or about half, had done so. We are encouraged by the strong response. Those who have registered will progressively receive invitations through SMS to make appointments for their vaccination. This may take some time given the number of people who have registered. To date, about 17% of eligible individuals have received the vaccination or booked their appointments and we expect the rest should receive the SMS by the middle of May and they can expect a booking slot by early June.</p><p>We thank everybody for their patience.</p><p>People under the age of 45 have also been patiently waiting for their turn. Based on current schedule, we plan to begin inviting them in June to book their slots. If all goes well, we will complete the vaccination programme as scheduled by the end of the year.</p><p>Some members of the public may wish to receive their vaccination early for a variety of reasons. Since 16 March, we have opened up an appeals channel for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who need to travel overseas on compassionate grounds, for employment or study purposes. Applicants will need to meet certain criteria. These are listed on www.vaccine.gov.sg/appeal. They will need to submit sufficient documentation to support their appeal. We will prioritise appeals with earlier travel dates if they are able to complete the two-dose regimen prior to departure.</p><p>Close to 98% of those who booked appointments for COVID-19 vaccinations in the last 30 days have showed up for their appointments. We estimate that about 1% of those who turned up were rejected because of concerns about allergies and contra-indications. We encourage everyone to be vaccinated when your turn comes and to turn up at the vaccination appointments that you have made so that you do not deny another person the opportunity.</p><p>However, such cases do not result in vaccine wastage. We closely monitor the appointment bookings and historical take-up rate, and deliver the appropriate number of vaccine doses to the vaccination sites. Unopened vials can be stored at the vaccination sites for at least three days. Vaccination site providers will start a new vial only when they have checked that there are individuals awaiting vaccination, to avoid vaccine wastage. At the end of the day, to utilise any balance remaining in a multi-dose vial and further minimise wastage, there are pre-planned lists of individuals who will be invited to be vaccinated. These could be staff who are working at the vaccination sites or frontline volunteers who have an active role in engaging seniors on vaccinations.</p><p>As with other established vaccines, people who receive the COVID-19 vaccine may experience common side effects, such as pain at the injection site and fatigue. Should the side effects persist or get worse after a few days, they should see a doctor and seek medical attention.</p><p>In very rare cases, the COVID-19 vaccine can cause a severe allergic reaction, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of face, throat, eyes or lips, a fast heartbeat, dizziness and weakness or a bad rash all over the body. In the event of a severe allergic reaction, please call 995 or visit the nearest hospital immediately.</p><p>Members of the public can also visit www.vaccine.gov.sg or the MOH website to further understand the post-vaccination symptoms.</p><p>MOH will be conducting further studies to monitor and review the extent and duration of immunity provided by the COVID-19 vaccines. This includes collecting selected post-vaccination samples from groups such as healthcare workers, frontline staff and seniors, to monitor the persistence of antibodies up to 24 months. Currently, in line with international practices, there are no plans to test the serology of everyone who is vaccinated in Singapore. We will share more details about the studies once they are completed.</p><p>Vaccination is a key enabler to reduce the risk of community transmission and allow more economic and community activities to resume. As more vaccine stocks arrive, we will continue to expand our vaccination programme to more segments of the population, so that all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore will have the chance to be vaccinated by end-2021.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Ms Foo Mee Har.</p><p><strong>\tMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast)</strong>: Thank you, Speaker. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State for Health two supplementary questions. The first is, the Senior Minister of State did explain about the measures taken to minimise wastage but I would nevertheless like to ask whether a standby system can be arranged to allow those who are not yet eligible for vaccination but willing to wait on standby basis at vaccination centres, to take the place of those who did not turn up, assuming the frontline people and volunteers have already had their turn. So, whether a standby system can be arranged for those who are willing, as it will take to the end of the year for the rest of the population to get their jab.</p><p>The second question relates to prioritising vaccination candidates. Would mosque staff and volunteers involved in additional night prayers during the holy month of Ramadan be considered to be at increased risk of infection, given that they are expected to serve at least 250 congregants a day?</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the suggestion for a standby system. We will continue to study how best to deal with the challenges of prioritising those most at risk, those who have some urgent need and having some equitable distribution across our population, even as we try to cover as many people as possible before the end of the year. But we will study her suggestion.</p><p>The point she makes about the prioritisation for workers in certain religious settings highlights the need for continued safe management measures and vigilance from everybody involved. But if there are specific individuals who might have particularly high risks, we will look at their situation and try our best to accommodate.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><p><strong>\tMs Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I have two sets of clarification for the Senior Minister of State. First of all, could he confirm that there has actually been a change in the advice given to certain groups of people who initially were considered to be ineligible or asked to defer their vaccinations. By that, I mean in the initial stages of the online screening, people were asked whether they had allergies and whether they suffered from certain conditions, but I think there is now new advice given that these people who were originally considered not eligible, actually can take the vaccination. So, I would like him to confirm that there has been an update or a change in those instructions.</p><p>And in that light, first, has the online screening been modified so that we do not exclude people who can actually take the vaccination; and secondly, are we catching up on those who were deemed to have failed the online screening initially but now with further scientific evidence they are actually eligible to take the vaccination? How are we catching up with those people?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Ms Lim is correct; indeed, the advice has shifted. It is severe anaphylactic reactions that we are most concerned about. And as an increasing number of people has been vaccinated, we have confidence over the situations in which someone previously thought to be ineligible might now go forward and have the vaccine.&nbsp;Indeed, the online systems and our various guidance to people manning counters and hotlines has changed.</p><p>The way in which we are catching up is that the citizens involved remain as part of our patients, the patients of the healthcare providers, the vaccine system will continue to track this process. Most people are able to go forward and complete the vaccination. If there are individuals who have been deemed ineligible, I would reinforce that this is about deferring the appointment and the consultation to a time where they might subsequently become eligible. We will continue to pay close attention to this segment of the population.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Murali Pillai (Bukit Batok)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the hon Senior Minister of State for his answer to my Parliamentary Question. I understand that he mentioned that the Government does not intend to measure the antibody levels of persons as it stands now. May I please ask the reasons for this, given that, at least amongst some quarters, the understanding is that the effectiveness of the vaccination may peter out after several months? Also, would there not be a need to guard against variants and, in particular, the effect of this vaccination against variants?</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his questions. As I have mentioned, we are studying the matter of antibody levels. I think before we make a decision about how we would look at what is happening in the population, let us, first, do those studies.</p><p>For most vaccinations previously, that has not been the approach to go with a population-wide antibody assay. It is also logistically very difficult and would place a burden on our population. So, we need to be sure that it is useful and necessary before we would do such a thing.</p><p>However, with the issue of variants, assaying a set of antibodies to a prior vaccination is not going to be necessarily useful to inform the clinical risk for a new variant that perhaps was not there when the vaccination was delivered.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I think there are two separate issues&nbsp;– the issue of virus variants is being closely studied by our experts as well as international experts; and the matter of if, when and whether we should be doing serology and antibody testing is also being studied. So, let us complete those studies before we make any decision on that basis.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Two quick questions for the Senior Minister of State. Given the diversity of vaccines that will eventually be deployed, I am wondering if there has been any effort by the Government in persuading take-up based on specific types of vaccines. I am thinking, in particular, certain of my elderly residents may have a preference, for instance, for the Sinovac versus mRNA vaccines.&nbsp;</p><p>Related to this, the second question is whether the Ministry will actually have a threshold target for coverage associated with herd immunity and, if so, what would the next phase of relaxation of control measures look like were we to attain that threshold.</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the questions. The take-up rate is healthy across the vaccines that have been licensed and are being used in our various centres. But Sinovac has not been licensed yet. So, it is a bit premature to talk about that at this point in time.&nbsp;</p><p>The target is for as many of our eligible residents as possible to be vaccinated. Herd immunity, indeed, is useful. But you can also imagine that we would perhaps want to make sure that individuals who want to travel overseas would also continue to be protected and that requires them to be vaccinated because, once they are overseas, they will not benefit from herd immunity here in Singapore. So, let us get that number as high as possible and we hope to be able to offer the vaccinations to all eligible Singaporeans along with residents by the end of 2021.</p><p>It is a little bit premature to be then talking about the relaxation measures for the next phase when we have not reached it.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Abdul Samad.</p><p><strong>\tMr Abdul Samad (Nominated Member)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Senior Minister of State for the earlier explanation. I just want to check for the essential services workers. It was after I had submitted my Parliamentary Question that the announcement came for those who want to be vaccinated under a certain age group. But for workers in the essential services group, how do we then ensure that they are all vaccinated for the second dose in the appropriate time? The risk is because we tend to mix with migrant workers a lot and we also do a lot of engagements.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier, as far as I am concerned, the first group of essential workers are those who were working during the circuit breaker period. After that, all are not being given priority to go for their vaccination. Hopefully, MOH can review this.</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his concern. We are, indeed, tracking the completion of vaccinations among the essential workers closely and we do so through the employers as well as some of the regulatory bodies for the relevant domain. We could not wait to complete every single essential worker before we then started with the elderly, the vulnerable or other at-risk groups.</p><p>So, we have a parallel processing, if you like, that essential workers continue to be vaccinated although most of them have largely been done so, together with the roll-out to the elderly. And, just as now, not all the elderly are vaccinated, we have started with the next group and we will, in parallel, open up to more and more segments of our population as our vaccine supplies come in. But we will continue to pay close attention to make sure that those who are vulnerable or who are at high risk or who perform these essential functions will get priority.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Lim Biow Chuan.</p><p><strong>\tMr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten)</strong>: Sir, I have quite a large number of residents who wanted to travel for various reasons and who have made various appeals. Some of them may be for studies and some of them may be for other purposes, like looking after nephews, to attend weddings. For some reason, MOH has applied quite strict criteria to those who have made the appeals. I am asking MOH whether they will consider being more flexible about allowing people to get their vaccination earlier before they travel overseas, as contrasted to extending the vaccination programme to residents of a different age when they can be actually quite neutral about taking their vaccination earlier or later. So, we have one group who wants it earlier versus another group who are actually very neutral about whether they get their vaccination earlier. So, could MOH be a bit more flexible to allow those who want to get their vaccination earlier to get it earlier?</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the question. The issue is the limit of our vaccine supplies. Even though there may be some people who are a little bit agnostic about exactly when they get it and are willing to defer, the reality is that we are vaccinating people as quickly as possible, given the supplies that come in.</p><p>So, if we were to prioritise one group, it will be at the expense of another who currently wish to be vaccinated. The slots are booked and the capacity is being used up and the vaccines are being used up. So, we recognise that there are people who wish to be prioritised. We do have an appeals channel. We will try our best. There are criteria and it is very helpful that documentation is submitted to support those criteria and we will work our way through these appeals to try to help as many people to be vaccinated as soon as possible. But, ultimately, the limit is not our wish to force people who are perhaps a little bit hesitant at this point – we do encourage everybody to do it – the limit is actually the rate at which the supplies are coming in.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Ms Joan Pereira.</p><p><strong>\tMs Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>: Thank you, Speaker. I have a supplementary question. A few elderly residents told me they felt pain in their legs and their knees the day after vaccination. One even showed me a rash at the vaccination area. So, they worry and they wonder if it was caused by the vaccination or would it go away or they needed to seek treatment. So, I would like to propose if MOH would consider having a hotline manned by a multilingual team who can speak the mother tongue and dialects. It would be helpful to assure them.</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for her question. There are two points which are slightly separate. One is the importance of making sure that we make our materials, transactions and interactions available in multiple languages. Indeed, we will pay quite a lot of attention to this, especially on the ground at the service counters at the vaccination centres.</p><p>The separate issue is residents who then experienced symptoms after having had a vaccination. What the Member is describing is a situation where one has clinical symptoms a day after vaccination and was worried about whether these are problems where you need medical help. I would suggest that perhaps a MOH hotline manned by our non-clinical staff may not be the best first port of call for residents in such a situation. If they have clinical symptoms, if they have persistent pain, persistent fever, rash and, especially things like difficulty breathing, what they need is to seek clinical help and they should do so from the relevant hospital, polyclinic and clinical care providers that are close to them.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Ms Joan Pereira, next question.</p>",

The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which are currently the only COVID-19 vaccines allowed for use in Singapore, are widely recognised internationally.</p><p>MOH will be releasing further information on how individuals can show their valid vaccination status when ready. We will make it easy and convenient to prove one’s vaccination status, including for persons without smart phones. The measures required for the unvaccinated are generally based on public health considerations to prevent infection and, so, would not distinguish between those who choose not to be vaccinated and those who were not medically eligible. Other vaccines may be available in the future for those who are not currently medically eligible. We will continue to evaluate scientific data and review the eligibility criteria accordingly.</p><p>Data on the duration of the vaccine’s protection and its effectiveness in preventing transmission, has been encouraging thus far. More data is needed to assess if changes to border measures, such as testing and Stay-Home Notice (SHN) requirements, can be made for vaccinated individuals. More information is also needed to assess if such measures will be affected by the different types of vaccines. We are actively discussing with international counterparts on the possible mutual recognition of vaccination certificates. However, most countries have only just started vaccinations. Border measures will also take into account other factors, such as the number of COVID-19 cases and the infection control measures implemented in the source countries. Hence, progress on cross-border recognition of vaccine certification may take some time. We will provide further updates when there is significant progress.</p><p>The COVID-19 vaccination programme remains voluntary. MOH encourages everyone who is medically eligible to get vaccinated.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Ms Foo Mee Har.</p><p><strong>\tMs Foo Mee Har (West Coast)</strong>: Thank you, Speaker. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State one supplementary question. The federal authorities in the US have updated travel guidelines for fully vaccinated people. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have declared that vaccinated travellers do not need a COVID-19 test unless required by the destination country and do not need to be quarantined upon returning to the US but should only be tested before boarding their return flight.</p><p>I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State if our Health Sciences Authority has reviewed the scientific basis for the US CDC's recommendations and whether Singapore may issue similar guidelines.</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the question. Indeed, it is so and that is why, in the previous announcements, there were accommodations made for individuals who have completed the full vaccination regimen, such as from 24 April 2021, if you have had more than two weeks after your second dose, one can gain entry into events that require pre-event testing without the need to undergo pre-event testing.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, the same set of information has allowed us to make changes to the rostered routine testing for some personnel. So, the short answer to the Member's question is yes.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><p><strong>\tAssoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang)</strong>: I thank the Senior Minister of State for his responses. I am just wondering, very quickly, does the vaccine passport recognition influence our decision to approve specific types of vaccines? So, the concern, of course, is that, if we are approving vaccines with much lower efficacy rates, that will affect the overall recognition of our vaccine passports when they are to be issued.</p><p>And related to that, would the acceleration of the vaccine passport recognition be possible for countries that are deploying comparable vaccines to us?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his question. The answer is no. The factors taken into account for approving the vaccine are the vaccine's quality, its safety and its efficacy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Ms Ng Ling Ling.</p><p><strong>\tMs Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>:&nbsp;I thank the Senior Minister of State for sharing about the progress and discussing the vaccine COVID-19 passports with various countries. While we need to wait for this to develop because the vaccination programmes are still happening in many countries, can I check how many countries are we actively in discussion with? Are they mostly unique system of bilateral recognition? And are we expecting a significant public budget to have to be invested, when countries open up more for such a recognition system to happen for air travel?</p><p><strong>\tDr Janil Puthucheary</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the questions. It would be premature to discuss the details of this at this point in time. As I have explained in my initial answer, the process is very early. Many countries have not really gotten significant proportion of their population vaccinated. And in truth, we are only getting going recently, and so, it is something that we will update as and when we have further information in the future.</p>",

            "content": "<p>14 <strong>Mr Ang Wei Neng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Transport whether he can provide more details on the digital vaccine passport system between Singapore and Australia and travel bubble arrangements with countries that have the COVID-19 pandemic under control.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung)</strong>: Mr Speaker, the question is also on vaccination passport, now posed to MOT. But let me reiterate some of the points that Senior Minister of State Janil has made.&nbsp;</p><p>We are exploring with several countries and regions, including Australia, on the mutual recognition of vaccination certificates. The certificates can be physical or digital, and we will need them to be secure, tamper-proof and verifiable.</p><p>&nbsp;However, vaccinations are only one aspect of pandemic control. Social distancing, contact tracing, quarantine and testing are also very important aspects which countries and regions have used to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus even as vaccines become available.</p><p>&nbsp;Singapore will continue – together with MOH, MOT and other agencies&nbsp;– to holistically evaluate the COVID-19 situation in various countries and regions, and explore the possibility of restoring air travel when it is safe to do so. And we have been proactively doing so, given the importance of our global connections.</p><p><strong>\tMr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast)</strong>: Speaker, I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. I have two supplementary questions. One, how would the recent announcement by the Hong Kong government to bar SIA from flying to Hong Kong for two weeks, affect the negotiation or the preparation of the travel bubble between Hong Kong and Singapore. And two, will the Minister reveal which are the countries we are negotiating with and preparing for travel bubble over the next few months?</p><p><strong>\tMr Ong Ye Kung</strong>: Mr Speaker, in short, the recent suspension of SQ flights to Hong Kong does not affect the talks to establish or restore the air traffic bubble that did not get to start. The reason is this. Hong Kong's civil aviation authorities set in place very transparent criteria for airlines. Once they breach the criteria, they get suspended for 14 days. So, they have suspended 23 times before this latest incident, involcing SIA. The suspension came about because of technical reasons. One of the criteria was breached, which is that SIA had a transit passenger, not from Singapore, tested negative at pre-departure, but tested positive at post-arrival. So, maybe an old case with intermittent shedding.</p><p>And at the same time, I believe there were a few passengers who tested negative but carrying certificates from labs that are not ISO-certified. The Hong Kong civil aviation authorities enforce the criteria very strictly. So, it triggered the suspension.&nbsp;</p><p>Any travel bubble will not carry transit passengers. The travel bubble operates on the basis that the flights travelling within the bubble carries only what we call OD – Origin Destination passengers. So, transit passengers are outside of the bubble. We continue to want to work with Hong Kong to restore this travel bubble.</p><p>As for how many countries we are speaking to, there are many. But let me explain. I actually do not quite like the term \"vaccination passports\". It gives you the impression like we carry a passport and we can go anywhere. It does not work like that. I think what happens is every healthcare authority, after vaccination, issues a vaccination certificate that has to be verifiable, tamper-proof. And then, we talk to other regions and authorities to mutually recognise our certificates.</p><p>That is the part where we are talking to many partners because it is good to mutually recognise our certificates. In Singapore, we have a very strong certification system run by MOH&nbsp;– verifiable, notarised.</p><p>And after you mutually recognise the certificates, then you ask yourself, \"So what?\" Are you therefore&nbsp;– which is a question that Ms Foo Mee Har asked&nbsp;– subject to shorter quarantine, fewer tests? These are things that we have to discuss. I think the first criterion in such discussions would be, how safe is this region? If a place is safe, such as Brunei, New Zealand, Australia, even before there were vaccines, we already opened our borders to them. So, that is the first and foremost criterion.&nbsp;Is the place safe?&nbsp;And if it is moderately safe, then we can consider relaxing restrictions for vaccinated travellers.&nbsp;</p><p>From time to time, you will see public statements being made, but actually behind the scenes, a lot of work is going on. When there are significant progress and significant things to announce, we will do so and inform the public.</p>",

            "content": "<p>15 <strong>Mr Leong Mun Wai</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) with regard to the case of an Indian composer plagiarising the song titled \"Count on Me Singapore\", what actions has the Ministry taken to protect Singapore's copyright; and (b) what is the policy stance of the Government towards individuals who infringe on Singapore's national symbols and songs, whether for commercial gain or otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>16 <strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (a) whether the Ministry regularly checks the media and the Internet for possible infringements of our national symbols; (b) how many cases of copyright infringement have been uncovered to date and how were they dealt with; and (c) whether there are any plans to enhance the protection of intellectual property rights for our national symbols.</p><p><strong>\tThe Minister for Culture, Community and Youth (Mr Edwin Tong Chun Fai)</strong>: Mr Speaker, with your permission, can I take Question Nos 15 and 16 together?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Yes, please.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Edwin Tong Chun Fai</strong>: Sir, our principal consideration, when addressing questions as to the use of copyright in our national songs and symbols, is to ensure that we protect our ownership and interest in our national songs and symbols, as well as to promote the dignified use and respectful use of them.</p><p>&nbsp;To address Mr Leong Mun Wai's question about the actions the Ministry has taken to protect Singapore's copyright in the case of a composer plagiarising the song \"Count on Me Singapore\", let me set out the details of this incident.</p><p>&nbsp;We first received feedback that the song, \"We Can Achieve\", was featured in several videos, some of which were of school children, apparently from India, singing the song. This song was almost identical to \"Count on Me, Singapore\", save for minor differences, such as replacing the word \"Singapore\" with \"India\", and a line in the song which goes, \"we are told no dreams to hold that we can strive for\".</p><p>In the videos, the students appeared to be expressing their love for their country and the song was not disrespectfully treated. The publisher of the song \"We Can Achieve\" subsequently came forward to acknowledge that the song seemed to be substantially copied from \"Count on Me, Singapore\" and apologised for it, as well as removed it from their platforms.</p><p>We did not believe that there was any ill will or malice intended and hence accepted this apology.</p><p>&nbsp;Shortly after, one Mr Joey Mendoza, then alleged that he, in fact, was the one who wrote the song, \"We Can Achieve\" in 1983. This was an untenable assertion, given that this song, as I mentioned earlier, was practically identical to \"Count on Me, Singapore\". If his claim was right, it would be a direct affront to our own ownership and interest in the national song \"Count on Me, Singapore\".</p><p>&nbsp;We thus pressed Mr Mendoza to substantiate his claims. If he could not, then he should withdraw them. We were prepared to initiate legal proceedings, if necessary, to protect our position.</p><p>At the same time, we also undertook extensive fact-checking in Singapore and in India, to refute Mr Mendoza's claims. We obtained confirmation of contemporaneous and documentary evidence of the writing of the song, \"Count on Me, Singapore\". Mr Jeremy Monteiro, a respected musician and Cultural Medallion recipient, was witness to the events at the material time, contemporaneously. Members might have read his account in the news of how he worked alongside Mr Hugh Harrison when Mr Harrison composed the song in 1986.</p><p>In response to our requests for proof of his claims and to substantiate his position, Mr Mendoza then changed his position. He subsequently withdrew his claims. He admitted that he had no evidence to support his claims and confirmed the following in writing:</p><p>&nbsp;(a) that he unconditionally and irrevocably withdraws all claims to the lyrics and music of the song, \"We Can Achieve\" which he recognises is similar to \"Count on Me, Singapore\";</p><p>&nbsp;(b) that he had informed all his associates and networks of the above and also instructed all social media platforms to pull down the song \"We can Achieve\" with immediate effect; and</p><p>&nbsp;(c) that he had no intention of attacking the integrity or professionalism of Mr Harrison, the original composer of \"Count on Me, Singapore\".</p><p>&nbsp;Mr Mendoza's admission leaves no doubt that \"Count on Me, Singapore\" was written by Mr Harrison and that the rights and ownership in the national song remain with us. Mr Mendoza also wrote to us to confirm that the song \"We Can Achieve\" has been taken down from known networks and platforms. We have thus let the matter rest on this basis.</p><p>&nbsp;Sir, our national songs hold a special place in the hearts of Singaporeans. MCCY takes any challenge to our proprietary rights and interests in our national songs and symbols very seriously, and we will take the necessary steps to protect them. The current legal position for our national songs and symbols includes the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem legislation, SAFNA, as we call it in short, as well as the Copyright Act. The legislation around the use of the national symbols and the Government's stance on copyright of the national songs are intended to prevent misuse that might diminish or denigrate the standing of such symbols and songs.</p><p>&nbsp;At the same time, we should not take umbrage at every such use, and resort to legal remedies each time. A careful judgement is made in each case, as to whether and if so what, action is to be taken, along the considerations which I have outlined above.</p><p>To Mr Gerald Giam's question on whether the Government regularly checks for possible infringements of our symbols, the Ministry monitors reports on the use of the national songs and symbols by the media, does online sensing and also takes public feedback. Our symbols have generally been treated with respect and dignity. There have been rare cases of flag-burning, which usually involved other forms of misconduct, and were dealt with swiftly under the appropriate regulations in the Penal Code.</p><p>&nbsp;Mr Giam may be aware that MCCY first announced in September 2020 that it had initiated a review of the rules governing the national symbols. We are also looking into whether there is a need to enhance IP protection for our symbols. Honouring and respecting our symbols, however, is not something that is achieved only by legal regimes or protecting copyright. We must also cultivate and sustain a strong connection and respect that Singaporeans feel for symbols and songs. All of us have a part to play in upholding our symbols and passing them down to future generations. And to that end, MCCY has convened a citizens' workgroup on our national symbols to seek the public's feedback and views on this review, because these symbols indeed, belong to all of us.</p><p>I would like to take the opportunity to thank Singaporeans who have invested their time and energy to participate in the workgroup as well as those who have responded to our survey on our national symbols.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Gerald Giam.</p><p><strong>\tMr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for the reply. Our national songs were written by various composers, both local and foreign, some of whom were working for advertising agencies contracted by the Government.&nbsp;Can I confirm that the Government holds the exclusive copyright to the music and lyrics for all our national songs, such that none of these composers or advertising agencies can claim ownership whether now or in the future?</p><p>Secondly, if the Government holds this exclusive copyright, do groups and individuals need to seek permission from the Government to perform the copyrighted work publicly, whether in Singapore or overseas?</p><p><strong>\tMr Edwin Tong Chun Fai</strong>:&nbsp;The answer to Mr Giam's second question is yes, permission needs to be sought and the legal ambit and regulations that govern this will be set out in the Copyright Act, as with any other ownership of copyright.</p><p>As for Mr Giam's first question, most of the songs which were written by third parties, the copyright is with the Government. There are some other arrangements where the copyright in the composer and lyricist might be different. But in all situations, where it is either owned by the Government or managed by the Government, to that extent, permission would be sought before any third party uses or performs these songs on any other platform.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Leong Mun Wai.</p><p><strong>\tMr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>: Thank you, Speaker. I thank the Minister for the clarification. I have two questions.&nbsp;One is when MCCY put up the first statement on \"Imitation is the best form of flattery\", was it before Mr Mendoza came out to claim his rights?</p><p>Second question is, since Mr Mendoza had come up originally to claim his rights, after we had done our check on our rights, why did we not actually press the issue further and asked him to admit plagiarism, rather than just letting him go like that? Because in Singapore, we are aspiring to be the global original arbitration centre. Dealing with such infringement of IP rights lightly, will affect our aspirations to be that. Can the Minister clarify, please?</p><p><strong>\tMr Edwin Tong Chun Fai</strong>: On Mr Leong's first question, the original post by MCCY was before Mr Mendoza surfaced his claims. As I explained earlier, the first video or the first series of videos were of school children in a respectful setting, using the song albeit without permission. And it was in that context that the first message that Mr Leong refers to was put up.</p><p>Subsequently, when Mr Mendoza asserted his claim, as I explained in my answer earlier, Mr Mendoza's assertion was a direct challenge to our own ownership and proprietary interest in the song, then things took a different turn and we pressed Mr Mendoza to withdraw his claims, which brings me to my second point.</p><p>As I explained earlier, Mr Mendoza did in fact admit that he has no ownership interest; he has got no evidence to substantiate his position that he lays any claim to the song. He withdraws his position he previously took on \"We Can Achieve\".</p><p>So, to Mr Leong's point about assertion of interest in our copyright, assertion of our position and our ownership of such copyright, that was what we did precisely with Mr Mendoza.</p><p>Mr Leong should not also confuse asserting our rights with necessarily taking legal action, legal proceedings. They are not necessarily the same thing. And in this case, it was far more efficient, quicker and a lot more effective for Mr Mendoza to be persuaded that his own position was untenable, for his claims to be withdrawn by himself and not in any way removing the Singapore Government's claim and, in fact, for all Singaporeans' interest in the songs to be preserved.</p><p>That, I believe in this context, was a far more efficient outcome that was achieved in a matter of several days, as opposed to being caught up in protracted legal action, which could potentially take a fairly long period of time.</p>",

            "subTitle": null,
            "sectionType": "OA",
            "content": "<p>17 <strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa</strong> asked&nbsp;the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government’s published cash surpluses indicate that the Government has more fiscal space than it states in its Budget Statements; and (b) whether this reduces the need for the planned increase in GST rate.</p><p><strong>\tThe Second Minister for Finance (Ms Indranee Rajah) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his question as it highlights an area which some have misunderstood, leading to incorrect conclusions about our fiscal position and the need to raise GST. Let me explain why.</p><p>&nbsp;There is a distinction between (a) cash receipts and (b) revenue that is available for spending.</p><p>Cash receipts reflect all the cash that comes in. Every year, the Department of Statistics or DOS reports our cash receipts and indicates whether we have a cash surplus or cash deficit.&nbsp;But not all our cash receipts constitute revenue available for spending.&nbsp;</p><p>The largest difference between our cash receipts and revenue comes from the sale of state land. Such proceeds from land sales do not generate fresh revenue.&nbsp;They are simply a transformation of one asset to another – when land is sold, the asset is converted to cash.&nbsp;State land that are not due for immediate development are typically leased out for interim use. This yields revenue for the Government too, in the form of rental income.</p><p>So, selling land does not increase the Government’s revenue, and if we were to spend all the proceeds from land, it would deplete our store of wealth.</p><p>&nbsp;Think of a family that has a house. So long as the family owns the house, it can rent out some of the empty rooms to generate income. But if the family sells the house and uses the proceeds for day-to-day expenditure, it will soon have nothing left. However, if it invests the proceeds of sale wisely, it will still have the original sale proceeds, plus a constant stream of income from those proceeds. This income can then be used partially for expenditure and partially re-invested to help sustain both present and future members of the family.</p><p>&nbsp;Likewise, for Government budgeting, land sales proceeds are not considered part of our revenue and cannot be directly used for expenditure. Instead, they are invested and part of the investment income is used to support the spending needs of Singaporeans via the Net Investment Returns Contribution or NIRC.</p><p>The NIRC is now the largest single source of Government revenue, supporting about one-fifth of our spending needs. This is only possible because of the prudent and disciplined approach we have taken to building and protecting both our land and financial reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;In a recent social media post, the Workers' Party claimed that there is no need to raise GST because of the cash surplus. As I have explained, this claim is inaccurate and misleading. The bulk of our cash surpluses arise from land sales proceeds. Such cash proceeds do not create additional revenues for the Government and are therefore not a valid reason for holding off the GST increase.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</p><p><strong>\tMr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang)</strong>: Sir, I thank the Minister for her clarifications. Just one further related question. Under the Constitution, the Government is required to balance the Budget over the term of government. And so, I wanted to ask the Minister whether this requirement, does it lead to the Government typically being more conservative in the Budget during the early parts of the term, and then, distribute and spend a bit more in the later part of the term? Do we have that phenomenon because of that Constitution requirements?</p><p>Secondly, what is the Government's policy or the policy approach or principles in the way we distribute our accumulated surplus, accumulated during the term of government?</p><p><strong>\tMs Indranee Rajah</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his supplementary question. The Government seeks to run a balanced Budget over the term of government by spending prudently within the limits of its annual revenues and any accumulated surpluses. The Government has generally adhered to this in line with the Constitutional requirement. In general, this means that we avoid running deficits early in the term of government. This is not only to avoid a draw on past reserves, which should be reserved for exceptional situations, it also helps the Government to preserve fiscal headroom to deal with unexpected spending needs during its term of government.</p><p>However, in the event of a major crisis, the Government is prepared to run a deficit and seek a draw on past reserves regardless of which part of the term it happens to be in. And that is exactly what we have done this year because we have been facing one of the biggest crises of all.&nbsp;This year, the first full financial year of this term of government, we sought and obtained the President's approval to draw up to $11 billion for the continued fight against COVID-19.</p><p>If and when we have unexpected surpluses, we have used them in three ways. First, we share some of the surpluses with Singaporeans. In FY 2018, we distributed up to $300 per Singaporean through the SG Bonus following an exceptional surplus in FY 2017 due to unexpected market movements that resulted in higher Statutory Board contributions from MAS.</p><p>Second, we save for anticipated future needs such as the Railway Infrastructure Fund and the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund.</p><p>Last, any unutilised fiscal space becomes part of past reserves, which is invested and supports future spending needs via the Net Investment Returns Contribution.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Chua.</p><p><strong>\tMr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Sengkang)</strong>: Mr Speaker, firstly, I would like to thank Member Mr Liang for raising this question that we discussed during the Budget and, of course, the Minister for the elaboration.</p><p>A number of clarifications from me. Firstly, in the Parliamentary Question, it was asked about the fiscal space, and I recall in 2018, when the idea of the GST hike was first raised, if you look at the IMF Article IV report that was published at that point in time, and \"looking at these taxes would reduce private income and consumption, especially of low-income households. A GST hike alone could lead to a lower path for GDP and private consumption, and limited external adjustment, relative to using more of the available fiscal space\".</p><p>And, I think, again in 2019, the IMF also said that, \"Singapore has tended to overperform with respect to its fiscal rule of a balanced Budget over the political cycle, contributing to a large build-up of net assets suggesting that Singapore has substantial fiscal space.\"</p><p>Mr Speaker, if we look at the situation in 2018 versus today, where we have COVID-19 in terms of what is impacting the cost of living, the question that I have is, is raising a regressive tax such as the GST really the best option for us in terms of raising revenues? Could there be other options that could be explored, for example, looking at the NIRC framework again?</p><p>And this also brings me to the second clarification, which I also raised during the debate earlier in February, in that if you look at our reserves&nbsp;position today, we are looking at having drawn down about 20 years' worth of surpluses –&nbsp;some Members have said that it is about 10 years. Where do our reserve stand today versus, say, last 10 years or five years? That would help us to adequately frame the context of this GST rise as well.</p><p><strong>\tMs Indranee Rajah</strong>: Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for his clarification. He opened by saying that we had discussed this topic during the Budget. Actually, we had not.</p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p><strong>\t</strong></p><p>During the Budget, the Workers' Party, touched peripherally on the Budget. I believe Mr Louis Chua mentioned land sales. But what the Workers' Party did not say during the Budget debate, was what they had said in their social media post.</p><p>In their social media post, what they had actually said was that: \"the Government says that the Government expects a deficit of $11 billion\" and they said the deficit should only be $3.5 billion. So, effectively, in their social media post, what they are really saying is that the Government is not setting out the correct fiscal position.</p><p>The Government has set out the correct fiscal position. We do expect in this year, a deficit of $11 billion and we have explained why. So, essentially, in the social media post, what the Workers' Party had done was to point just to cash surpluses. And as I explained earlier, you cannot look just at cash surpluses to understand the fiscal position. You also need to look whether or not all of that constitutes revenue under our budgeting rules. And as for the reasons that I explained earlier, it does not. So, that was the first point that I wanted to respond to the Member Mr Louis Chua.</p><p>Then, the second point that he raised I think – well, he went through quite a lot of things but I think that the question that he ultimately came back to was, is the raising of GST the best option? I think after going through what the IMF said and so on, that was the question, and is it time to look at the NIRC formula again?</p><p>This has been explained in some detail by the Deputy Prime Minister during the Budget. In fact, this question should have been brought up during the Budget because then it would have given the Government the opportunity to explain the position.</p><p>But in summary, we all know, we are so badly constrained, because of COVID-19, we already have to go into actual reserves, we have to dip into actual reserves. It is no longer just a question of taking from income on the reserves. We are squeezed on the corporate tax front. Because of the economic situation, you can have a scenario where even your personal income tax is going to be affected. So, GST is one of the options that we have, but because we know that GST does have an impact on the lower income and the vulnerable, we take steps to deal with that.</p><p>So, as the Deputy Prime Minister explained earlier, actually 60% of our GST revenue comes from tourists and from the higher income. But we do know that middle income and lower income are affected, which is why we set aside the $6 billion Assurance Package, which will effectively buffer the majority of Singaporeans for five years against the increase and the lower income for 10 years.</p><p>And with respect to the last question, I think, whether when we look at our reserve position&nbsp;– we have already explained all of that in the Budget statement and Round-up speeches; it is not necessary for me to go into that. But essentially, our formula for spending of the returns is a fair one – 50% of returns. It is no magic to this formula but it is a fair formula: 50% for today's generation and another 50% for tomorrow's generation.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Chua.</p><p><strong>\tMr Chua Kheng Wee Louis</strong>:&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Speaker and I thank the Minister for the elaboration. The first point is that, during my speech,&nbsp;I did set out, in terms of the revenues and expenditures as well as how I arrived at some of these numbers.</p><p>But I think the question is also about whether or not, looking at this NRIC framework, that is something that we can revisit again. I agree with Minister that, because of COVID-19, this has actually impacted a lot of Singaporeans, a lot of corporates. And all the more, I think a regressive tax such as GST, should be something that we should reconsider. Because while the Assurance Package could offset the impact of the increase of 2% for a number of years, I think this is going to stick with them basically for the rest of their lives.</p><p>And if you look at, I recall Minister Lawrence Wong mentioning in 2018 that, we should never say never. So, if you look at the past amendments to the Constitution that we have done: in 1991, this was when the reserve protection framework was introduced; in 2001, we had the Net Investment Income framework; in 2008, NIR framework; and in 2015, Temasek Holdings was included the NIR framework as well.&nbsp;</p><p>So, given the impact of COVID-19 and all on the livelihoods of Singaporeans, the man on the street, could we not look at the NIRC framework again, as perhaps another measure, given where our reserves have been.</p><p><strong>\tMs Indranee Rajah</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, again, I thank the Member for his supplementary question. In essence, what the Member is saying is this: he is saying that you have the NIRC framework, can we not re-look it? We all know that things are not set in stone always, but we also know that when it comes to a matter of public policy and when you have frameworks, especially frameworks for expenditure, you cannot just chop and change every other year.</p><p>So, it would make instructive reading for Members and anybody who is interested in this, to actually go back to the time when we did set up the framework. This was dealt with in the speech by the Prime Minister when we did the amendments and it is a very instructive speech. Let me just read some parts of it.</p><p>He said, \"Parliament is considering an important Constitutional amendment to our reserves framework. The immediate issue before us is just a formula change. How much income can the Government draw from the past reserves? We are changing the formula. The new formula will allow us to spend somewhat more. But the deeper significance of this amendment is to establish a more sustainable and equitable basis for spending out of the investment returns. Sustainable and equitable, so that we have resources which can benefit both the present generation and future generations.&nbsp;While we spend for our needs, we also put aside a solid buffer for contingencies, for the proverbial rainy day.&nbsp;That is the deeper meaning.&nbsp;But the most fundamental significance of this amendment is that it reaffirms the importance of protecting our reserves...\".</p><p>In that speech, the Prime Minister takes us through the history of how originally it was just protecting the principal amount; then after that, we had the NII framework and we spent a 100% of that. Then, we went to 50%. The last amendment really encapsulated the formula that we want to use, the principle, which is that, on the returns, we use 50% for now, 50% for later.</p><p>So, I cannot say whether 50 or 100 years from now, we change that. But we should not do is just every year or every two years, when something looks like the the scenario will need a bit more expenditure, we just change the framework so easily. The framework took a long time to come to and was very carefully considered and thought through, tried and tested, many steps. And once we have a framework in place, you should not easily change it. But, and this is the real point, which I have mentioned, we know that there is an impact on lower income and middle income, which is why we have taken the steps that I mentioned earlier.</p><p>The Member talks about how the buffer or the Assurance Package will last for five years and 10 years, but the impact will be longer than that. Do not forget we have also said that we will enhance the permanent GST Voucher Scheme when the GST rate is raised. This will provide a permanent cushion for lower and middle income households, even after the temporary support ends. And also, over five and 10 years, there is time for incomes to rise.</p><p>So, it has been thought through very carefully, understanding that there is an impact on middle income and lower income, but we have taken the steps to ameliorate that, to buffer that, to make sure that they are okay.</p><p>But this still brings me back to the point I started off with, which is that it is not correct to suggest that because, we have a certain amount of cash surpluses that we therefore, that our fiscal position is better than we have stated or that we do not need to raise GST.</p>",

Singapore's overall labour productivity, as measured by real value-added per actual hours worked, rose by 2.7% per annum from 2016 to 2019, up from 2.2% in the preceding three years. Real median income from work of full-time Singaporeans, including employer CPF contributions, rose by 3.7% per annum from 2016 to 2019, higher than the 3.2% per annum growth in the preceding three years.</p><p>Up to 2019, our ITMs have been progressing well, with most of them on track to meet their targets.</p><p>Unfortunately, COVID-19 disrupted this progress. Some of our ITM sectors, such as Air Transport, Hotels and Retail were badly hit, and will take time to recover.&nbsp;That is why as part of the series of Budget measures, we provided special support for the harder hit sectors, to help them stay resilient.</p><p>Beyond the immediate impact, COVID-19 has also accelerated long-term structural trends such as digital transformation, a review of globalisation and a focus on sustainability.</p><p>&nbsp;We must therefore build on the head-start and progress that we have made in the last five years, and refresh our ITMs to meet the accelerated changes brought about by COVID-19.</p><p>For each of the 23 ITM sectors, we will update our sectoral strategies to create and seize opportunities through digitalisation, innovation, internationalisation, upskilling of workers and job redesign, with the aim of lifting the productivity and wages of our workers, and creating good jobs for Singaporeans. We target to complete this by next year.</p><p>Our ITM refresh is complemented by the work of the Emerging Stronger Taskforce and the Singapore Together Alliances for Action, which have served as pathfinders to help us seize immediate opportunities, even amidst COVID-19.</p><p>&nbsp;Ultimately, we transform our economy for the benefit of our people. Our ITMs chart the path forward for each sector to be competitive, so that our people can access good jobs and opportunities which improve their lives. Jobs and Skills are therefore key pillars of each ITM, supported through initiatives such as the next bound of SkillsFuture. We pay specific attention to mid-career workers, to help them stay employable and access good jobs.</p><p>Our tripartite partners have also been working closely together to ensure that business transformation is tied to workplace and workforce transformation. For example, Workforce Singapore has worked with Government agencies and industry to develop Jobs Transformation Maps to provide detailed insights on the impact of technology and innovation on the industry and workforce. The Labour Movement has also been working with businesses to establish Company Training Committees, to help our workers upgrade while supporting their companies' transformation. More immediately, the Labour Movement's Job Security Council is working hard to match and place workers, minimise retrenchments and shorten unemployment periods for our workers. This way, we achieve inclusive growth which uplifts our workers.</p><p>&nbsp;The Government is acutely aware of the plight of vulnerable workers who have been hardest hit by the pandemic. We have, therefore, been providing additional support for these workers who require more time and effort to reskill, upskill and re-join the workforce. One example is the Jobs Growth Incentive, to which we have allocated another $5.2 billion during the recent Budget to extend the hiring window by seven months. A higher level of support is provided to employers who hire mature local workers, persons with disabilities and ex-offenders.</p><p><strong>\t</strong>To help our senior workers, the Senior Employment Credit provides wage offsets for businesses that employ Singaporean workers aged 55 and above. We have also introduced the Enabling Employment Credit, which provides employers with wage offsets for every Singaporean person with disabilities earning below $4,000 per month that they employ. We will continue to build on these schemes to ensure that no one is left behind as we work with our tripartite partners to emerge stronger from the pandemic.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Patrick Tay.</p><p><strong>\tMr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer)</strong>: I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for the update on the ITMs. I just have two supplementary questions.</p><p>Firstly, in particular, the ITMs, I think two key focuses are on jobs growth as well as strengthening the Singaporean Core. I hope, as MTI and the respective sectoral ITMs flesh out their updates and do their revisions, to share where the jobs growth opportunities are as we overcome and emerge stronger together post-COVID-19.</p><p>The second supplementary question I have is with respect to the ITMs. I think different ITMs have varying successes. I hope to see more best sharing of good practices and the successes and the key success factors as well. But I also want to urge MTI as we look at the 23 ITMs and as we prepare for the next bound, to continue the good work of the sectoral tripartite committees because I felt, being personally involved in some of them, they are very useful in overcoming the sectoral challenges. So, I urge that, as we prepare for the next bound, to continue the good work of these sectoral tripartite committees.</p><p><strong>\tMr Heng Swee Keat</strong>: I thank Mr Patrick Tay for his supplementary questions.&nbsp;</p><p>To his first question on looking for new growth opportunities, I fully agree with him. In fact, as I have mentioned in my reply earlier, a post-COVID-19 world will be a very different world. We are already seeing many of these changes. Changes have been accelerated and, in particular, technological trends have also been accelerated, especially digitalisation. As I have said in my Budget speeches before, COVID-19 has accelerated digitalisation in a way which very few CTOs have been able to do. There have been significant changes in the nature of work and even in the nature of the way businesses conduct themselves. And I must say that our agencies are already responding to that quite well.</p><p>If you take, for example, the whole digitalisation trend, we are not waiting for the update of these ITMs before we act. We have increased the number of digital leaders and performers, especially among SMEs, from 9% to 12% from 2019 to 2020, and the share of digital starters also fell from 68% to 62%. Some of our MNCs and large local enterprises are on par with our global peers in this digitalisation.</p><p>What this digitalisation trend means is that the nature of the job and the nature of skills will be very different, which is why it is critical that we develop those skills of our workers in this respect. To meet this job growth, the answer is not just in the Government deciding which are the sectors that will grow and which are the sectors that will not. </p><p>And the significance of the Jobs Growth Incentive is exactly that when companies decide that they are going to grow, we incentivise them to draw in more workers and that is what the whole SGUnited Jobs and Skills package is all about. There are another part which is about the Attachments programme so that workers can get attached to get a sense of the nature of the job and companies can have a chance to evaluate the workers. For workers in newer areas, they can also go for training. These are the different ways in which we are preparing our workers and to grow our Singaporean Core, to move Singaporeans into areas with growth opportunities.</p><p>On Mr Patrick Tay's second question about the varying success of the ITMs. In fact, whether you do ITM or you do not do ITM, the nature of economic growth cannot be predicted in advance. You cannot say that in five years, these sectors will grow; in five years, these sectors will shrink. There are sectors which will face more challenging conditions for which we are helping them to stay resilient. I mentioned that air transport and tourism are the most obvious areas from this COVID-19 crisis. But at the same time, even in normal times, you will find that some sectors will grow faster than others. Therefore, the way that we are helping our workers is to ensure that we provide as much training as possible – and that is where I want to commend our Labour Movement for the very good work that they are doing – both in starting the company training committee so that when companies are looking at how they will change and transform, at the same time, the union is working together with them to look at how the workers can be retrained for that. And this is not something to be taken for granted. I think this tripartism where our Labour Movement is not there to just oppose change but, in fact, to facilitate change so that, at the end of the day, whatever changes that are made can be sustainable in that you have the full support of our workers and our workers can have a better life. So, this is really the crux of this. And I want to thank Mr Patrick Tay and his team for their very hard work in the Labour Movement in doing this.</p><p>Mr Patrick Tay asked whether there would be sharing of good practices. Indeed, in fact, I have just made some changes in the way we organise our ITM work to link it to our work on R&amp;D so that as technology and innovation play a more critical role in our economic future,&nbsp;we can work on both simultaneously. How can we help companies to transform to be more technologically savvy? And, in turn, I mentioned about the jobs transformation programme. How do we design programmes to enable our workers to have better skills in order to access those better jobs so that not only do the companies have higher productivity but our workers can look forward to higher wages and better employment prospects?</p><p>On Mr Patrick Tay's point on the sectoral tripartite committee, I fully agree with him. These are important work in which we bring all our stakeholders together so that we put our efforts together to achieve a greater impact. So, I would like to thank Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Sharael Taha for their questions.</p><p><strong>\tMr Speaker</strong>: Mr Sharael Taha.</p><p><strong>\tMr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>:&nbsp;I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for sharing the progress made by the ITMs and the improvements we have in productivity and I look forward the ITM refresh.</p><p>I would like to pose two supplementary questions on ITMs. Given that the ITMs began a few years ago, much has changed since then and we have learnt a lot in the past one year from the pandemic and changing macroeconomic situation. Are we incorporating these lessons learnt and revising the ITMs to better prepare ourselves for the future? For example, in the manufacturing ITM, should we be incorporating capability for vaccination production or preparing for PPE production in preparation for the next pandemic? And for the healthcare ITM, should we explore the use of technology or develop more skills to build latent capacity in our healthcare system that can be called upon and scaled up quickly when the next pandemic arises?</p><p>For the second question, coincidentally, today marks the first day, after close to a year, where working from home is no longer the default work arrangement. In an earlier Straits Times poll, three in four respondents do not wish to return to the workplace full-time. Work from home or work from anywhere has brought about many benefits for both businesses and employees, including for the vulnerable workers and workers with mobility challenges. Not only does it allow jobs to be more accessible to all, it could also be a competitive advantage for companies in Singapore to vie for jobs outside of Singapore. This could be a game-changer for our professional services ITM. Can we lock in the gains of remote and flexi-work arrangements before we revert back to the pre-COVID norms? Can we relook at the opportunities to incorporate this into our ITM, moving forward?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>\tMr Heng Swee Keat</strong>: I thank Mr Sharael Taha for his questions. Indeed, not only can we work from home, we can work from anywhere and you get calls any time as well.</p><p>Mr Sharael Taha mentioned about whether we should take into account the lessons learnt from the pandemic as well as the lessons from these few years of implementation. Indeed, we should do that. And to the Member's specific question, for example, on manufacturing, what are the new opportunities for production of vaccines, for example, or even some way in which we can play a role in the vaccine, the economic agencies have been working very hard on this and I would leave the economic agencies to provide the announcement. All I can say is that I have provided sufficient budgetary support for us to secure some of these projects.</p><p>On the Member's question about the skills, for example, healthcare and for us to move towards digitalisation, indeed, that should be the way. And as I have said, digitalisation has been accelerated and we must take this opportunity to look at how we can not only digitalise as much of our companies' processes as possible but also help our workers to build the new skills to be able to access those opportunities. And, in fact, beyond that, I have seen in many of our community centres, for example, that many seniors are being taught how to use digital tools – and I just did one over the weekend&nbsp;– as well as the projects to help our hawkers go digital, help our stallholders go digital and these are achieving good progress. So, I will say, certainly, we must take into account the changes.</p><p>As to the Member's second question about work from home and work from anywhere and that this is a game-changer, I fully agree with him that this is a game-changer. But let me add that this is a game-changer that cuts both ways. If you can work from home, anybody in the world can also work from home. And I have seen, for example, videos of how workers in very, very depressed areas being able to access jobs in very advanced economies because all they needed was a knowledge of English, a knowledge of basic skills in doing what they were good at doing, a laptop and an Internet connection. And I have seen companies that have actually chopped up a very complex project into different bits and different parts for which they put it online for bidding and then you have workers all over the world bidding for those projects. And in one of the reports I saw, the worker was extremely happy because he had never earned that amount in his whole life. The company was extremely happy because the the cost to him was a fraction of what he had to pay in an advanced economy with very strong laws regarding employment and so on.</p><p>So, it is a major, major opportunity but also a major challenge. That is why in all of last year's Budgets and this year's Budget, we have placed a very, very strong emphasis on upgrading the skills of our workers and I look forward to our Labour Movement working closely together with us on the Company Training Committee and a Job Security Council so that we can help our workers access good jobs, better jobs and to be able to ride on this digitalisation trend. And I hope that the work that we are going to embark on in a refreshed way, linking our R&amp;D efforts with the economic sectors and pulling together these different strengths of efforts will enable us to make even better progress.</p><h6>3.00 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order.

(proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Tan Kiat How) (for the Minister for National Development)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for National Development, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a second time\".</p><p>Sir let me first sketch out the context of this Bill before outlining the key amendments.</p><p>The Built Environment sector, especially the construction industry has been severely impacted by COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>Almost all construction work stopped during the circuit breaker period last year. Many companies, particularly our SMEs were hard hit as no work meant there was no progress payment.</p><p>Even when works restarted, companies had to adapt to new requirements, such as ensuring our workers attend their rostered routine testing and adhering to safe management measures at the worksites.</p><p>In response, the Government has intervened very significantly to support the sector.</p><p>Amongst other measures, we introduced a $1.36 billion Construction Support Package, extended waivers and rebates of the Foreign Worker Levy, and provided wage subsidies under the Jobs Support Scheme.</p><p>The most recent measures announced last week include the waivers for foreign worker levies for construction Work Permit and S Pass holders during their SHN period of 14 to 21 days upon entry into Singapore, for the period between 1 January 2021 to 30 September 2021.</p><p>We have also put in place legislation through the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act to provide temporary relief to businesses and individuals who are unable to perform their contractual obligations due to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>This ensured that no one single part of the built environment value chain has to bear a disproportionate share of the burden brought about by the pandemic.</p><p>To recap, Part 2 of the Act provides temporary relief from stipulated types of legal actions and also provides firms with a defence against breach of contract and damages due to COVID-19.</p><p>Under Part 8, we provided a mechanism for firms to seek relief from additional rental costs that are incurred due to construction delays caused by COVID-19.</p><p>Under Part 8A, we legislated for a universal extension of time of four months, or 122 days, for construction contracts.&nbsp;</p><p>Under Part 8B, we required the players in the value chain, from builders to contractors to sub-contractors to co-share additional costs for delays also due to COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Under Part 8C, developers who face construction delay can seek relief on the date of delivery of possession. We also provided for the co-sharing between developers and purchasers of the out-of-pocket costs incurred by purchasers where developers are not able to deliver the units by the committed delivery date due to delays caused by COVID-19.</p><p>We are working closely with industry partners to get the sector to get back on its feet.</p><p>I am pleased to share that almost all our construction S Pass and work permit holders have returned to work, although the numbers have decreased by about 15% in January 2021 compared to the year before.</p><p>The last infection case for construction S Pass and work permit holders in our dormitories was more than 30 days ago.</p><p>Construction activities at the worksites have largely resumed, to approximately 85% of pre-COVID-19 levels.</p><p>Construction demand is expected to rebound to some extent in the next few years. The Building Control Authority (BCA) estimates that $23 billion to $28 billion worth of projects will be awarded this year.</p><p>However, despite this steady progress, firms in the built environment sector continue to face significant pressures in the near term.</p><p>Construction projects have to manage with lower productivity on site due to safe management measures, which are needed to keep our workers and the broader community safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Firms face shortages of manpower and labour cost increases as we need to continue to limit the inflow of migrant workers into Singapore for good public health reasons.</p><p>BCA and MOH are reviewing the safe management measures at worksites, taking into account the need to balance the risk of on-site transmission and other considerations including the vaccination of our migrant worker population.</p><p>We have commenced COVID-19 vaccination for migrant workers. To date, 97% of some 9,000 COVID-19-naïve workers from five largest dormitories have received their first dose of vaccine. A further 30,000 migrant workers across 30 dorms are scheduled to get their first dose in the coming weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The take-up of the vaccination has been encouraging and we aim to make significant progress by the end of the year, in lockstep with the nation’s vaccination programme.</p><p>Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, while the sector is slowly getting back on its feet, we are not out of the woods yet. It is in this context that I am introducing the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment No 2) Bill.</p><p>First, the proposed amendments to the Act will allow us to extend the existing reliefs for the sector provided under Part 2 of the Act. This will have the effect of extending the period for cost-sharing in construction contracts under Part 8B of the Act.</p><p>Second, the proposed amendments will also allow us to better administer Part 8C of the Act.</p><p>Let me step through these in turn.</p><p>First, for construction and supply contracts, we intend to extend the temporary relief measures for a period of six months, to 30 September 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>The construction industry has long and complex value chains, with multiple tiers of sub-contracting.&nbsp;Given the cascading chain nature of construction and supply contracts across the multiple tiers, an expiry of the relief could result in a wave of contractual disputes, especially during this time when the sector is still stabilising.&nbsp;</p><p>If firms embroiled in legal disputes are forced to wind up, this could lead to a domino effect where multiple firms along the value chain would wind up successively. This ripple effect could result in further construction delays or uncompleted projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, in consultation with industry partners, we believe that it is prudent to extend this cost-sharing relief under Part 8B for another six months.</p><p>Contractors who incur additional cost as a result of COVID-19 would also benefit from this extension.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the cost-sharing under Part 8B will still remain at 50% of the qualifying costs and will still be subject to a monthly cap of 0.2% of contract sum per month, and a total 1.8% of the contract sum.&nbsp;That is for construction and supply contracts.</p><p>For options to purchase and agreements for the sale and purchase of residential, commercial and industrial properties with developers, including those with HDB, we intend to extend the temporary relief measures under Part 2 for a further period of three months, to 30 June 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>This will provide more time for developers and purchasers who are unable to perform any of their contractual obligations to negotiate and reach a compromise.&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, in view of the impact of the COVID-19 situation on the economy, it will assist purchasers who require more time to sort out their finances and make their payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Clause 2 of the Bill will amend the sunset period under Part 2 of the Act, so that the reliefs under that part can subsist beyond the sunset date of 19 April 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, we propose to extend the sunset period for another year, until 19 April 2022.</p><p>This will allow for the extension of the relief periods for construction and supply contracts, options to purchase, and agreements for the sale and purchase of properties beyond the current sunset date of 19 April 2021.</p><p>Next, this Bill also introduces a number of amendments to Part 8C of the Act to facilitate the implementation and the delivery of the relief when it comes into operation in a few months.</p><p>We have been working very closely with the relevant agencies and industry stakeholders on the operational details.&nbsp;</p><p>We want to ensure that the process of tapping on the relief is efficient for both the purchasers and the developers, given that this will be in effect for a longer period as compared to the other reliefs under the Act.</p><p>Let me first briefly recap the Part 8C relief before dealing with the specific amendments.</p><p>Part 8C is intended to assist developers who are facing construction delay due to COVID-19 and are unable to meet the committed delivery date of possession to purchasers.&nbsp;</p><p>We have been encouraging developers who are unable to meet the date of delivery of possession to first discuss with their purchasers and come to a workable and mutually agreeable arrangement.</p><p>For developers who are unable to come to an arrangement and require help, Part 8C will then allow them to extend the date of delivery of possession up to the universal extension of time provided for construction projects which is four months, or 122 days. Should the developer need relief of more than 122 days, they can apply to an assessor for a determination of the length of construction delay that is caused by COVID-19.</p><p>And where the developer has extended the date of delivery of possession, purchasers may seek reimbursement from the developer for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred due to the delay in delivery of the unit, up to a specified cap. This allows for co-sharing of such costs between the developer and the purchaser and if there are any disputes, parties can apply to an assessor for a determination. The assessor will consider the facts of the matter and make a fair and just determination of the cost that the purchaser is entitled to claim from the developer.</p><p>Let me now just highlight the key amendments.&nbsp;</p><p>Clause 4 amends the Act to provide for the different manners in which the purchaser may claim and obtain reimbursement of qualifying costs. For example, after the amount has been determined, the developer can directly reimburse the purchaser, or the purchaser can offset the amount of reimbursement against any instalment or other payment payable by the purchaser to the developer under the affected agreement. This will provide more options for purchasers and developers to settle between themselves the reimbursement that is due based on what works best for them.&nbsp;</p><p>Clause 5 introduces a new provision to empower the Registrar of assessors to, on such terms as a Registrar of assessor thinks just, extend the period within which a person is required under Part 8C to do anything. There may be instances where parties have genuine exceptional circumstances for requiring more time to carry out an action in relation to the relief. And this provision gives the Registrar the flexibility to extend the time for these parties, if the extension is justified.&nbsp;</p><p>Clause 6 amends the Act to provide that the Minister is to appoint one or more authorised nominating bodies for the purpose of providing assessors to hear and determine applications. As Part 8C will be operational for a few years until the projects of all qualifying current contracts are completed, we can expect personnel changes amongst the assessors. Allowing the authorised nominating bodies the point assessors who satisfy the requirements prescribed will facilitate a more efficient management of personnel turnover.</p><p>Clauses 8 and 9<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"> deal with miscellaneous matters relating to proceedings before an assessor, including subsequent determinations and the confidentiality of information and documents, and the making of regulations under this part.</span></p><p>Sir, let me conclude.&nbsp;The Built Environment sector builds our homes and workplaces, lays our essential infrastructure, like roads and utilities and develops our recreational and green spaces like malls and parks. An impact to the Built Environment sector goes beyond the stakeholders in the value chain and will affect other industries and Singaporeans in one way or another.</p><p>While the sector has been severely impacted with the onset of COVID-19, it has shown great resilience to get back on its feet. The Government is committed to partner the industry to ensure that the ecosystem continues to function, construction work continues to progress smoothly and we do not lose important industrial capabilities, even as we transform the sector. This Bill is an important part of this effort to ensure the sector stays on its feet and emerge stronger. With that, Mr Speaker Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><h6>3.20 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry (Kebun Baru)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I fully support this Bill as it will go far to help our Built Environment sector, in its moment of greatest need. I spoke to a number of players in the industry and they voice appreciation for the Government's COVID-19 related support. These include controlling the pandemic despite all odds, reducing foreign workers levy during the height of COVID-19, pushing forward additional Government support projects, getting banks to provide much-needed support, proceeding to pay for some Government projects, even as constructions were delayed, and to this Bill today pushing for moratorium in legal actions arising from the delay.</p><p>The recent announcement to remove foreign workers levy during quarantine is also very welcomed.</p><p>Nevertheless, COVID-19 represents a big and complex crises for the industry. Beyond this Bill, it is necessary to arrest the manpower cost surge which has led to a dramatic increase in construction costs. This can be seen in the escalating costs of successful BTO construction tender bids from pre-COVID-19 days to today. The surging of manpower cost is, in turn, largely due to three factors: the cost of Safe Management Measures (SMMs), high attrition of assisting migrant workers and difficulty to safely bring in adequate replacement of migrant workers.</p><p>Let me go into the details. First, the cost of SMMs is unavoidable because it is the price of keeping COVID-19 under control.</p><p>Second, we are seeing higher worker attrition because many workers want to return home to be there for the family during COVID-19, while&nbsp;some workers went back, but could not return.</p><p>And some industry players also worried that after vaccination, some of our workers may leave Singapore and seek what they believe is greener pastures, given the widespread migrant worker shortage in other advanced economies.</p><p>Due to this higher natural attrition, a number of migrant workers, especially those in smaller firms, have asked for hefty pay increases in return for staying on. MOM has recently limited the number of workers that companies can poach from one another and this has reduced the pressure. But the real solution is to ensure the safe replacement of sufficient number of migrant workers.</p><p>And so that brings me to my third point, the challenge of bringing in replacement workers. The industry faces high quarantine cost of $2,400 per migrant worker, which has not decreased even as we move quarantine from hotels to dedicated non-hotel facilities. Despite the COVID-19 insurance, many firms fear the potential extra medical costs in a range of tens of thousands of dollars should any of the incoming workers suffer from severe COVID-19 symptoms. As such, while large companies working on projects of healthy margins and has the financial muscle and the cash flow to absorb this cost in the short run, we need to urgently resolve the safe replacement to help the rest of the industry along.</p><p>After discussing with some industry players, I would like to propose this. Given that a large number of general construction migrant workers come from countries such as India and Bangladesh, is it possible for the Government to work with the Built Environment sector to forward deploy resources in key cities in these countries, given that COVID-19 vaccination is proceeding very slowly in Asia. For example, can we run commercial processing centres in those cities that will give us full operational control to ensure that testing is done by vetted vendors? The workers who have passed the test or who have already acquired immunity can be immediately transported to Singapore safely. And once they arrive in Singapore, they can be immediately get tested and vaccinated during quarantine.</p><p>Mr Speaker, Sir, let me conclude. COVID-19 has brought upon an existentialist threat to the Built Environment sector. Decisive and effective Government action has put off the worst outcome for the industry. An extension of the temporary measures today is very much needed to give the Built Environment sector more time to achieve a soft landing.</p><p>Moving forward, the Built Environment sector is grappling with surging costs, which means higher construction costs for Singapore, diminishing margins for most part of the industry and increased risk of project delays and chain bankruptcy.</p><p>Even as we push for the Built Environment sector to achieve higher manpower productivity in the long run, it is necessary for us to do more to bring an adequate replacement migrant workers in the immediate future. And this will ensure that as much of the recent construction cost surge is transient rather than permanent. With that, I stand in support of the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Sylvia Lim.</p><h6>3.25 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sylvia Lim (Aljunied)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to seek some clarifications on this urgent Bill, particularly on Clause 2 and to the amendments to Part 8C of the Act.&nbsp;</p><p>First on Clause 2. Clause 2 extends the validity of Parts 1 and 2 of the Act for another year to 19 April next year. These parts were enacted to enable parties to apply for temporary relief from fulfilling contractual obligations affected by the pandemic. The proposed extension is a recognition of the ground reality that there are still many businesses and individuals which continue to suffer adverse impacts from COVID-19.</p><p>I note that the Government has decided, however, not to extend Part 3, which provides for temporary relief for financially distressed individuals and entities. To recap, Part 3 had among other things, raised the threshold for individual bankruptcy and corporate winding up from a debt of $15,000, to $60,000 and $100,000 respectively. It had also increased the time period to pay from three weeks from demand to six months. This Bill confirms that the provisions of Part 3 will end on 19 April this year as scheduled. Yet today, we still see individuals and businesses who are drastically affected by the COVID-19 restrictions from earning income to pay their bills. These include our residents who used to run excursion and catering businesses, who have so far been unable to pivot to other business models.&nbsp;</p><p>As we inch towards economic recovery, COVID-19 support programmes are being scaled down or stopped. However, economic recovery has been uneven across sectors. On this note, it will be most useful for the Government to explain why it decided that there was no need to extend Part 3 of the Act to give individuals and businesses continued breathing space from insolvency proceedings.</p><p>Next, I move to the amendments to Part 8C of the Act. Part 8C deals with the extension of the delivery date of property under sale and purchase agreements. The rationale for Part 8C remains sound. It enables developers, HDB and JTC to have more time to complete construction projects delayed by the pandemic. It also enables purchasers of units to claim additional costs incurred by the delays such as the cost of alternative accommodation.</p><p>Part 8C was enacted into law by Parliament in November last year under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment No 3) Bill. From what I understand, Part C has not come into operation yet and I believe earlier the Minister of State did say it would be operational in a few months' time. I wonder why this is so since the amendments in November last year were brought to the House on a Certificate of Urgency. In comparison, the amendments relating to TraceTogether were brought to Parliament only in February this year and are already in force.</p><p>In addition, could the Minister explain why the amendments to Part 8C are being made even before the provisions become operational? I recall that at the November sitting, the Minister had assured Members that those provisions were drafted after wide consultations with the industry and were supported by the industry associations.</p><p>Next, I wish to make two observations about clause 8 of the Bill. I particularly welcome the new Section 39 OA, which provides for subsequent determination by an assessor based on new information. This is an important avenue to correct any injustice caused by an original determination, which was later proved to be unwise. Clause 8 also introduces a new section 39 OB which provides that parties coming for an assessment cannot be represented an advocate and solicitor unless special permission is given. Such a \"no-lawyers-allowed\" clause is not novel and is present in other legislation that aimed to provide low cost and less formal dispute resolution mechanisms. Despite the good intention behind this no-lawyers-allowed rule, I wish to point out that experience has shown that this can inadvertently lead to unfairness.</p><p>Residents who have gone through such hearings have highlighted to me that parties who are corporations have the advantage of sending their legally trained employees to represent the corporate entity, thus somewhat circumventing the no-lawyers-allowed rule. This has happened in the Employment Claims Tribunal and before the Financial Industry Dispute Resolution Centre or FIDReC.&nbsp;Corporate employers and financial institutions send their in-house counsel, who are not considered advocates and solicitors, while the employee or bank customer has to appear in his own capacity. This imbalance of knowledge and power has the potential to lead to an unjust outcome.</p><p>For this Bill, it is foreseeable that developers, HDB and JTC will send legally trained employees to present their cases in front of assessors, while the purchaser has to prepare his own case.&nbsp;I would like to ask if the assessors are alive to this risk of unfairness and how to address it.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Louis Ng.</p><h6>3.30 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, our construction sector has been suffering for the past year. Labour supply has been constrained, and cashflow has been tight. Some construction firms have already gone under, and the struggle is real for those still clinging on.</p><p>This Bill helps them. Those who have to pay will have more time to pay. Those who need to deliver will have more time to deliver. I thank MND for looking out for both sides.</p><p>Sir, I have two points of clarification for this Bill.</p><p>My first point is about what factors that went into deciding on this extension. Can Minister clarify what factors were considered before granting the initial four-month extension in November and now this six-month extension?&nbsp;</p><p>The construction sector does indeed need help. But a strong economic recovery must also be built on the rock-solid foundation of contractual obligations.&nbsp;One year after the start of the pandemic, we are granting a second extension of contract deadlines that is even longer than the first extension.</p><p>While I support these amendments, can I ask if MND has also studied the impacts to the companies the construction firms has been granted relief from? Are these companies also clinging on and will they go under due to these reliefs granted to the construction firms?</p><p>We have said that during this relief period, parties are encouraged to negotiate and resolve their difference in an amicable and mutually beneficial manner. Can I ask Minister what percentage of parties were able to resolve their difference in an amicable and mutually beneficial manner?&nbsp;</p><p>Further, I hope that MND can help shed light on a few questions.</p><p>First, can MND share what factors it considered in determining this particular course of action?&nbsp;Second, can MND share whether it will consider future extensions of the same nature and, if so, what factors it will consider before making such decisions?&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I think no one in this House disagrees that we want to help our businesses survive. But we should also be concerned about the unintended side-effects of our decisions.</p><p>Singapore has always had a reputation as a business-friendly country. With this Bill, we might risk that reputation by again intervening with how contracts play out. It remains unclear whether there will be a third, a fourth and then, a fifth extension.&nbsp;I hope the Government will articulate a long-term plan for our construction sector that clarifies these doubts.</p><p>That brings me to my next point. My second point is about how MND and the rest of Government&nbsp;can help the construction sector bounce back on its feet.</p><p>This crisis is an opportunity for our construction firms to become more nimble. More than ever, they need to embrace automation, upskilling and other productivity-related initiatives.&nbsp;But such processes take time to implement. In the short run, our construction industry needs workers to fulfill the projects it has already committed to based on pre-pandemic labour conditions.</p><p>Therefore, I hope that MND works with other Government Ministries to create a temporary scheme, where employers can more easily rehire Work Permit and S Pass workers who have been repatriated to their countries in the past year.</p><p>MND has taken some steps in this direction by allowing workers that have previously obtained the necessary Skills Evaluation Certificate (Knowledge) test (SEC(K) test) qualifications in a particular trade to return and work in the same trade in Singapore, without retaking the test.</p><p>The unfortunate reality of COVID-19 is that many companies have shut down. During the painful months of circuit breaker and dorm lockdowns, many experienced workers did not manage to find new employers and were often repatriated rather than circulated back into our economy. These were workers with experience living and working here. They know the expectations, they know the environment. It is more efficient to rehire them than to roll the dice with new workers. But there is no easy way for companies to find and hire these workers.</p><p>MND and other Ministries should work together to reduce the obstacles to rehiring such workers.</p><p>We can also provide more help for companies to hire workers who want to remain in Singapore but whose company has decided to terminate their contracts and send them back to their home country.&nbsp;A temporary scheme to reconnect employers with such workers will be much appreciated by workers and employers, and it will help our economy.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, notwithstanding my clarifications, I stand in support of this Bill.</p><h6>3.35 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I declare my interest as I have many corporate clients in the construction industry. In Mandarin, please.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20210405/vernacular-Don Wee COVID 5April2021-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>COVID-19 has dealt a severe blow to our construction industry. Most construction projects have been delayed. In addition to developers and their employees, related suppliers, contractors and the blue-collar construction workers, even building owners, buyers, sellers and tenants have been affected. Many Singaporeans who anticipated their new HDB flats have had to delay moving into their new homes. The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill seeks to provide viable and reasonable solutions for all affected stakeholders.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister, if HDB is the developer and a flat applicant is not able to move into his new home because his flat’s construction has been delayed beyond the legal completion date and he needs to rent a place elsewhere or pay the buyer of his old residence damages as he continues to stay there, is HDB liable for these extra rental and compensation costs?</p><p>Clause 3 of the Bill provides that the developer may only further extend the delivery date after the developer has already extended the original delivery date by a total of 122 days. I would like to ask how did MND derive 122 days? This 122-day duration is longer than the three months' circuit breaker period.</p><p>As for the assessors appointed by the Government, would the Ministry provide details about them, such as their backgrounds and professional credentials and how does the Ministry determine that they are independent?</p><p>Most main contractors will issue a bankers' guarantee to the developer in order to perform contractual obligations. Since the developers are allowed under the law to delay the projects, these developers should not file claims and lawsuits against sub-contractors downstream. Doing so will only heap additional burdens upon troubled SMEs. Can MND work with relevant commerce chambers and associations, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to inform the industry and banks here?</p><p>One way to prevent similar delays from happening in the future is to reduce reliance on foreign labour and supplies coming from overseas by improving productivity and upscaling domestic manufacturing capabilities to produce more Precast Concrete Building Components. I believe the Government is already working on these changes.</p><p>To prepare myself for the debate on this Bill, I had a chat with a successful \"TowKay\" (business owner), to understand more about the construction industry. I jokingly asked Mr Lee, \"You are already so wealthy, despite the on-going challenges. Why are you still going after every tender and cent?\" His reply was, \"I have many mouths to feed.\"</p><p>Indeed, like our Government, many local construction owners have a strong sense of responsibility to take care of their employees, many of whom are sole breadwinners. According to the Labour Market Report, as of December 2020, there were about 116,300 Singaporeans and 288,700 foreigners working in the construction industry. I believe the Government will work with the industry and address the concerns so that our country’s infrastructure development will not be compromised. Notwithstanding my queries above, I support this Bill.</p><h6>3.39 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I declare my interest as a lawyer who advises on construction law and has clients in the construction sector.</p><p>I generally support this Bill.&nbsp;This Bill extends many of the interim relief measures that were provided to the construction sector to deal with COVID-19 for a further six months.&nbsp;</p><p>The construction sector has been hard hit.&nbsp;The freezing of borders and shutdowns in various countries have meant delays in supplies arriving from overseas.&nbsp;Locally, manpower constraints have been acute as it has been difficult to get workers from abroad, while workers located in Singapore have been prevented from working or delayed from working both by the general lockdown and safety measures as well as dormitory specific constraints.&nbsp;Labour costs have also risen as employers compete with each other for the limited available manpower.</p><p>Against hits backdrop, the Government’s interventions have provided an important lifeline for those in the construction sector.&nbsp;Extensions of time have been given for performance of obligations, which is vital because liquidated damages may kick in otherwise.&nbsp;The rights to call performance bonds have been limited, and effectively, the legislation has prevented parties from penalising counterparties who cannot perform because of COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Generally, I think this is a well thought through Bill that tries to carefully share the burden of the losses arising from COVID-19.&nbsp;Absent legislation, I think it is likely to fall on the smaller players down the value chain.&nbsp;</p><p>I do have a few clarifications to ask the Minister of State.</p><p>One group that will suffer from delays in construction is the ultimate purchaser.&nbsp;To cushion the blow for these purchasers, there are provisions here permitting them to make claims against the developers for a portion of any additional rental expenses they may incur as a result of having to find alternative accommodation during the period of delay.&nbsp;Is the Minister of State able to share any data on how many purchasers have used this provision and what is the overall financial impact of these payments on developers would be?</p><p>Second, the aim of the legislation is to share the costs and losses across the value chain.&nbsp;I am interested to know how effectively this is being done in practice?</p><p>Third, while extensions of time are being given for project completion, payment is the lifeline of the construction sector and work is still expected to continue during this period.&nbsp;Is the Government aware of companies in hardship because they are expected to continue to work but are unable to receive payments in the meantime as a result of this legislation? This will typically apply to the main contractors and others who may be sandwiched. So, what will happen is the subcontractors who are below them, may be able to get extensions of time from delivering against their obligations; which means that the work the contractor higher up has to do to receive his payment, will not be complete. But this contractor higher up the value chain may have to pay other&nbsp;sub-contractors who had done their work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am just curious whether any larger contractors or contractors at the middle of the value chain have been facing hardship and may face further hardship as a result of this.</p><p>My suggestion to deal with this would be for developers and main contractors in turn to take a more reasonable approach in making payments to contractors lower down the value chain for partial completion of work, even if this means entire milestones may not have been completed as required under the contract. If this is not done voluntarily, then, further legislative intervention may be necessary to address this issue – otherwise, it is the parties in the middle of the value chain that may crack under pressure. Notwithstanding the points above, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Minister of State Tan Kiat How.</p><h6>3.43 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Tan Kiat How</strong>: Mr Speaker,&nbsp;Sir, I thank the Members for their comments and support of the Bill. They have raised a number of issues and let me address them.</p><p>Mr Louis Ng&nbsp;asked about the impacts of the reliefs and our considerations for extension. Firstly, I have laid out some of the considerations in my Second Reading speech earlier and want to assure the Member that we recognise that the relief measures are interventions into private contracts.&nbsp;The sanctity of contract is fundamental for Singapore and a key aspect of the rule of law. Hence, this is not a decision we take lightly.</p><p>In this exceptional circumstance, we need to intervene to safeguard and preserve the capacity of our Built Environment sector, by supporting the entire value chain.&nbsp;</p><p>The industry has also consistently provided feedback to us that the on-going moratorium on legal proceedings during the current COVID-19 pandemic has proven very useful in helping the sector focus on staying on its feet.</p><p>Mr Ng also asked about the percentage of parties that have been able to resolve their differences amicably and in a beneficial manner.&nbsp;</p><p>For construction and supply contracts, there have been about 1,100 notifications for relief filed as of 19 March 2021. Of those, only about 118, or about 10%, eventually applied for an assessor’s determination. This suggests to us that the majority were able to come to some satisfactory compromise on their own about contractual obligations affected by COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The relief provided under this Act, provides a framework for conversations to happen so that firms can amicably settle their differences and move the projects forward if they can do so.</p><p>Ms Sylvia Lim asked about Part 3 of the Act. To clarify to the Member, while the sunset period for Part 3 ends on 19 April 2021, nonetheless, the measures relating to insolvency in Part 3 had already lapsed in October 2020 as the prescribed period was from 20 April 2020 to 19 October 2020. These are exceptional measures that temporarily suspended creditors' rights to provide breathing room for financially distressed debtors to negotiate with creditors and pursue next steps, including for personal bankruptcy, the individual voluntary arrangement and debt repayment scheme; for corporate insolvency, out-of-court work-about schemes of arrangement, judicial management and simplified Insolvency Programme; for sole proprietorships and partnerships, the Sole Proprietor and Partnership scheme.</p><p>Such exceptional measures should be carefully monitored because the measures also affect creditors and therefore, flow of credit to other businesses.</p><p>There has been no significant increase in number of personal bankruptcy and corporate insolvency applications, comparing the figures for applications pre-COVID-19 and the post lapse of Part 3 measures in October 2020. We have been monitoring the situation and we will continue to monitor it.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Henry Kwek&nbsp;and Mr Louis Ng&nbsp;brought up the immediate challenge of manpower shortage faced by the industry. And I agree with both Mr Henry Kwek and Mr Louis Ng that beyond the temporary relief measures, it is important to address this situation.&nbsp;</p><p>To alleviate the current labour shortage in the construction industry, we are working closely with MOM and MOH to progressively increase the number of incoming workers, but in a safe way to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission in our dormitories and into our wider community.&nbsp;</p><p>I thank Mr Kwek for his suggestion to set up commercial processing facilities overseas to enable testing. Indeed, there are many operational challenges that we need to overcome to ensure reliable testing overseas. But we are actively in discussion with industry partners, including the Singapore Contractors Association Limited, or SCAL, and we are looking at how we can enable and establish better upstream processes to enhance pre-departure testing for workers in source countries.</p><p>I also agree with Mr Ng that there is value to retain experienced workers in Singapore as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as Mr Kwek has pointed out, there are also workers who want to go back to their families and there are indeed workers who went home and could not return or would not like to return.</p><p>But however, we are trying to keep as many of our workers in Singapore here in Singapore. In this regard, SCAL, with the support of MOM and BCA, has set up a Manpower Exchange, or SCMX for short, to facilitate a change of employer for construction workers, for workers whose contracts with their existing employers have either expired or terminated.&nbsp;This will help us retain the experienced workers who want to remain in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>On Mr Ng's suggestion to facilitate the re-hiring of workers who have returned to their home countries and want to come back to Singapore to work, we are very pleased to have them back in Singapore. And employers know who they are and have applied for them to re-enter into Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the constraint is not this.&nbsp;The constraint now and the challenge we are facing is how to allow these workers to come back, to re-enter Singapore in sufficient numbers to meet the industry's manpower needs, while minimising COVID-19 importation risks, so as to safeguard public health. We are working closely with MOM and MOH on these aspects.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Vikram Nair rightly pointed out that cashflow is the lifeline of the construction industry. BCA monitors the progress payments in the industry closely and receives frequent feedback from key developers and contractors. This is also why we need to extend the reliefs under the Act so firms do not get engaged in long-drawn litigations at this point in time.</p><p>During the circuit breaker period, most works were suspended and contractors received no progress payments. What we did to facilitate the cashflow was for Government agencies – and some private developers have also followed suit&nbsp;– to provide advance payment to help contractors tide through this challenging period. For public sector projects, we have provided at least $665 million of advance payment in total.&nbsp;The Government has also provided financial support, including waivers and rebates of the foreign worker levy, and subsidies for Rostered Routine Testing, or RRT for short.</p><p>Mr Vikram Nair also asked about co-sharing of additional costs for delays due to COVID-19 under Part 8B and how easy it is for such prolongation costs to be shared.&nbsp;</p><p>To facilitate such claims, BCA and SCAL have jointly developed a claims template and detailed guidelines, which are available on BCA's website.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, BCA has also been working with SCAL and other Trade Associations and Chambers, to streamline the claims process. This includes introducing an accepted method to estimate the delays to projects due to COVID-19. We will continue to work with the various stakeholders, including SCAL and other Government agencies to expedite the claims process.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, under Part 8B, contractors can also seek recourse for cost-sharing amounts that are due but not paid, through the existing adjudication mechanism under the Security of Payment Act, or SOPA, which the industry is very familiar with.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Don Wee suggested that we inform the industry and banks on extension of period where developers are prevented from calling on the performance bonds of contractors. Mr Wee may be pleased to know that the provisions for deferment of call of performance bonds is already provided for in the Act. MND and BCA have been in close contact with the industry and we have updated the industry on extension of arrangement under the Act, including through a press release.</p><p>Mr Don Wee also brought up the impact on the construction industry and it has affected home-buyers whose premises under construction have been delayed and who have to make alternative arrangements. And Mr Vikram Nair has also asked about the extent to which these purchasers have been affected.</p><p>The number of purchasers seeking reimbursement after Part 8C comes into operation in a few months will depend on the number of projects delayed and whether developers need and choose to tap on this relief. It is in the interest of developers for projects to be completed in a timely manner without having to tap on the relief.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, based on updates from developers for projects expected to be completed in 2021, most are still on track to meet their respective dates of delivery of possession.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We have also been encouraging developers who are unable to meet the date of delivery to first discuss with their purchasers and come to a workable and mutually agreeable arrangement, as this may result in a better outcome for both parties.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me assure Members that even as we provide relief to developers, we recognise that purchasers face challenges on their end as well, and we have structured Part 8C accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Under Part 8C, developers who face construction delays due to COVID-19 and require relief may serve a notice for an extension of the delivery date by up to four months, or 122 days, which is aligned with the period in Part 8A.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Don Wee asked why four months, why 122 days. This was also shared during the Second Reading of the COTMA Bill. It is because construction work stopped for approximately two months due to the circuit breaker period, and works were further delayed by at least another two months as all dormitories were only cleared in early August 2020. Therefore, adding two months together, two plus two, that is four months and 122 days.</p><p>Should a developer need further relief for the delivery date to be extended by more than 122 days, they can apply for an assessor's determination on the length of construction delay, that is, to a material extent, caused by COVID-19.</p><p>Mr Don Wee also asked about whether this relief will be applied to developments where HDB is the developer. I would like to share with Mr Wee that for HDB flats, purchasers can similarly claim up to 70% of the prescribed LD formula, which will be aligned with that of the formula stated in the Housing Developers Rules for private residential properties. This allows for co-sharing of such costs between the developer and purchaser. And if there is any dispute over reimbursement, both parties can seek an assessor's determination.</p><p>To also to reply Mr Don Wee's query regarding the assessors, similar to Part 2,&nbsp;the assessors making the determinations under Part 8C will be professionals with qualifications and working experience in the relevant fields, such as law, accountancy, finance, or building and construction. There will be mechanisms put in place to ensure that assessors declare any conflict of interest upfront.</p><p>Ms Sylvia Lim asked why Part 8C is not in operation yet and why amendments to Part 8C are being made at this juncture.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many urgent Parts to the amendment that we moved in November last year, including Part 8, Part 8A and Part 8B and we have made sure that those Parts are in operation as quickly as we can.</p><p>For Part 8C, we have been in active discussion over the last few months with the industry and partners that will run and operationalise the relief framework. And we are making amendments now as we incorporate their feedback in preparation for the operationalisation. We aim to streamline the process and help it be implemented more smoothly and more efficiently, given that it will be in effect for a longer period of time as compared to other reliefs under the Act.</p><p>Ms Lim will be pleased to know that the relief will apply to all affected agreements for the sale and purchase of housing, commercial and industrial property that meet the criteria stated in the Act, regardless of when Part 8C comes into operation. Hence, developers will be able to tap on it after it comes into operation in a few months and purchasers will be able to seek reimbursement then.</p><p>Ms Lim also asked how we will address the issue of fairness, given that legal representation will be not be allowed as a default under the assessor framework and she spoke in support of it. As with other Parts of the Act, the assessor mechanism is designed to provide for a quick and effective practical solution to disputes. The overarching role of the assessor is to make a decision that is just and fair in the circumstances and they have the power to ask for the appropriate information and documents from both parties, including information or documents not sought for by either party to achieve this.</p><p>Ms Lim raised the concern that a company may be represented by a legally trained employee.</p><p>In the first instance, we hope to minimise the need for developers and purchases to even require an assessor's determination and we will lay out clearly the qualifying costs that purchasers will be able to seek reimbursement for to make the process more efficient and easy for everyone. The Member will also know that in the ordinary case, if the matter were to go to Court, the company would have a right to legal representation.</p><p>Therefore, we have taken the position that for assessments, companies cannot be represented by lawyers. But there is a difference if you say that no one who is legally trained should come before an assessor. What if the individual purchaser himself is legally trained? The point is that the assessment framework weeks to give relief on very simple facts when there would otherwise be no relief. So, simple process, simple facts. In the first instance, we hope to minimise the need for them to come before an assessor to seek determination.</p><p>Mr Speaker, in conclusion, the amendments before the House today seek to provide continued support to the Built Environment sector to ride out the lingering impact of the pandemic. I thank Members and the industry stakeholders for their strong support for these measures and to continue to support the sector for staying on its feet.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Clarifications, if any?

(proc text)]</p><h6>4.20 pm</h6><p><strong>The Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information (Ms Sim Ann) (on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for Communications and Information, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"</p><p>Sir, the Postal Services Act, or PSA for short, was enacted in 1999. It was amended in 2007 to provide a legislative framework for the liberalisation of the Postal Services sector. Since then, market and technological changes, especially the rise of e-commerce, have transformed the postal landscape. While we might receive fewer letters now, more of us are shopping online and parcel deliveries have become part of everyday life</p><p>The volume of parcel delivery is expected to intensify given that domestic e-commerce parcel volume growth in Singapore is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16% from now to 2025. The existing letterbox infrastructure is not designed for parcel delivery. And the current market for locker infrastructure is fragmented and unable to support projected growth. It is thus timely to update the PSA in response to the evolving landscape of last mile delivery amidst increasing digitalisation.</p><p>Parcels are typically delivered to the doorstep. However, based on industry estimates, about 7% of deliveries are unsuccessful, causing inconvenience to consumers and reducing the productivity of delivery service providers, or DSPs. Self-collection parcel lockers are also currently concentrated in high-traffic commercial areas catering to only 5% of total parcel volume and leaving residential areas under served. These parcel lockers, which are operated by individual DSPs are also not accessible to other operators, resulting in a fragmented market and infrastructure duplication.</p><p>To enhance DSPs' productivity and efficiency of Singapore's urban logistics sector, my Ministry previously announced that 1,000 parcel lockers will be rolled out in HDB estates, MRT stations, bus interchanges and Community Centres and Clubs by the end of this year.</p><p>We carefully considered the options available in arriving at the solution. Currently, SingPost is the only public postal licensee, or PPL, and this arrangement has served us well in a time where the postal service was used predominantly for the conveyance of letter mail. The rise of e-commerce and a multitude of players in the logistics sector innovating and seeking to deliver value to consumers have ushered in a different era.</p><p>The vibrant last mile delivery sector has thrived with open and free competition and should be given room to flourish. It is therefore our priority to facilitate an environment where all players can participate equitably. An open access nationwide parcel locker network, or Network for short, which any DSP and e-commerce marketplace can use will provide greater convenience and options for parcel deliveries while complementing the existing letterbox infrastructure. To best serve the interest of consumers and the industry and to avoid conferring an unfair competitive advantage upon any single player, Pick Network Pte Ltd, or Pick, was set up as a fully owned subsidiary of IMDA to establish, install, operate and maintain the Network as public infrastructure.</p><p>This will ensure the neutrality of the Network and also allow it to be freely accessible to the industry and all consumers.</p><p>At this point, Sir, I would like to assure the House that it is not our intent for Pick to compete with DSPs. Pick is solely an infrastructure provider and operator and will not be involved in the conveyance of parcels, which is the core business of DSPs. Instead, Pick will give DSPs more options for the last mile delivery of parcels and increase their productivity and efficiency with fewer missed doorstep deliveries. The Network also includes an interoperability platform, which private locker operators can be part of.</p><p>Further, any DSP is welcome to use Pick's lockers. Pick has been working with all these partners to come on board the Network. This will ensure open and fair access to Pick's lockers, provide an opportunity for individual operators to extend their reach beyond their own parcel lockers and help level the playing field in the parcel last mile delivery market.</p><p>We are one of the first countries in the world with a nation wide open access locker network. In this Bill, we seek to introduce a regulatory framework which would facilitate the deployment of the network in a timely fashion as well as ensure the safety and security of the network</p><p>In addition, while the Network is operated by an IMDA subsidiary, there will be regulatory oversight of the Network and Pick under the Bill. The Bill also takes into consideration feedback from consultations with industry and the public. For example, a key change made was to allow the public to return their items at the Network's lockers at HDB estates and Community Centres and Clubs for greater convenience. This widens options for consumers and saves time and trouble.</p><p>Sir, I will be elaborating further on the key provisions of this Bill which aim to first, facilitate the deployment of a secure open access network for last mile parcel deliveries for consumers and DSPs. Second, level the playing field for the parcel last mile delivery market. Third, support the continuity of postal services by ensuring the provision and maintenance of letterbox infrastructure. And fourth, streamline and clarify existing provisions in the PSA.</p><p>The first set of amendments pertains to the Network while the other amendments address operational issues related to postal services.</p><p>First, amendments related to the deployment of the Network.&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 3A to set out IMDA's functions and duties with regard to the Network, which include ensuring that the Network is accessible, reliable, secure, affordable to use and well-regulated. Clause 11 introduces the new part 3A.</p><p>Today, IMDA as the postal authority, is conferred the exclusive privilege in relation to conveying letters and performing all related incidental services. The new section 23B gives IMDA the exclusive privilege of establishing, installing, operating and maintaining the Network. The new section 23C empowers IMDA to appoint a network operator to carry out the duties mentioned in section 23B, subject to any conditions specified by IMDA.</p><p>As a safeguard against any failure by the appointed operator to comply with the relevant provisions of the amended PSA or any conditions imposed by IMDA, the new section 23D allows IMDA to establish, install, operate and maintain the Network or any part of the Network.</p><p>The new sections 23H to 23K will introduce obligations on owners and developers of buildings or land designated as specified premises to provide suitable space or facilities and access thereto for the installation or maintenance of the Network. Given that space in public areas is already limited. Specified premises includes the public places where the public parcel lockers previously announced by my Ministry will be located.</p><p>The new sections 23M to 22O allow IMDA to issue codes of practice, written notices and written directions concerning the provision of an access to space for the Network. Non-compliance with any such written notices or written directions without reasonable cause is an offence.</p><p>Respondents to the public consultation on the draft Bill raised concerns on the safety and security of the Network, citing the possibility of hazardous materials and illicit items being placed into the Network's lockers. To address these concerns, the Bill introduces offences relating to the Network and converse enforcement powers in relation to these offences, which are largely similar to those in place for postal services.</p><p>For example, IMDA will have the powers to direct the network operator to search the Network's lockers and to detain any suspected harmful items found in them. If any item in the Network's lockers is suspected to pose a threat to public security or public health, the Police and authorised IMDA officers will have the power to search the Network's lockers and seize the item. It will also be an offence for any person to place a prohibited item as specified under the amended PSA in Pick's lockers.</p><p>Other offences are introduced to protect the Network and ensure the security and integrity of parcels being delivered into the Network.&nbsp;For instance, the new sections 39B and 39E make it an offence to damage or tamper with the Network to intercept or obstruct the delivery or collection of parcels, and to wilfully remove, destroy or damage the Network's lockers or related installations or related software.&nbsp;Under the new section 39H, officers, employees, agents or contractors of the Network operator or a DSP may also be penalised with a fine and/or jail term if they destroy, steal or throw away parcels in Pick's lockers, or wilfully open or cause to be opened parcels or lockers without authorisation.&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, I will now take the House through the second set of amendments aimed at levelling the playing field for the parcel last mile delivery market.</p><p>Some industry players have requested access to the letterboxes to deliver e-commerce items which can fit into existing letterboxes. We consider this to be reasonable, as wholesale access to letterboxes for letters is already in place today. Regulating wholesale access for the delivery of non-letter items also complements the introduction of the Network.&nbsp;Under the new section 7A, a PPL can be required via licensing terms and conditions to offer wholesale access to DSPs for the delivery of small packets and parcels which can fit into letterboxes, in addition to its existing provision of wholesale access for the delivery of letters.&nbsp;This will allow other industry players&nbsp;to have access to letterboxes, and provide consumers and the industry with more choices in the receipt and last-mile delivery of parcels. The amended section 24 will enable IMDA to regulate such wholesale access through codes of practice or standards of performance, including rates and charges. This will&nbsp;ensure that charges are fair and that consumers will ultimately benefit.</p><p>Let me now turn to the third category of amendments, which support the continuity of postal services by ensuring the provision and maintenance of letterbox infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>While the digital economy has changed the way we live, work and play, postal services still play a key role in communications and the conveyance of goods through the postal network, supported by a letterbox infrastructure.</p><p>Today, under section 16 of the PSA, building developers are required to provide letterboxes before a building is handed over to its owner.&nbsp;However, it is unclear which party is responsible for replacing letterboxes which are damaged or in need of repair, or providing additional letterboxes when a lot within a building is subdivided.&nbsp;Clause 8 amends section 16 to provide greater clarity on the provision and maintenance of letterboxes by introducing obligations on building managers, referred to as \"applicable persons\" in the Bill, to ensure that there will be no lapses in the delivery of letters due to inadequate letterbox infrastructure. Non-compliance with these obligations is an offence.</p><p>Sir, our review of the PSA covers a fourth and final area: streamlining and clarifying existing provisions to strengthen regulatory oversight of the postal sector. I will highlight key examples here.</p><p>Clause 4 amends section 5 such that persons providing an intra-organisational mail-room service or a messenger service are not required to obtain a licence under the PSA. This is in recognition of the fact that both are business support services with a narrower scope of activity than what licensed Postal Services Operators offer. Mail handling by such services is also not the core business of an organisation and mail volumes are typically low, at around fewer than 50 pieces a day, compared to the three million mail items that SingPost handles daily. This amendment will reduce regulatory obligations on companies with such services and aligns Singapore with other jurisdictions such as the UK, which does not license such services.&nbsp;</p><p>Clause 6 amends section 11 to clarify that only specified PPLs authorised under their licences may provide for the postal remittance of money. Similarly, clause 10 amends section 19 in relation to the issuance of postal stamps bearing the word \"Singapore\". These amendments cater to a scenario where there is more than one PPL.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Section 45 of the PSA allows the Minister to issue directions to any postal licensee in relation to the exercise of the licensee's functions under the PSA. Clause 17 amends section 45 to make it an offence for postal licensees to fail to comply with directions given by the Minister.&nbsp;The maximum fine for such an offence is $1 million, and a maximum further fine of $100,000 for each day or part of a day should the offence continue after conviction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sir, the proposed amendments to the PSA will ensure that a robust regulatory framework is in place for the Network, which will be key public infrastructure in our new e-commerce landscape. The amendments will provide the industry and consumers with the confidence to use the Network's lockers, and create an improved experience for DSPs and consumers alike.&nbsp;Stakeholders will gain clarity on requirements for letterbox infrastructure, and the urban logistics sector will also stand to gain from access to letterboxes. As e-commerce is a sector that looks set for further growth, these amendments are timely and will put us in good stead to capture opportunities in the digital future. Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>\t:&nbsp;Mr Patrick Tay.</p><h6>4.36 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Pioneer)</strong>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill, which amends the Postal Services Act. The amendments are a timely response to the evolving postal landscape due to the growth in e-commerce deliveries and accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>During the circuit breaker period last year, there was a sharp decline in face-to-face social interactions. As a result, many had resorted to purchasing parcels and gifts online to be couriered to friends and/or extended family as a means of keeping in touch with them. We also witnessed an increase in purchases made through e-commerce platforms, for work-from-home equipment such as monitors, desks, chairs and so on, and also essential items and groceries for household needs and use. If not for the instrumental role that the postmen and last mile delivery personnel played then and continue to play today, we would not have been able to receive our purchases and/or parcels from our friends and loved ones in a timely fashion.</p><p>However, as circuit breaker measures were lifted, and people started commuting more, there was a corresponding increase in failed doorstep deliveries. This has practical implications for the logistics services' providers as repeated deliveries have to be made, which is a drain on both time and resources. For recipients of the parcels, they would be inconvenienced if they needed the items urgently.</p><p>On my end, I also faced an issue for such deliveries. Just last month, my family had purchased a product from an online seller which cost less than $50. It was for an urgent use and we even paid for a special delivery package by SingPost for the item to be delivered to my home. On the day of expected shipment, even though the parcel was tagged and traced as delivered and I received a notification on the delivery, we eventually did not receive the item from SingPost.&nbsp;We contacted the seller and he said he checked and SingPost said they had delivered. I then had to contact SingPost to inform them that we did not receive the item and that it was for urgent use.&nbsp;The investigation took more than three days and we had to go ahead to make a repurchase due to the urgency. On the fourth day, we were told by SingPost that their postman had mailed the product to the wrong address.</p><p>There was little recourse for me, as the seller who had paid SingPost to carry out the delivery was supposed to be the correct party to file a complaint and/or claim with SingPost, even though I had already paid the seller for the product.&nbsp;Legally, I needed to file a claim with the seller who in turn needed to counterclaim with SingPost for the negligent act.&nbsp;</p><p>The multiple parties and various payments involved in this transaction made the recovery of that product or any ensuing claims a cumbersome exercise. I did not pursue the matter and&nbsp;I just had to settle with two sets of the same product.&nbsp;I believe I am not the only one faced with such a problem.&nbsp;</p><p>Some online companies or platforms do a better job by not releasing funds to the seller until the buyer receives the item. Such is the nature and challenge for e-commerce and online purchases. A serious situation of \"caveat emptor\". Perhaps the postal authority should re-look at such scenarios and establish better mechanisms for dispute resolution or mandate the way transactions are carried out so that buyers are not left with little or time-consuming recourse as many of these items may be of small or lower value purchases.</p><p>It is against this backdrop that I applaud this Bill which seeks to expand the scope of IMDA's exclusive privilege to include the installation and ownership of the Public Parcel Locker Network, hereinafter referred to as the \"Network\". There will also be powers for IMDA to appoint an operator for the installation, operation and maintenance of the Network.</p><p>I understand that the Network will be implemented in certain areas, namely, HDB estates, bus interchanges, train stations and/or Community Clubs managed by the People's Association. With the Network, postmen and delivery persons will deposit the parcels directly at the Network, for residents' collection at their convenience. The Network will cater to the growing demand of e-commerce purchases, while simultaneously alleviating the problem of failed doorstep deliveries.</p><p>While the Bill is no doubt commendable, I have some queries for the Minister, which may be broadly categorised into the following areas. One,&nbsp;security issues associated with the Network; two, convenience and/or public policy matters; and three, employment issues arising from the development of the Network.</p><p>First, security issues. From a security perspective, how would the Network be implemented? Would the Minister be able to share some of the technological safeguards in place to ensure that the parcel is not tampered with, given that multiple service providers have access to the same parcel box? Perhaps we could consider the installation of additional CCTVs? These are security issues which are less prevalent in the context of traditional letter boxes, where postmen simply slot letters into the letter boxes and only residents who have the keys to their letter boxes can collect the said letters.</p><p>Additionally, in cases of pilfering, be it by delivery personnel, pranksters and/or others who have access to the parcel boxes, who shall be liable for such losses and what recourse do the rightful owners have?</p><p>Further, we also note that certain prescribed classes of parcels will be prohibited from being placed in the Network for safety reasons. While there are powers conferred upon the Network Operator, the Police and IMDA to search, open and seize such parcels, however, how shall this be monitored and/or enforced practically, given that most of the parcels are usually packaged before being delivered? We need to ensure the safety of our postmen, last mile delivery personnel and residents who deliver and collect such parcels.</p><p>Second, convenience and/or public policy matters. Next, the Network is presently to be established at HDB estates and/or public areas. While residents living in HDB estates will no doubt stand to benefit from this initiative, are there plans to extend the same to those living in private estates and condominiums? Some private estates and condominiums are within proximity to HDB Housing estates and some may be keen to have these parcel boxes in their own precincts.</p><p>Additionally, how will MCI and IMDA provide the necessary support to residents, in particular, senior citizens to facilitate such transition and especially when the packages may be heavy and the intent for home delivery is to minimise the challenges of carrying the heavy load?</p><p>Third, employment issues arising from the development of the Network. From an employment perspective, while I am confident that the Network will make the jobs of our postmen as well as last mile delivery personnel less strenuous due to failed and repeated deliveries, it will also bring about a fresh set of challenges for our postmen and delivery personnel, such as adapting to technological advancements like enhanced tracking, electronic signatures and so on, and picking up new skill sets to multi-task and multi-skill.&nbsp;I am also particularly concerned about the wages, the welfare and work prospects of these postal and delivery personnel, in particular, the overall attractiveness of this sector which continues to play a crucial role as we navigate the pandemic, thrive in the next normal of a low touch economy and grapple with an ageing population.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to encourage employers to take a keen interest in the upskilling and retraining of workers and to transform and strengthen the image and professionalism of this industry as well as for our workers to continue to stay able, agile and adaptable, even as Singapore forges ahead with digital transformation.&nbsp;</p><p>On NTUC's end, we are committed to working with companies, through the development of Company Training Committees, to ensure that our postmen and last mile delivery workers are adequately trained to perform their delivery roles once the Network is established.</p><p>I submit that regulators and employers of these postal and last mile delivery workers to raise their wages, welfare, and work prospects as they are essential workers in the next normal of a low touch digitalised economy.&nbsp;Sir, clarifications notwithstanding, I stand in support of this Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Mr Gerald Giam.&nbsp;</p><h6>4.45 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Aljunied)</strong>: Mr Speaker, I can see the need for more parcel lockers to be set up near housing estates. Sometimes, deliveries get delayed because residents are not at home to receive the parcel, or they do not hear the courier at the door. This will require rescheduling to another delivery date. I also remember occasions when I would receive a delivery note in my mailbox to pick up a package from a POPStation, which is a 30-minute round trip by bus and foot from my home, when I had made it a point to be home when the original delivery was made.&nbsp;</p><p>The pandemic, ironically, seems to have ease this problem, because couriers, now simply leave the package outside the door in the name of contactless delivery to prevent the spread of the virus. However, I worry that these delivery issues may return once safe management measures ease. In any case, especially in public housing estates, leaving packages unattended at the door risks parcel theft.&nbsp;</p><p>I therefore support the plan to situate more parcel lockers near housing estates. However, I have several queries which I hope that Senior Minister of State will address. These cover the effect of the creation of public parcel locker network on market competition and innovation and the coverage of parcel lockers in all housing estates.&nbsp;</p><p>First, on market competition. While I welcome the creation of the Network, I would like to more clarity on the role of Pick Network Pte Ltd, in the existing ecosystem. Pick is a wholly owned subsidiary of IMDA, a which is a Government Statutory board. SingPost currently has POPStations, and Blu World Pte Ltd has a network of blue lockers. They are part of an existing parcel local network, the Locker Alliance, which has already set up parcel lockers in various locations across Singapore. What was the reason why IMDA did not contract these private sector players to provide more public parcel lockers near housing estates? They already have the experience of running parcel lockers and could take on the investment risk and bear the cost of expanding the network.</p><p>Is Pick's mandate to fulfil a need that is distinct and complementary to the services already provided by the private parcel locker providers, or will it be competing with them? If competition is part of this mandate, will it be contravening the Yellow Pages rule? This rule dictates that Government agencies should exit from market segments, which already have active private sector players.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><strong>[Deputy Speaker (Mr Christopher de Souza) in the Chair]</strong></p><p>I note that Senior Minister of State said that it is not the Bill's intent for Pick to compete with delivery service partners, but does this non-competition extend to providers of parcel lockers? Going back to first principles, I would like to find out more information about the process by which Pick was created and contracted to run the network.</p><p>Was there a public tender for the deployment and operation of a public locker network, which Pick eventually won?&nbsp;How long was the initial contract before? Are there plans for a subsequent tender, in which another public postal licensee or licensees can participate in? Is Pick expected to be profitable in future? If not, how much has IMDA spend and how much will it be budgeting every year to subsidise their operations of Pick?</p><p>Next, I have some questions for the Senior Minister of State about the location and coverage of the network lockers.&nbsp;While residents living in HDB estates will be served by the Network, how will the Network be implemented in condominiums and landed estates if at all? Will parcel lockers be set up in condominiums or in public spaces near condominiums? Given that 16% of resident households live in condominiums, we should strive to ensure coverage of this segment. Another five percent of residents live in landed housing. Will they be served by public parcel lockers?</p><p>Next, I understand that Pick will be in charge of the maintenance of these lockers. Given the COVID-19 situation, Pick should arrange for their own disinfection and cleaning of the high touch surfaces of these lockers regularly. Also, I hope that Pick clearly indicates that customer support contacts on their lockers and makes it convenient for customers to get in touch with them. This is so, that Town Councils or Members of Parliament do not get calls from members of the public to fix malfunctioning lockers.</p><p>There may also be certain individuals who are heavy users of delivery services&nbsp;– for example, people who run small redistribution businesses from their homes. What measures are in place to prevent overuse by these individuals who could end up monopolising the limited slots?</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, the public parcel locker network should fill in gaps, which the private sector is unable to fill, rather than duplicate their coverage. It should seek to drive innovation in the sector, for example, perhaps in future we could see the creation of cold lockers to facilitate the delivery of groceries and foodstuffs from supermarkets, or heated lockers for food deliveries.&nbsp;</p><p>Locker operators could also consider providing dual functions for their lockers, for example, as receptacles for return items or even depositing electronic waste, given that existing e-waste bins are even less accessible then private parcel lockers.</p><p>The creation of the Network should ultimately drive the industry forward and serve the public interest, given that public funds have already been used towards this creation. ROI must come in the form of more convenient and affordable parcel pick up for consumers; not just profits for a select few players, whether publicly or privately owned.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Ms Joan Pereira.</p><h6>4.51 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Joan Pereira (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the decision to install a nationwide network of parcel lockers is expected to be widely welcomed.&nbsp;Such lockers offer an additional mode of delivery to busy Singaporeans and residents who prefer to pick up their items in their own time and not have to wait for their deliveries at designated places as they may be on the move.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In order to increase the accessibility of these lockers, MRT stations and community centres have been selected as two of the main locations where lockers will be installed.&nbsp;This will indeed provide much convenience.&nbsp;As these are places where traffic is high, my concern is that hazardous materials which might cause harm and danger to commuters could be deposited there.&nbsp;How does IMDA ensure that no hazardous materials will be sent via the Network?&nbsp;Would the Ministry share with us the security process undertaken by the vendors?</p><p>Next, the bulk of these deliveries are transacted online.&nbsp;How do the vendors protect its customers' data from cyber threats, for example, hacking of their databases?&nbsp;Also, how can the vendors ensure the security of the deliveries, so that the items can reach the intended recipients?&nbsp;Had there been incidents where the locker systems were breached and thieves were able to make off with any parcels?</p><p>Finally, I would like to ask if the design of these lockers will be user-friendly for the elderly? With our rapidly ageing population, it is important to ensure that from the design stage, consideration of the needs of senior citizens is taken into account so that they can benefit from the set-up of these parcel lockers. For example, will it be possible to indicate elderly- and disabled-friendly lockers which are positioned at the appropriate height levels so that recipients can choose to have their parcels sent to such lockers?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I realise that many elderly may not know how to use these parcel lockers to retrieve their delivered parcels.&nbsp;Thus, it is important that a step-by-step guide in large fonts be placed at the parcel locker station area which is very visible and at eye level so that they can read the guide while unlocking the lockers.&nbsp;Sir, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20210405/vernacular-Joan Pereira Postal 5April2021 -Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Most parcels are ordered through online transactions. How will vendors protect the customers’ data from internet threats? Have there been any incidents of parcel locker systems being damaged or stolen from? Due to our rapidly ageing population, we must ensure that we consider the needs of the elderly from the design stage, such as installing usage instruction guides in big fonts near the parcel lockers.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Sir, I conclude with my support for the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Ng Ling Ling.</p><h6>4.55 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker Sir, I declare my role as a consultant in healthcare transformation.</p><p>I would like to begin my speech by sharing three numbers – 176,000, 16,000 and 11.&nbsp;What makes these numbers worth mentioning is that they are the numbers reported by Lazada from their 11/11 sale in 2020 for Singapore alone.</p><p>Specifically, in the first 11 minutes of the online sale, 16,000 items were sold every minute amounting to a total of 176,000 items purchased by Singaporeans&nbsp;in the first few opening minutes of the sale.&nbsp;The 2020 E-commerce Payments Trends Report for Singapore by JPMorgan estimated that the value of business to consumer e-commerce has grown from US$4.8 billion to US$6.1 billion, or a US$1.3 billion rise, between 2017 and 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The growth of e-commerce has resulted in more deliveries.&nbsp;Delivery service providers have had to step up to meet the increased volume and maintain service standards throughout the delivery process.&nbsp;We can expect this to be the new norm, moving forward, and hence, the introduction of the Postal Services (Amendment) Bill is a timely one.</p><p>The Postal Services (Amendment) Bill establishes a framework to build and operate a nationwide parcel locker network, or what I will call NPLN for short, to help domestic last mile delivery at scale.&nbsp;This is intended to benefit Singaporeans as delivery services will hopefully improve with increased access and reliability.</p><p>However, I have three clarifications to ask the Ministry in this proposed amendment Bill.</p><p>Like the hon Member Joan Pereira, firstly, I would like to ask will the parcel lockers have senior and disability friendly features and access, so that our seniors and persons with disabilities can also benefit from the convenience like everyone else?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to suggest adoption of assistive technologies as a requirement in the NPLN so that persons with disabilities and seniors can easily access the parcel lockers safely and confidently.&nbsp;Some specific accessibility considerations can include:</p><p>(a) placement of touchscreens that are convenient for the wheelchair-bound;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(b) pre-selection and designation of certain lockers for the wheelchair-bound, so that they need not worry about not being able to reach the locker for their packages; and</p><p>(c) to include speech and tactile interfaces for the hearing and visually impaired.</p><p>Another usage is for our ageing population.&nbsp;With more seniors aging-in-place, self-management and home-based care for the management of chronic diseases will become increasingly common and the last mile delivery of medication will be useful.&nbsp;SingHealth, together with Integrated Health Information System or IHiS for short, have developed their Prescription-In-Locker Box or PILBOX stations to allow patients to collect their medication refills anytime, without having to queue at the polyclinic pharmacies.</p><p>While this is a good solution, PILBOX currently is only available at five polyclinics under SingHealth.&nbsp;I would like to ask how far the NPLN can also be used to scale objectives like the PILBOX, for medication delivery, to bring convenience to our seniors?</p><p>My second clarification is similar to the hon Member Mr Patrick Tay's concern on how the security of the NPLN be effectively managed? In December last year, a hack on a service provider that maintained a network of package lockers across Moscow and Saint Petersburg resulted in more than 2,700 lockers being unlocked.&nbsp;While no packages were reported lost, the incident highlighted the need to ensure securing both the software and hardware from malicious actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I will like to propose to include stronger cybersecurity requirements for the NPLN.&nbsp;Some of these requirements could be in the form of cybersecurity-by-design in the software, hardware and infrastructure. This is to ensure that the cybersecurity best practices are adopted at the very start of the network implementation. Stronger penalties also to be in place specifically for cybersecurity related breaches to encourage operators and service providers to step up in their cybersecurity measures. And requirements for contingency plans to secure parcel lockers should a security breach happen, resulting in parcel lockers being compromised.</p><p>My last clarification is in the area of operating standards and interoperability of the NPLN.&nbsp;An open access parcel locker network will make pick-up and drop-off of parcels convenient for Singaporeans as they are not limited to any specific delivery service providers. I would assume that this will require common operating standards, compatible technology platforms or systems which delivery service providers would need to adopt to fully take advantage of the NPLN.&nbsp;I note that IMDA’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Pick Network, will ensure that the delivery service providers have fair and open access to the network .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, we will need to be mindful that such an arrangement will not stifle innovation, or worse, create an unintended monopoly by the network operator which may increase the cost of operations for the delivery service providers, especially if they are SME Internet merchants.&nbsp;I would like to urge IMDA to continually innovate and keep the NPLN open so that it can evolve together with the ever-changing demands of customers.&nbsp;I also hope that IMDA will allow the delivery service providers and SME Internet merchants to further innovate their solutions and apps on the NPLN for continued last-mile delivery innovations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The strong adoption of e-commerce by Singaporeans before and during the pandemic has highlighted the need to address inefficiencies, ensure reliability and scalability in last-mile deliveries.&nbsp;</p><p>With the continued growth of e-commerce, evolving consumer expectations, the Postal Services (Amendment) Bill is a welcome one.&nbsp;Nonetheless, as we put in place the infrastructure for tomorrow, we must not forget the needs of the seniors and persons with disabilities of today.&nbsp;As we build solutions for the future, we cannot afford to ignore the security risks present today.&nbsp;More importantly, the amendment Bill must prepare Singapore’s logistics network to meet the demands and complexities of the fast-growing e-commerce landscape.&nbsp;I hope that these efforts and my suggestions can help solidify Singapore as a mature and attractive e-commerce market in Asia.&nbsp;On that note, Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.02 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Janet Ang (Nominated Member)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, most of us would have experienced staying home to wait for a package to be delivered and it can be frustrating. Deliveries mostly happen during work hours. So, customers often miss the delivery window, then worry that their packages are not safe. And, with the increasing volume of e-commerce transactions which is projected to reach US$2.9 billion in 2021 according to Statisca, the urban logistics of getting the packages to the intended recipients is going to grow in complexity and, very likely, so in cost and carbon emission. I recall that, back in 2017, when I was still with IBM, the IBM Garage worked with the Singapore start-up, Freshturf, to study the issues from the first-mile to last-mile logistics and to explore technology solutions like blockchain to design the concept of federated locker networks and to create a secure way of making these lockers available to any delivery company wishing to use them. While this prototype never got commercialised, Freshturf co-founder Kevin Lim, did share that they learnt much from the prototyping and went on to develop solutions targeted for specific logistics problems.&nbsp;</p><p>We have come a long way since 2017 and COVID-19 has accelerated e-commerce even further. Hence, the Amendment to the Postal Services Act is very timely. Here are my thoughts on the three key points in the amendment.</p><p>The nationwide parcel locker network will transform Singapore’s last-mile delivery infrastructure. And the good part is that IMDA has implemented pilots in collaboration with e-commerce and logistics industry players in two HDB estates and the study has shown benefits for both consumers and industry players and the potential of a sustainable delivery eco-system. This is, in my opinion, an excellent example of public infrastructure that will ensure that all Singaporeans will be served as IMDA’s subsidiary, PICK, will install the locker networks in HDB estates, community centres and MRT stations and these will complement the commercial locker networks in commercial malls and office buildings.&nbsp;</p><p>Two, the PICK lockers will be accessible by all e-commerce and logistics service providers and, in so doing, facilitate competitive pricing and continued innovation of business models, services, regulation and technology adoption.&nbsp;</p><p>Three, there will be wholesale access to SingPost letter box infrastructure for non-letters, small parcels, under regulated terms and conditions. This will serve to level the playing field for delivery service providers as far as small parcels are concerned. In my view, another tick mark for this amendment.&nbsp;</p><p>In speaking with the Singapore Chamber of E-commerce, we have identified several areas which will still need continued adjustments. Some observations include the following.</p><p>One, many first- and last-mile operators are not doing well in terms of managing cost. The wholesale pricing of SingPost and the price of the PICK lockers can potentially help the operators on the cost side and we certainly hope that IMDA and the Government will help facilitate that.&nbsp;</p><p>Two, visibility of track and trace data of the packages for the consumers, coupled with the easy access for self-collection at lockers conveniently located near the consumers, will enhance end-user experience. Better user experience will increase the value consumers will be willing to pay for the service. So, my question is: how will IMDA ensure that PICK supports the smaller SME delivery operators to embrace digitalisation and improve productivity and, thereby, reduce costs ?&nbsp;</p><p>Three, logistics is a business driven by scale. We anticipate consolidation in the industry or the development of integrated services hub for urban logistics. How does the logistics Industry Transformation Map shape these developments?</p><p>Four, security is of increasing importance and, as my hon other Members of Parliament have mentioned ahead of me, how will PICK, SingPOST and IMDA handle the security checks of packages to ensure that there is no mischief? How will the PICK platform ensure interoperability with commercial players? And how will this platform enable our operators to go beyond Singapore?</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, notwithstanding these questions, I support the amendment of the Postal Services Act.&nbsp;</p><h6>5.07 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Don Wee (Chua Chu Kang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20210405/vernacular-Don Wee Postal 5April2021-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>I strongly support the Amendment Bill which will empower IMDA to install and manage our nationwide open access parcel locker network. With the Government in charge of the network, we can better harness the benefits of delivery aggregation and reduce facility duplication from competing private operators in certain locations.</p><p>This is a timely development in view of the exponential growth in e-commerce and the ever-increasing number of doorstep deliveries. It was estimated that the locker system will enable delivery drivers to make up to four times more deliveries per hour. This is a tremendous boost in productivity and will help solve the problem of manpower shortage in this sector. It will also greatly reduce our carbon emissions, in line with our environmental goals.</p><p>Presently, parcel lockers are mostly located in commercial areas and our residential areas are under-served since the private sector does not perceive it profitable to install lockers in housing estates. I welcome the plan to install 800 open access parcel locker stations in our HDB estates. This will bring much convenience to our residents.</p><p>For the SME suppliers, parcel lockers allow them to consolidate deliveries, which is efficient and save costs. I would like to ask if MCI would consider conducting a pilot to allow block-booking of a limited number of the lockers, for example, around 10 percent, so that certain retailers, such as online grocery shops, can have lockers as their \"shopfronts\" and advertisements at the stations.</p><p>(<em>In English</em>): Would the Ministry also consider installing cold storage parcel lockers, such as those set up in Finland? Groceries and temperature-sensitive parcels can be stored in closed, temperature-controlled lockers, which include freezer units.</p><p>I share the same hygiene concerns with Member Mr Gerald Giam earlier.&nbsp;The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of hygiene.&nbsp;In some countries, lockers are sanitised with UV light and disinfectant after each use. I would like to ask about the maintenance and cleanliness of the lockers.&nbsp;Would the Minister share the main details about which entity will be responsible for their cleanliness and how standards will be maintained?</p><p>I am concerned with the security of these locker stations. I am glad that Senior Minister of State Sim Ann has addressed the security-related concerns when she explained the policy intent just now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next, what technology will these lockers be equipped with for access?&nbsp;Lockers can be opened with PIN numbers sent by SMS, Whatsapp, QR codes or via Bluetooth with an app on customers’ phones.&nbsp;We need to ensure that everyone, no matter how poor, can access the lockers. I would recommend that we standardise accessibility as much as possible.&nbsp;For example, these lockers should be opened by PIN numbers in case people do not have smartphones, which are necessary for QR codes.&nbsp;On the other hand, with our nationwide push to being a SMART nation, will IMDA be assuming that everyone will be using smartphones?</p><p>Finally, I would like to share some ideas regarding the use of these lockers.&nbsp;In some countries, parcel lockers will be used for purposes, such as recycling, particularly, personal electronic devices, consumer-to-consumer sales and delivering rental devices.&nbsp;In Finland, customers can try on apparel in “fitting room” parcel lockers equipped with digital kiosks. In addition, can the National Library Board consider allowing its books to be sent and returned via this locker network so that disadvantaged children can also have easy access to books?&nbsp;</p><p>Notwithstanding the above concerns, I support the Bill.</p><h6>5.12 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Darryl David (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as Singaporeans become increasingly reliant on digital communications enabled by the Internet and various mobile messaging apps, the mail profile in Singapore has correspondingly changed substantially.&nbsp;</p><p>In the last decade, the mail volume of letters has declined by almost 30%. At the same time, the volume of non-letters, such as small packages and parcels, has increased – largely driven by the proliferation of online shopping platforms and changing consumption patterns. Although there is a certain nostalgia associated with receiving handwritten Christmas or Chinese New Year cards, we are now more likely to receive festive greeting GIFs on our mobile phones than physical greeting cards in our mailboxes. That is the reality of life.</p><p>In the era of Internet-enabled communications and given the ubiquity of online shopping, our postal services need to progress with time. A new framework needs to be set up to enable our postal service provider to meet changing patterns of communications and to close the last-mile delivery gap for small packages and parcels for consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>I am thus heartened to know that the amendments to the Postal Services Act have made provisions for IMDA to deploy a standardised national network of parcel lockers via a wholly-owned subsidiary or through an appointed vendor.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would imagine that parcel locker services are presently, at best, scattered across Singapore and are operated by different operators with differing operational standards and charges. This fragmentation would make it challenging for merchants to adopt a standardised approach to last-mile delivery and for consumers to have a reliable method to receive their parcels when they shop from different online merchants that might perhaps use different locker platforms, depending on their tie-ups and partnerships with those providers and vendors.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, I believe that market consolidation in the parcel locker service will help to minimise current market disamenities, such as differing operational standards, non-systematic deployment of lockers and deployment of competing lockers in already congested public spaces.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, we ought to be mindful about potential unintended consequences in IMDA’s implementation of such a nationwide service.&nbsp;</p><p>First, is there a possibility that a single player will end up dominating the market and, thus, the market is not subject to competitive market forces? In short, how can we ensure that the service will be affordable for consumers and that this single vendor – should there end up being a single vendor – will also continue to innovate and introduce new services when it is not subjected to competition from other vendors?</p><p>Ensuring long-term affordability of such a locker service is important because such a service is an effective alternative solution to door-to-door delivery. We have already heard from some of our colleagues about the challenges of waiting at home to receive some of their parcels and their deliveries. At the present moment, door-to-door delivery requires some degree of coordination also between merchants and consumers to ensure that someone is at home. This results in opportunity cost for consumers in terms of time lost as they must remain at home when their time could have been better spent on other activities.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, if the aim is to appoint a single vendor, then would this end up perhaps favouring large industry players that have the financial muscle and resources to tender and implement the project on a national level? Could this lead effectively to the demise of smaller players in the industry and perhaps even affecting door-to-door courier services adversely when demand for such services decline? Would IMDA thus consider working with some of the smaller industry players that might not necessarily run the nationwide network but is still able to contribute to its running in meaningful ways?</p><p>Thirdly, since the early 2000s, the Government has tried to minimise the installation of dustbins, for example, in crowded confined spaces, such as MRT stations or bus interchanges, as these receptacles could be used to hide improvised explosive devices (IEDs), which could lead to mass casualties – I am surfacing a point that has been repeated quite a few times already by my other parliamentary colleagues. So, the question is: how would IMDA ensure that the locker service will not be misused by nefarious individuals to hide hazardous biomaterials or IEDs that could cause mass casualties or widespread panic during an incident? How would the authorities ensure the safety and security of such a locker system?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, digitalisation has a pervasive impact on many aspects of our lives and has changed the way we communicate with each other and how we consume goods and services.&nbsp;My clarifications notwithstanding, I am heartened that the Government has introduced this Postal Services (Amendment) Bill to reflect the consumer landscape of today and conclude my speech in firm support of this Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Yip Hon Weng.</p><h6>5.18 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill is timely, with the growing popularity of e-commerce. It&nbsp;strengthens our last-mile parcel delivery infrastructure.</p><p>Most parcels today are delivered to the doorstep. It is&nbsp;convenient, but it comes with its own set of challenges. Delivery&nbsp;workers are always rushing to meet the deadlines for deliveries. This&nbsp;can compromise their work quality and safety when rushing from one&nbsp;point to another and parcels are left at the door, with contactless&nbsp;deliveries being encouraged. This opens up risks of theft. As such,&nbsp;having a better self-collection strategy in place is useful. This is&nbsp;particularly so in the current climate when social distancing is&nbsp;necessary and where there is an increased reliance on delivery&nbsp;services.</p><p>For this initiative to work, the Government needs to ensure the&nbsp;sufficiency of the lockers, at the local level. We also need to work out&nbsp;the processes to determine if a particular item should go into a locker,&nbsp;mailbox or direct to door. I will touch on two groups of people who are&nbsp;likely to be more affected by the Bill.</p><p>First, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have to cater to homebound residents.&nbsp;I have many of such residents in Yio Chu Kang who may have&nbsp;difficulties leaving their homes to collect their deliveries. These&nbsp;include seniors and, especially those with mobility problems. It also&nbsp;includes care-givers looking after babies and family members with&nbsp;special needs.</p><p>One senior in my constituency, Mdm Lim, is homebound due to&nbsp;severe arthritis. Living alone, she does not leave the house. She relies&nbsp;on VWOs for meal deliveries under the Meals-on-Wheels programme.&nbsp;She seldom checks her letterbox given her immobility. If the parcel&nbsp;station is not under her block, she will have great difficulty retrieving&nbsp;her parcels. We need to make sure that the system caters for such&nbsp;individuals as Mdm Lim.</p><p>During the circuit breaker, when home visitations were not&nbsp;allowed, many of my residents relied on e-commerce. This is to help&nbsp;their elderly family members to purchase necessities. Seniors could&nbsp;simply wait at home for their delivery to show up. In fact, some seniors&nbsp;in my constituency shared with me that they are learning to shop&nbsp;online. They enjoyed the convenience of door-step delivery so much. This is also a great opportunity to get seniors more comfortable with&nbsp;the use of digital technology.</p><p>I am concerned that as parcel lockers become more widely&nbsp;available, businesses may find that it is more cost-saving and cease to&nbsp;offer door-step delivery. Some could continue to offer it, but at a much&nbsp;higher cost. Therefore, this may come across as working against the&nbsp;segment of the population that, in fact, stands to benefit most from&nbsp;the convenience of e-commerce. As such, businesses, particularly&nbsp;those offering essential goods and services, should continue to offer&nbsp;door-step delivery as an option and, hopefully, not at an unreasonable&nbsp;premium. Savings on labour costs should be passed on to consumers.&nbsp;Can the Government share how much can logistics service providers&nbsp;expect to save, if they utilise this network?</p><p>As parcel lockers are typically accessed digitally, I presume this&nbsp;also applies to the Nationwide Parcel Locker Network. With the&nbsp;success of the trial in December 2018, will there be any changes to the system by which users retrieve their parcels? Are there plans to&nbsp;launch a public awareness campaign as the network progressively&nbsp;expands? How will the Government ensure that seniors and the less tech-savvy have access to assistance? Will there be a helpline in case&nbsp;a resident is unable to retrieve their parcel?</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my second and last point is about delivery&nbsp;workers. Member Patrick Tay has also spoken on this. Delivery is often cited as a job that is at risk of being&nbsp;automated. It will not come as a surprise that some delivery&nbsp;workers will find themselves displaced. Can the Government share&nbsp;how many delivery jobs will be affected as a result of the locker&nbsp;initiative?</p><p>Many delivery workers may be doing deliveries to supplement&nbsp;their income because their main job does not pay well enough to&nbsp;support their family. Some are in-between jobs, trying to get by as&nbsp;they find more stable employment. Some are care-givers who&nbsp;appreciate the freedom to accept delivery jobs when they can, as&nbsp;micro-jobs. How can the transition be made smoother for them? Does&nbsp;this new infrastructure project offer them opportunities to upskill and&nbsp;move up to a bigger jobscope within the logistics industry?</p><p>In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am glad that the Government is&nbsp;taking the lead with this network of public parcel lockers. When&nbsp;logistics service providers have access to well-planned shared&nbsp;infrastructure with the right processes, they provide a more efficient&nbsp;last mile delivery service for Singapore. But we must always remember&nbsp;those homebound residents, especially seniors, who have difficulty&nbsp;accessing these lockers. We must also remember the challenges faced&nbsp;by delivery workers as a result of this initiative. I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Sharael Taha.</p><h6>5.23 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, over the past few years, we have experienced the rapid growth of online shopping. This increase, as well as advances in technology, has also led to the development and growth of last mile delivery providers and participants.</p><p>As the e-commerce sector grows and online purchases become more prevalent, there is a need to look into a critical gap in the industry for the provision of parcel lockers. Currently, we have multiple players in a fragmented market, with others intending to join in to provide this particular last mile delivery service. Current parcel locker providers are extremely differentiated and unstandardised. They vary in terms of business, operations and subscription models, customer interface and even locker size. As a result, customers and businesses who use parcel lockers face multiple challenges trying to navigate through the variety of particular last mile delivery services.</p><p>With the provision of a nationwide parcel locker network via Pick Network Pte Ltd, we are able to provide standards and guidelines in order to protect customers and businesses. As mentioned by a few Members – Ms Joan Pereira and Ms Ng Ling Ling – there is a need to look into issues of accessibility for seniors and the less abled, as well as physical and cybersecurity requirements, particularly since we anticipate the sector to grow even further in the coming years. In the near future, customers using such services should have ease of access, which is to say, there should be sufficient parcel locker locations, making it convenient for customers to receive and collect their parcels in a safe and timely manner.</p><p>Currently, the custody of a parcel goes from seller to last mile delivery riders before it ends up with the customer. With the new proposed network, last mile delivery riders may no longer have direct contact with sellers and, instead, deposit parcels into lockers at designated locations. Therefore, from the moment the parcel departs from the seller until it arrives safely in the hands of the customer, it is essential to protect sellers, last mile delivery riders, customers and Pick Network from wrongful claims in the event of damage to the parcel even whilst in transit.</p><p>We must especially keep in mind the delivery riders who currently deliver direct to customers. Customers receive the parcels in good condition and this protects the delivery riders from fraudulent claims. However, with the current proposal, delivery riders will deliver to parcel lockers. How can we ensure that the delivery riders are protected when the parcel is damaged between the point of him/her completing the delivery to the parcel lockers and the customers retrieving the parcels?</p><p>I have met a few delivery riders who are exceptionally cautious when delivering parcels and resort to taking pictures of the recipient receiving their parcels to ensure that he/she is safe from any claims of damages to the parcels as such fraudulent claims may pose a significant financial loss to the delivery riders. Assuming delivery riders earn less than $5 dollars per successful delivery, if a fraudulent claim of a damaged parcel worth $100 is made on him, it will mean he loses his entire income for a day or two. Thus, we must ensure a robust and reliable system of parcel delivery, with proper recourse, should parcels be damaged or lost.</p><p>Notwithstanding the need for a robust and reliable system to safeguard all the stakeholders involved, through the provision of such lockers, the common practice of delivery staff taking pictures of customers receiving parcels or even taking pictures of customers' homes upon delivery of parcel to avoid being unfairly penalised for parcel damage or as proof of delivery, will no longer be necessary. This would be of great benefit in terms of protecting the customers' privacy, too.</p><p>Another consideration that we should take note of is that, in the current market, each service provider operates independently, providing their own physical lockers which vary in terms of size and accessibility. They also often service only their own propriety platform, for example, Ninja Van lockers. If two or more competing service providers are at the same location, such as with Ninja Van and Bluport, it may result in under-utilisation of lockers and inefficient use of space. Provision of a nationwide parcel locker network and allowing access to these assets to last mile delivery operators would help promote more effective use of valuable space. This is in line with the current trend of co-sharing assets to promote its efficient utilisation, such as that seen on platforms like AirBnB, Grab and MoBike.</p><p>Additionally, in locations that experience a high volume of parcel delivery, we can also consider piloting the use of Automated Storage Retrieval Systems (ASRS) that are more volumetrically efficient at storage and has a more efficient physical footprint. With economies of scale, ASRS may also enable the use of technology to capture the condition of parcels at the point of delivery to ensure that there are no wrongful claims and disagreements between buyer, seller, third party last mile delivery providers and Pick Network.</p><p>Current businesses and customers face a 7% failed delivery rate at doorstep. Access to network of lockers will enable last mile delivery providers to increase their successful delivery rate. Hence, delivery companies can do more for the same amount of resource. There is the potential for less failed delivery and, hence, less wastage on travel times, leading to savings in fuel and operating costs. Consequently, this will also be beneficial for businesses and deliverymen who may only be paid upon successful delivery.</p><p>Parcel lockers also help improve individual productivity. Customers are better off as they no longer have to remain at home in anticipation of a delivery. We can also consider an accompanying messaging app to inform recipients that their parcel has been safely delivered at the respective collection points so that they can be retrieved. The faster the turnaround time for these lockers, the higher the capacity for the network. With this in mind, will there be a time-bound constraint for the use of these lockers? Will customers be charged accordingly? Are there any other costs incurred by businesses and customers using this facility?</p><p>Beyond costs, there are other considerations to these parcel lockers. Firstly, who will have access to these parcel lockers? Will it be limited to only some last mile service providers? Will small businesses or homebased businesses that do their own delivery for costs reasons have equal access to these facilities as it can potentially help with their operations and costs? How viable is it for us to extend the use of such facilities to them?</p><p>Can we also consider extending this service to parcel pick-ups and parcel returns, too? This is an additional service that is provided by current parcel locker players and I think we should provide such a service, too.</p><p>A final consideration would be, with the increased use of packaging, which will inevitably increase with the growth in ecommerce, how do we use these platforms to promote our Green Plan recycling effort? Can we have reminder posters at parcel lockers, or else, incentivise the proper disposal and recycling of packaging?&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Malay, please.</p><p>(<em>In Malay</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20210405/vernacular-5 Apr 2021 - Mr Sharael Taha - Postal Services (A) Bill.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Over the past few years, we have experienced the rapid growth of online shopping. This increase, as well as advances in technology, has also led to the development and growth of last mile delivery participants.</p><p>As the e-commerce sector grows and online purchases become more prevalent, there is a need to look into a critical gap in the last-mile delivery industry.

Previously, when the delivery rider delivers directly to the customer, the customer receives the parcels in good condition and this also protects the delivery riders from fraudulent claims. However, with the current proposal, the delivery riders will place the parcel in&nbsp;designated lockers. How can we ensure the delivery riders are protected when the parcel is damaged between the time when the parcel is placed in the locker to the time when the customer retrieves the parcel?&nbsp;</p><p>For delivery riders earning less than $5 per successful delivery, fraudulent claims can affect their income. Fraudulent claims may cause delivery riders to lose their entire income for a few days. Thus, we must ensure a robust system of parcel delivery and a claims process that is fair to all parties.&nbsp;</p><p>Notwithstanding, with the provision of a nationwide parcel locker network, we can promote a more effective use of space. It also prevents parcel locker providers from allocating their lockers to specific platforms only. This can also increase the number of successful deliveries.</p><p>Finally, it also represents a responsive adaptation by our postal service to remain relevant in light of the growth of e-commerce and the decline of mail volume as a result of increased digitalisation.</p><p><em>(In English):&nbsp;</em>In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the deployment of a nationwide network of parcel lockers in specified premises has many advantages and benefits to businesses, customers and last mile delivery providers. It is also a responsive adaptation of our postal service in light of the growth of e-commerce and the decline of mail volume as a result of increased digitalisation. The amendments to the Postal Service Act will ensure the continued relevance of our postal service to future generations of Singaporeans. With that Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding the clarifications above, I support the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Gan Thiam Poh.</p><h6>5.33 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the amendments to the Postal Services Act which will lead to the installation of a network of parcel lockers islandwide.&nbsp;While such lockers, also known as automated parcel machines, or APMs, may not be able to replace the role of couriers who compete by delivering right to the doorstep, they offer a convenient service to those who prefer to pick up their parcels at time slots convenient to them.&nbsp;With this option, they do not need to ensure that they are waiting at their residences or offices in order to receive their parcels.&nbsp;In addition, this arrangement will certainly help provide better service with increased productivity and efficiency.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that IMDA consider developing a nationwide network of pick-up and drop-off points, in short, PUDO, in collaboration with neighbourhood shops, convenience stores, retailers, petrol stations, Residents' Committee and Neighbourhood Committee and clubhouses to supplement the APM network.&nbsp;PUDOs, which require no installation, can be set up more flexibly and can help to cope with increased delivery volumes during peak hours when the demand for APMs is high and they get filled up quickly, such as during the Christmas season.&nbsp;</p><p>I also hope that the Ministry will work with condominiums and private estates to enhance the out of home delivery options for them, through a combination of APM and PUDO locations.&nbsp;Deputy Speaker, in Mandarin.</p><p>(<em>In Mandarin</em>)<em>: </em>[<em>Please refer to <a  href =\"/search/search/download?value=20210405/vernacular-Gan Thiam Poh Postal 5April2021-Chinese.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Vernacular Speech</a></em>.]<em>&nbsp;</em>Parcel lockers will alleviate the problem of manpower shortage in this sector. I would like to ask how many postmen we have and how many are currently employed by private logistic and courier companies? What are the plans to train and upskill this group of essential workers, and how are we supporting them by tapping on technology, such as robotic delivery assistants?</p><p><em>(In English):&nbsp;</em>The Bill is comprehensive and ride on other existing legislation to counter mischief and security threats.&nbsp;Would the Ministry share with the House how many such cases have been detected and deterred in the past?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What has the Ministry done and invested in to ensure that our system is robust against security threats? Will the Government invest more in such security measures and software development?&nbsp;Finally, had there been many unclaimed parcels to date, especially parcels which are the result of mischief? With that, I conclude with my support for the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Louis Ng.</p><h6>5.37 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon)</strong>:&nbsp;Sir, this Bill ensures that our postal sector remains responsive to trends in the market. On one hand, with many transactions now going paperless, the volume of letters sent through the post is decreasing. As one example of this trend, just in December last year, Ikea announced that it will be discontinuing its iconic Ikea paper catalogue after 70 years.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, parcel deliveries has grown with the booming e-commerce sector. A study done in 2020 noted that Singapore's business-to-consumer e-commerce market has been growing at a double-digit rate since 2017. Already, the growth of e-commerce has strained our postal system which was mainly designed for letters.</p><p>In 2019, SingPost was hit with a record $400,000 fine for failing to meet delivery standards. SingPost attributed the lapses largely to the rise in parcel deliveries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The amendments to the Postal Services Act are timely for responding to consumer trends. The new public parcel locker network will also help to ease the load on our postmen and postwomen who work tirelessly to ensure that the postal system runs smoothly. Sir, I have three points to raise on this Bill.</p><p>First, the Bill will introduce a nationwide network of public parcel lockers at HDB estates, public transport hubs and community spaces.&nbsp;Ahead of this Bill, IMDA announced that it will roll out 1,000 parcel locker stations. The public parcel locker network is intended to complement commercial parcel locker network in private residential and commercial spaces. However, the scope of the public parcel locker network is extensive. This locks the private parcel locker networks out of a significant portion of the market. As a result, this may stifle innovation by the private players.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Private parcel locker operators have been in the market for some period of time. The industry is also fairly competitive with many options available to consumers. With the introduction of the public parcel locker network, how will the Government continue to ensure that both public and private parcel locker network players remains competitive and continues to innovate?</p><p>&nbsp;Second, the new section 23R will allow the Postal authority to open and search a public parcel locker. It will also allow the Postal authority to detain and open any parcel in a public parcel locker. This, is to mitigate risks to public safety and is consistent with the approach for postal articles.&nbsp;MCI and IMDA have also stated that they will require the operator of the public parcel locker network to put in place security measures including video surveillance and presence sensors in the locker compartments. I understand this will also include cybersecurity protection measures. Additionally, there is also collaboration with MHA and SCDF to ensure that the locker design and parcel handling meets safety and security requirements.</p><p>However, the powers for the Postal authority in section 23R and the security measures announced for the public parcel locker network do not necessarily apply to the private parcel locker networks. The security risks that threaten the public parcel locker networks similarly apply to private ones. Can the Minister clarify what measures will be in place, aside from existing Government powers under other laws, to address security risks for private parcel locker networks?&nbsp;</p><p>Third, the proposed amendments will implement Regulated Wholesale Access which means that SingPost will be required to deliver small packages for other delivery service providers into letter boxes. The intention is to level the playing field for delivery service providers in the last mile delivery market. However, many delivery service providers currently provide parcel tracking services, where the parcels can be tracked throughout the journey.</p><p>With Regulated Wholesale Access, the parcels will be handed over to SingPost for the last mile of delivery into the recipients' letter boxes. Without compatible tracking systems between the delivery service providers and SingPost, it may not be possible to track parcels throughout their delivery journey. This was a concern raised by Ninja Van in response to the public consultation for the Bill. This would represent a step backwards in terms of the quality of delivery services offered to consumers. Can the Minister clarify whether the Ministry or IMDA has looked into how the trackability of parcels can be maintained throughout the delivery process? This may be particularly important given that there is an additional point of handover of the parcels from the delivery service providers to SingPost, which increases the risks of mistakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Further, given that there are technologies available on the market to track the delivery of postal articles, is the Ministry or IMDA looking into how tracked deliveries can be made the default in the Postal system?&nbsp;Right now, consumers have to pay premiums and go through additional processes for the tracked delivery of letters or parcels. If the technology is readily available, why not implement it across the board. The volume of postal articles that go through the postal system will help in spreading out the costs of implementation. Sir, notwithstanding these clarifications, I stand in support of the Bill.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Senior Minister of State, Sim Ann.</p><h6>5.42 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank Members for their support for this Bill, and for their questions on important issues that this Bill seeks to address.&nbsp;</p><p>Members' responses and questions fall into two broad themes, namely first, what we are doing to ensure citizens and consumers can fully benefit from the deployment of the nationwide parcel locker network or the \"Network\"; and two, what we are doing to enable businesses to reap productivity gains from the Network, while safeguarding it against cybersecurity threats.</p><p>Let me begin with the first theme, on providing a convenient, secure and inclusive Network that can be used by residents of all ages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In my opening speech, I spoke about how the Network is an efficient solution that provides greater convenience and more options for parcel deliveries beyond doorstep delivery.</p><p>We note Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Gerald Giam's query about whether there are plans to deploy Pick's lockers at private estates and condominiums. Parcel lockers can help achieve efficiencies in residential estates with sufficient density, and which are currently under-served. This is why Pick's rollout plan is focused on HDB estates. Some private condominiums are already being served by a commercial parcel locker operator, who has agreed to join the Network. Pick will encourage its partners to expand their deployment wherever feasible, so that more locations, including private condominiums, can be served. Private estate dwellers, including those who live in less dense estates, which might not be ideal for parcel locker deployment can also benefit from Pick's lockers deployed near them, especially those at public transport nodes and Community Centres or Community Clubs.</p><p>There was also a question raised by Mr Gerald Giam about the siting of the parcel lockers. Pick will focus on rolling out the Network in areas that will be convenient for the public. In looking for ideal locations for these parcel lockers, Pick has taken on feedback from the ground, including all town councils in determining suitable locker sites in HDB estates. It is also working closely with MOT and LTA to review data such as transport ridership, while taking into account operational, safety and security requirements, to identify suitable locker sites at public transport nodes.</p><p>Mr Darryl David has also raised a concern about the pricing for parcel locker use. I should highlight here that the charges for the parcel locker will be charged to the DSPs and the consumer may or may not actually see what these charges are because usually the consumer will interface with the e-commerce marketplace. And as to how this is then translated into the consumer price, we leave this to the workings of the e-commerce marketplace, the sellers as well as the DSPs.</p><p>However, I should highlight that from Pick's perspective, in order for us to achieve the kind of efficiencies that we envision for the entire urban logistics sector, it stands to reason that the prices offered to the DSPs has to be affordable. Because if it is not affordable, there is no way to make a good business case ultimately to the consumers and we might still default to doorstep delivery, and that is what we are trying to change here. Pick is very conscious of the importance of making the numbers work and to offer a vey attractive business case so that the DSPs will find it worth their while to use these parcel lockers.</p><p>Mr Yip Hon Weng has expressed a concern that widespread use of parcel lockers might cause businesses to cease offering doorstep delivery. In fact, it is precisely because doorstep delivery is manpower intensive and not sustainable as a long-term default that we believe businesses are likelier to continue to offer doorstep delivery at a reasonable rate to consumers if they are able to achieve productivity gains elsewhere, such as the kind of productivity gains we anticipate from the deployment of the Network.&nbsp;</p><p>I should also add that we are heartened by the residents engagement surveys that Pick has been undertaking thus far, and in the surveys, residents have indicated other considerations apart from the price that they will be seeing on the e-commerce marketplaces for why they would use Pick's lockers. Ninety-six percent of residents indicated that they would use Pick's lockers due to reasons such as the convenience of 24/7 self-collection and the confidence of being able to access their deliveries safely rather than having their parcels being left at their doorstep unattended. With this kind of response from residents, we feel that we are on the right track.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Louis Ng asked whether IMDA is looking into how the trackability of parcels can be maintained throughout the delivery process given our amendments to implement regulated wholesale access of small packets and parcels into letterboxes. Please allow me to clarify that today, other DSPs are already able to hand over their packets and parcels to SingPost for delivery into letterboxes on commercially negotiated terms on a tracked basis. Hence, consumers' ability to track the delivery of their packets and parcels to letterboxes will not be affected by this amendment.</p><p>Some Members asked about the safeguards in place to mitigate security risks such as the placement of harmful or hazardous items in Pick's lockers and items placed in the parcel lockers being tampered with given that multiple DSPs have access to them. The Act already contains provisions upholding mail security. Similarly, we will also guard against mischief and tampering in the parcel locker setting. We are working closely with MHA and SCDF to develop security guidelines and requirements to ensure that the locker design and parcel handling workflows meet required safety and security standards.&nbsp;</p><p>To Mr Patrick Tay's query on how we are monitoring and enforcing the placement of prohibited items before they are delivered to Pick's lockers, he may wish to note that parcels sent from overseas are screened by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA). For domestic parcels, Pick has worked with DSPs to ensure that they have safeguards in place to prevent the placement of prohibited items in the lockers. IMDA will be empowered to issue written notices to Pick in relation to Pick's compliance with security requirements and guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>Relatedly, the new section 39J makes it an offence for a person to place prohibited items in the Network's parcel lockers. The classes of prohibited items will be expressly set up in subsidiary legislation.</p><p>In terms of deterrence measures, IMDA has required Pick to put in place security measures to mitigate risks to consumers. Mr Patrick Tay will be glad to know that each Pick locker station will include two CCTV cameras with round-the-clock video surveillance, which will aid potential investigations into any incidents of theft.</p><p>Mr Don Wee may also wish to note that locker compartments will have presence sensors to alert Pick if items appear in the lockers that are not supposed to be there, or if locker doors are not securely fastened. Mr Louis Ng may also wish to note that today, the Police has the powers to investigate the contents of lockers belonging to Pick and private sector operators if they need to. Nonetheless, we have taken into account public safety and security considerations in designing Pick's lockers. We will consider Mr Louis Ng's suggestion to explore how the security risk for private lockers can be further mitigated.</p><p>Mr Sharael Taha asked about protection for delivery riders in the event where parcels delivered are damaged or lost through no fault of theirs. We believe that in general, the introduction of Pick's lockers would reduce the volume of disputes arising from parcel damage or loss as the CCTV cameras on Pick's lockers are able to capture the delivery process.</p><p>Delivery into Pick's lockers would also provide more assurance compared to missed doorstep deliveries where some parcels are left unattended for a period of time. We will monitor the situation and if necessary, work together with DSPs to educate delivery personnel on proper delivery of items into the parcel lockers.</p><p>On Mr Patrick Tay's suggestion about providing greater recourse for e-commerce bias in the event of failed doorstep deliveries or missed deliveries, the current industry practice is for the e-commerce retailer to ensure the proper delivery of the item to the consumer through its shipping contract with a DSP. In this regard, Enterprise Singapore and the Singapore Standards Council have launched the Technical Reference 76 (TR 76), which outlines e-commerce retailers' responsibility among others on the handling of lost or damaged items during delivery to protect consumers' interests. My Ministry and IMDA are cautious about introducing a formal regulatory framework for parcel delivery services at this point as we do not wish to raise compliance costs unnecessarily, which could also translate into an increase in prices faced by consumers.</p><p>Given the existing measures, we will work with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) on how to promote the adoption of these best practices among e-commerce businesses and to improve consumer awareness of their rights in e-commerce transactions.</p><p>As we transform our infrastructure to support greater digitalisation, it is important to ensure our efforts are inclusive. To this end, Mr Sharael Taha, Mr Don Wee and Mr Yip Hon Weng may wish to note that access to Pick's lockers will be a simple affair even for those without a smartphone. Similar to the IMDA led Locker Alliance pilot, users will be notified via SMS or email on the arrival of their parcel and will be able to access the lockers via a one-time PIN issued by Pick. A helpline will also be available for residents who face trouble retrieving their parcels.</p><p>Mr Sharael Taha may wish to note that consumers have up to three days to retrieve their parcels from the parcel lockers, after which they will have to make arrangements with the DSPs to pick up their parcels. This was deemed as a reasonable timeline based on the findings from the Locker Alliance pilot.</p><p>Ms Joan Pereira, Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Yip Hon Weng asked about what we are doing to support residents, especially seniors, in the use of the Network. We believe that seniors who are able to make purchases online are also very likely to be digitally ready to use the Network. Nonetheless, we will have digital literacy measures in place to support residents in the use of the Network. For example, we will add a segment on how to use Pick in IMDA's Seniors Go Digital programme. At the same time, we will widen the reach of the Seniors Go Digital programme which has trained over 69,000 seniors in digital skills to date to give even more seniors the confidence to embrace e-commerce. We also thank Ms Ng Ling Ling on her useful suggestions regarding disability friendly features and access to Pick's lockers. We are working on these options, including making the selection of wheelchair friendly lockers an option for consumers when they check out for their e-commerce purchases.</p><p>Moreover, to broaden our outreach to residents of all ages, we also intend to leverage IMDA's events aimed at raising Singaporeans' digital literacy such as the SG Digital Wonderland when the COVID-19 situation improves.</p><p>In terms of use cases for Pick's lockers, I am also very glad to hear the strong interest from Members as well as their various suggestions. Let me share that Pick and the National Library board are exploring the possibility of allowing residents to borrow and return library books through Pick's lockers. Ms Ng Ling Ling, Mr Don Wee and Mr Gerald Giam had also made similar suggestions on temperature-controlled locker units to facilitate delivery of medication, groceries and other kinds of temperature-sensitive goods. These are useful suggestions, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic when doorstep delivery for supermarket purchases and medicine becomes a practical option for many households.</p><p>While there are some examples of refrigerated or temperature-controlled locker units overseas, these are mostly deployed on a trial basis or on a very small and localised scale.&nbsp;For instance, many new condominium units in Tokyo have parcel lockers, but only a handful of buildings are installed with refrigerated lockers. Pick is studying the feasibility of including such units for some of its lockers. For now, Pick is engaging retail chains on the possibility of using its parcel lockers to deliver non temperature-sensitive products to residents.</p><p>Mr Don Wee and Mr Gerald Giam may also be pleased to note that Pick is in talks with industry players for its parcel lockers to be used as collection points for recyclable e-waste as part of our effort to reduce Singapore's carbon footprint. And as for the returns of parcels, yes, this is already catered for, and in fact this is the reason why we made the amendment in the Bill.</p><p>While Pick's lockers will not facilitate consumer to consumer sales and exchanges due to security reasons, Pick will continue to explore other innovative and sustainable use for its parcel lockers. Mr Gan Thiam Poh had made a suggestion with regard to pick up and drop off points, and asked if it is possible for Pick to also enter into a network of Pick Up, Drop Off Points (PUDOs). Right now, PUDOs are operated mostly by private sector players and Pick has no intention of entering this sector.</p><p>I should also take this opportunity to mention that although there may be some PUDOs that operate on a 24/7 basis, many do not, and in fact, this was also one of the reasons why in our early studies of urban logistics that it was decided that we consider building up a network of parcel lockers that consumers can access 24/7 because this would be more convenient compared to some pick-up and drop-off points which may have limited operation hours.</p><p>Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, we also agree with Mr Don Wee and Mr Gerald Giam that ensuring the cleanliness of Pick's parcel lockers is crucial. While Pick is responsible for the maintenance of the parcel lockers and will ensure that the lockers are cleaned regularly, we urge consumers to maintain personal hygiene when using the parcel lockers as they would with any other piece of public infrastructure.</p><p>Let me now address the second theme which pertains to enhancing business productivity while safeguarding the Network against cybersecurity threats. Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Darryl David have spoken about Pick's role in the urban logistics eco-system. Against the backdrop of a flourishing last mile delivery sector, the current private sector driven market for parcel lockers is largely fragmented with competing players deploying their proprietary networks, which are accessible only by selected DSPs. This has given rise to deep inefficiencies for locker operators. The lockers are duplicated at high-traffic commercial locations, and e-commerce marketplaces and DSPs are unable to access all lockers which may be available.</p><p>Mr Yip Hon Weng asked about the productivity savings that DSPs can expect to enjoy from utilising this network once the inefficiencies that I have mentioned previously have been addressed. Based on the Locker Alliance pilot which started in 2018, participating DSPs reported a four-fold increase in delivery efficiency with just 70 parcel locker stations, established in two HDB towns and eight MRT stations.</p><p>With a nationwide Network of 1,000 parcel lockers stations, the potential productivity gains for the industry will be significant. However, these gains can be realised only if two key factors are met. First, the Network will need to be deployed expeditiously so that scale and network effects can be realised. Second, the Network should be deployed by a neutral operator to ensure open and non-discriminatory access for the industry. In fact, this point was expressed by industry stakeholders during consultation.</p><p>We listened to the voices from the industry and we very seriously considered having a neutral operator that industry stakeholders will have confidence in, in providing that open access to everyone. We believe that these twin objectives that I have outlined would be best served by a Network operated by the Government – in this case, it would be IMDA – and to give effect to this intention, IMDA formed a subsidiary, Pick.</p><p>Having Pick, an IMDA subsidiary, operate the Network will allow IMDA to directly manage locker placements and deployment timelines while ensuring prices are reasonable and affordable. As a subsidiary, Pick will have the flexibility to undertake commercial decisions and nimbly respond to market dynamics, while balancing the interests of the Network as a public infrastructure. Second, this would provide the assurance that DSPs and locker operators are looking for, which is the neutrality of the Network, while factoring in both consumers' and the industry's needs in the administration of locker operations.&nbsp;</p><p>We would like to thank Members for their support for greater innovation and their various suggestions to this end. Mr Sharael Taha suggested piloting the usage of automated storage retrieval systems. In response, we could review the commercial viability of incorporating such technology into the Network's parcel handling process after the Network has been established and its operations stabilised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Ng Ling Ling, Mr Louis Ng and Mr Gerald Giam asked about whether the amendments which accord exclusive privileges to Pick will entrench its market dominance and stifle the industry. Let me clarify that our intention is not to put Pick in a favoured position.&nbsp;Pick's exclusive privileges are confined to the provision of parcel lockers at specified premises only. In this regard, the Network, which would be available for use by all e-commerce marketplaces and DSPs will serve to complement, but not compete with existing locker offerings from the industry, which are accessible only by selected operators. As Pick will not be involved in parcel delivery, it will also not compete with DSPs in this segment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As I mentioned in my opening speech, the Network is linked to an interoperability platform which will connect DSPs and e-commerce marketplaces with the Network's parcel lockers. While the digital platform will enhance the user experience for the industry and consumers, Ms Ng Ling Ling and Ms Joan Pereira raised important points about the need to safeguard the Network against cybersecurity threats. This issue was also raised by the industry during our public consultation. Pick will have to comply with requirements set out by IMDA to ensure the resilience and security of the Network before, during and after the deployment of the Network. For example, the software component will be subject to vulnerability testing by independent cybersecurity experts, before the parcel lockers are available for use.&nbsp;</p><p>During and after deployment, IMDA may set out detailed obligations by issuing codes of practice and/or directions in relation to the installation and operation of the Network. This may include setting out cybersecurity requirements pertaining to the Network, for Pick's compliance. We will carefully review Ms Ng's suggestions for additional measures where required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Janet Ang and Mr Darryl David have also spoken about how businesses could be better supported to use the Network.</p><p>As I mentioned in the opening speech, the Network will provide the industry with public e-commerce infrastructure that will give more options for last mile delivery. The strong support from and partnership between Pick and various industries stakeholders are crucial for the Network's success. To this end, Pick has undertaken various initiatives to onboard DSPs and e-commerce marketplaces.&nbsp;Ms Janet Ang will be glad to note that&nbsp;that these include supporting DSPs and e-commerce marketplaces to integrate their systems with Pick's one-stop access to all lockers in the Network, joint promotions with e-commerce marketplaces to encourage consumer adoption and featuring partners in Pick's marketing campaigns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Don Wee's suggestion of allowing small and medium-sized retailers to block-book a limited number of lockers to serve as retailers' \"shopfronts\" and advertisement space is an interesting one. Pick will consider carefully how such a concept could be implemented.</p><p>Mr Sharael Taha may also note that Pick's Network is open to all DSPs. Small and home-based businesses keen to use Pick's lockers can work with any DSP registered with Pick to drop off their parcels at Pick's lockers for delivery to their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Gerald Giam had also raised a scenario in which perhaps the locker space would be taken up by a specific player and this is something which Pick does intend to monitor in terms of the usage volume of is lockers in different locations. Where there are locations that have been shown to have very high demand, then pick would have to make operational decisions about whether to situate more lockers nearby or to expand the existing locker stations.</p><p>Pick is also exploring with its industry partners on ways to address their cross-border fulfilment challenges, in a bid to help them tap on a larger e-commerce market beyond Singapore. And I believe this also addresses a point that Ms Janet Ang was alluding to.</p><p>As we work closely with the industry to use the Network for greater productivity gains, we also agree with Mr Patrick Tay and Mr Yip Hon Weng that it is important to work with employers to ensure that our postal and DSP delivery personnel are well-trained and well-equipped to operate in this new environment. Projected e-commerce growth will continue to intensify the demands for last mile delivery services, and by extension, delivery workers. So, the question is not so much whether delivery workers will be displaced, but how we can help them enjoy better prospects. As Members would know from many previous discussions in this House, increased productivity is an important precondition for upgrading jobs and uplifting workers.&nbsp;</p><p>While the Network strives to fulfil its role in achieving productivity for all DSPs that it partners, we expect DSPs to also play an active part in training and equipping their workers, drawing on the comprehensive upskilling measures administered by the MOM family of agencies. Through this partnership, we hope that the Network will help to bring about better jobs and better prospects for delivery workers.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I believe I have substantively addressed the issues that Members have raised.</p><p>In conclusion since the PSA was first enacted 22 years ago, the landscape has changed significantly and we have also taken corresponding strides in transforming our postal sector. Taken together, the amendments in this Bill to effect nationwide deployment of lockers in tandem with the changes pertaining to letterbox infrastructure and regulation of postal services, will ready us for the digital and technological shifts in our postal landscape. They will enable us to embrace the global search in e-commerce while putting us in good stead to cope with manpower constraints in the sector with a more skilled and better-equipped postal workforce ready to face the challenges of the digital age. These will ultimately benefit consumers and the industry alike. Mr. Deputy speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Gerald Giam, you have a clarification?</p><p>I propose to take just about 10 minutes for clarifications so that other Members will have the opportunity. So, we can keep them short. And then, we can move on to the Motions.</p><h6>6.09 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.&nbsp;I thank the Semior Minister of State for the comprehensive answers to my questions. I just have one clarification.&nbsp;In the long term, will Pick be profit-oriented, or will it be subsidised by IMDA? Or will it be eventually spun off like SingPost was?</p><p><strong>Ms Sim Ann</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in answer to Mr Gerald Giam's question, at this point in time, our focus is in establishing the operations of Pick and having their processes stabilised. The lockers in fact will be going live, we hope, later this month. So, I think we are in very early stages yet.</p><p>However, what I can share is that we do intend for it to become a well-functioning part of the eco-system. We do believe that there are certain gaps in the market that do need to be plugged so that the previous inefficiencies that we have described, will then be eliminated but we do not intend for this to be done at the expense of long-term subsidies. So, the Pick team is working very hard to ensure that they are able to deploy the parcel lockers at the right spots. And that in terms of the adoption by the e-commerce marketplaces and the DSPs, that it is sufficient in order to create the kind of economies of scale to make this project a success.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Any further clarifications? If not, I shall put the question.</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to. (proc text)]</p><p>[(proc text) Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. (proc text)]</p><p>[(proc text) The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. – [Ms Sim Ann].

Subsequently, we will still move and take the second and third Motions separately in compliance with Parliamentary procedural requirements.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Yes, I give my consent to one debate, and then, three votes.</p><p><strong>Mr Ong Ye Kung</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p><p>As part of its mandate to ensure the stability of the international monetary system, the IMF provides financial assistance to countries experiencing balance of payments difficulties. To carry out its functions, the IMF relies on resources provided by member countries.&nbsp;Singapore has been contributing to these efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>Arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the IMF has seen a surge in requests for financial assistance, especially from low-income countries. IMF has, therefore, called on its members to help bolster its financial resources to assist the most vulnerable members in recovering from the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The amendments to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, approved by Parliament on 11 July 2016, enables MAS to make grants to the IMF as part of international efforts to assist low-income countries.&nbsp;This is subject to three conditions, as specified under the Act. First, such financial assistance is part of a collective action amongst IMF member countries; second, MAS publicly discloses key information about the financial assistance; and third, Parliament fixes, by resolution, the maximum amount of the grants.</p><p>I will now explain the context and considerations for the three grants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>First, Singapore's grant to the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust, or CCRT.&nbsp;</p><p>The CCRT was established in 2015 to provide debt relief to the IMF's poorest and most vulnerable members in the event of a natural catastrophe or global health pandemic. The relief on debt service will free up scarce financial resources to continue strengthening the eligible countries' medical care capacities and address the social and economic fallout from the pandemic.</p><p>The CCRT is in urgent need of replenishment. Its pre-COVID balance was US$200 million.&nbsp;Since the onset of the pandemic, the IMF has disbursed over US$500 million in debt relief to CCRT-eligible members.&nbsp;So, the pre-COVID balance has been completely depleted.&nbsp;The disbursements were made possible through the additional contributions by other member countries, which has amounted to US$800 million so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The IMF has requested for Singapore to contribute US$17.6 million, or SDR 12.3 million, to the CCRT. This represents about 1.2% of the total amount of US$1.4 billion or SDR 1 billion, needed to replenish the CCRT. Singapore's contribution is based on our quota share at the IMF and similar to how other countries' contributions are determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Second, the COVID-19 Crisis Capacity Development Initiative, or CCCDI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's grant to the newly launched CCCDI will help to meet the urgent capacity development needs of countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>The objective of the CCCDI is to help these countries develop effective policies to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic and support economic recovery.&nbsp;This comes in the form of technical advice, practical tools and policy-oriented training to build skills to manage the crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>IMF has reached out to member countries, including Singapore, to seek funding support for the CCCDI, and suggested that Singapore make a contribution of between US$2 million to US$4 million.&nbsp;MAS proposes that Singapore contribute a one-off grant amount of US$2 million, or SDR 1.4 million, to the CCCDI. It represents 2% of the total amount of US$100 million needed to support the CCCDI.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, contribution to the trust for Special Poverty Reduction and Growth Operations for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries for Somalia's debt relief, or PRG-HIPC Trust.&nbsp;</p><p>The Trust will provide support for the debt relief of Somalia, which is in urgent need of assistance. The majority of IMF member countries, including the ASEAN-4 countries, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, have already committed to contributing to Somalia's debt relief package.</p><p>The IMF has requested Singapore to contribute US$0.97 million (or SDR 0.68 million).&nbsp;Singapore already holds funds in the other IMF accounts to cover overdue payments incurred by&nbsp;members which are unable to pay and the contribution will be drawn from these accounts.&nbsp;Singapore's contribution would form approximately 0.3% of the IMF's financing package of US$344 million (or SDR 242 million) for Somalia's debt relief.</p><p>Why are we making these contributions to the causes of the IMF?&nbsp;In short, we live in an interdependent world and Singapore needs to do its part.&nbsp;</p><p>Particularly, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for decisive and urgent collective actions to manage global crises.&nbsp;As a highly open economy, Singapore has a strong stake in ensuring that the world contain the pandemic, restore people-to-people connections across the world and support global economic recovery.&nbsp;By contributing to the three funds I have mentioned above, we can play our part as a stakeholder of the international community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The grants to the CCRT and the CCCDI will reduce the size of Singapore's Official Foreign Reserves by a total of US$19.6 million (or SDR 13.7 million). As explained earlier, the grant to the PRG-HIPC Trust will not affect the size of Singapore's Official Foreign Reserves.&nbsp;The proposed grant amounts are also reasonable and commensurate with Singapore's position and role in the global economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, MAS has issued a press release on 31 March 2021 to inform the public of the grants and that it would seek Parliament's approval. Following Parliament's resolution to fix the maximum amount of grants that MAS can allocate to the IMF's CCRT, CCCDI and PRG-HIPC Trust, MAS will publish in the Gazette key information about the grants. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p>[(proc text) Question proposed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Assoc Prof Jamus Lim.</p><h6>6.23 pm</h6><p><strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Sengkang)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, the three Motions to contribute to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust, Crisis Capacity Development and Trust for Special Poverty Reduction and Growth for HIPC initiatives are an important step towards contributing to the commons as responsible citizens in our global village. But I will go further: as a country that has historically hung its hat and been a major beneficiary from globalisation, I would argue that doing so goes beyond responsibility, and is instead a duty and an obligation on our part. If anything, we are not doing enough and I wish to explain why we should do more.</p><p>I should, of course, state at the outset that I have previously worked for seven years in the trenches as an economist in a Bretton Woods Institution and I maintain a small balance in my self-funded group retirement account and the staff account at the credit union. However, I do not receive nor maintain any direct financial interests in the Bank nor the Fund.</p><p>As Members of this House are undoubtedly aware, despite our globalised footprint, Singapore has no formal foreign or development aid agency, and we do not, as a rule, channel any share of our Budget towards official development assistance. Nor do we have any concerted strategy for increasing our representation at international organisations, such as the United Nations (UN). </p><p>For instance, we send a total of 64 staff to the UN system, 0.1% of the total or 0.001% of our population. Compare this to the 506 staff sent by Sweden, a country about twice our size, or the 559 sent by Denmark with a population comparable to ours.</p><p>Most of our citizens are narrowly affiliated with just two institutions – the IMF and the World Bank. Apocryphally, this position was motivated by our founding father, former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who was reluctant to risk the brain drain that could result when our talents went abroad to work at these international institutions.&nbsp;</p><p>Our legacy of ambivalence extends to our pocketbook. Remarkably, the official reason for our unwillingness to extend official aid is because, and I quote, \"Singapore is a developing country and does not provide official development assistance. We undertake South-South capacity building programmes with other developing countries.\" The multiple rounds of assistance offered under the aegis of the Singapore Cooperation Programme has, undeniably, been welcomed by other nations in need, but it is befuddling that we would remain unwilling to extend financial resources to other countries, beyond merely technical assistance. </p><p>To be fair, Singapore has also largely eschewed the receipt of foreign aid. But even so, historical development assistance inflows have come to a non-trivial amount. Statistics provided by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD reports that between 1960 and 2004, Singapore received a total of US$14.4 million every year on average. This amount, while uncorrected for inflation, nevertheless represents a net receipt of funds from the international community over the course of our modern history. </p><p>What is more, Singapore may yet be set to receive an additional US$5.33 billion, or S$7.17 billion, worth in new SDR allocations, were a new proposal by IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva be accepted by the IMF Executive Board. This amount actually far exceeds the comparatively small amounts that we are formally extending to the Fund today.</p><p>To be fair, foreign aid has a mixed record and there is no clear evidence that foreign aid can reliably raise economic growth. Often, the reason is because of politics: donor countries tie aid to specific requirements, which may not be the most beneficial use for the recipient country. Or the governments which receive such foreign aid become more responsive to their foreign benefactors, as opposed to their own people.</p><p>But by the same token, aid can be effective when it is conditional, albeit not by making it contingent on certain uses specified by the donor, but by extending support to countries that we observe exercise good policy. Aid can also be channelled to responsible multilateral organisations with a good track record of ensuring that the funds they receive are properly utilised.</p><p>And if we are still reticent to provide aid because it would be managed by external parties, we can always direct the funds towards the formation of an international volunteer corps tasked to provide social and economic development assistance to other countries, especially those in ASEAN.</p><p>So, the key, as in all good investments, is to carefully direct our foreign aid dollars towards initiatives that take into account returns but adjusted for risk.&nbsp;Indeed, countries, such as Luxembourg and the United Kingdom, demonstrate that it is possible to be simultaneously generous, as well as principled, in one's foreign aid practices.</p><p>Let me be absolutely clear: charity begins at home. We must take care of our own needs first and we should prioritise these needs. In crisis times, this is even more pertinent, as many Singaporeans are facing hard times and it is difficult to convince them that we should be looking out for the well-being of those in other nations. And indeed, this impression is not unique. When citizens from countries around the world are asked how much they think their country contributes, they systematically over-estimate this amount, compared to actual disbursements.</p><p>So, we are certainly not unique in wanting to look out for ourselves first, and all the more during crisis times. But generosity has its own reward and I believe that we are more than capable of doing both. We should not think that just because we are in crisis mode, we neglect planning for the future. And that future must, surely, entail thinking about the performance of economies besides our own. </p><p>Because even from a purely self-interested perspective, uplifting our neighbouring economies can pay dividends in the long run. After all, what we export shows up as another country's imports. When the economies in our region grow richer and faster, they will increase the demand for all goods, including exports from us. And when their incomes are elevated, their consumers are better able to afford our goods and services, which skew towards those of higher value.</p><p>Generosity can also increase our soft power, our ability to influence the global agenda in ways that go well beyond our small size. Smaller nations understand this dynamic. The Netherlands, Switzerland, Qatar and the UAE know that they are able to punch above their weight because they have invested in multilateral organisations and in the international system. And if we establish a formal international volunteer corps, the experience gained by our returning volunteers will also contribute toward our goal of promoting greater sensitivity toward regional integration efforts.</p><p>Given how citizens' perceptions are that donor governments give more than they actually do, it seems like a short logical step to infer that what they generally want is less, not more foreign aid. But this inference would be misleading.</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, the same study I referenced earlier also asked respondents how much aid they would like to see their countries giving. And these desired amounts actually fall short of how much donor-country citizens think is given and far short of how much they actually give.</p><p>The reason, I think, is because we are fundamentally social creatures, and some degree of reciprocity and altruism is baked into our moral fibre.&nbsp;We are often willing to help those less well-off than we are, so long as we can afford it and so long as we are assured that the money is well-spent. But if we accept this premise, then I would submit that a more concerted effort to increase our official development assistance is essentially a problem to be resolved, rather than an insurmountable obstacle.</p><p>Given the thrust of these overall remarks, then it should be no surprise, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am wholly in favour of all three Motions.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Mr Liang Eng Hwa.</p><h6>6.32 pm</h6><p><strong>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in a crisis of this magnitude and scale, every country should play our part to combat this global pandemic. COVID-19 respect no borders or jurisdictions and all countries, big or small, strong or vulnerable, do get impacted in one way or another and we are in this together. In particular, countries in a better position should do our part to help those that face difficulties during the crisis, including the economic fall-out from the pandemic. In the thick of the pandemic last year, Singapore stepped up to contribute diagnostic test kits, PCR machines, protective gears, thermal scanners to neighbouring countries.</p><p>Singapore is also an early supporter of the COVAX facility with a US$5 million contribution to help ensure equitable access of vaccines for all countries.</p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, besides the fight on the healthcare front, it is also in our interest to support the global economy recovery efforts and to do our humble bid to improve the well-being of the global community, especially in the developing countries. I support the three Motions to approve US$20.57 million to support the three specific initiatives alongside other member countries' contribution in response to the request by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p><p>This is all part of the collective global action to help the most vulnerable countries during this major humanitarian crisis. The IMF is the most suitable international agency to carry out these efforts given its multilateral platforms as well as expertise, organisation and their suite of programmes available.</p><p>The IMF has always been among the key financing agencies to ensure stability of the international monetary system such as assisting countries with the balance of payments difficulty.</p><p>As an international financial centre and a global trade node, Singapore's interest is best served when there are financial stabilities, stronger monetary cooperation amongst countries and sustainable economic growth.</p><p>I can imagine that as a result of the pandemic. IMF would have been inundated with more requests for assistance, especially from the low-income countries.</p><p>Not withstanding my support, can I ask the Minister a couple of questions? Firstly, what are the considerations in deciding whether Singapore should contribute to this requested round of funding by the IMF? Secondly, do we have visibility as to how IMF will utilise this funding?</p><p>Sir, Singapore is a highly open economy and we have a strong stake in ensuring that the world contains the pandemic, restore people's connectivity and movements, and support global economic recovery. By contributing to these three funds, we will play our part as responsible stakeholders of these international communities. So with that, I support the three Motions.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;Ms Mariam Jaafar.</p><h6>6.36 pm</h6><p><strong>Ms Mariam Jaafar (Sembawang)</strong>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing global economic slowdown has made clear just how connected we are and that no one can overcome this disease or its impact alone. Just has been the case domestically, COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable countries internationally. The impact on health, education, food security, and livelihoods is staggering. And these are cascading outcomes. Millions of children are at risk as routine vaccination programmes have had to be deprioritized and more children are also dropping out of school, especially girls. Decades of progress reversed.</p><p>So, protecting the vulnerable is needed to fight this global pandemic, fuel global economic recovery and growth, and to maintain social stability and peace. The successful and inclusive response now can set us all up for a better future. So, there is, as my colleagues have said, a clear, moral and economic imperative for private, public and social sectors to work together.</p><p>Yet, we have seen the continued rise of nationalism and protectionism, and multilateralism continues to weaken. Declining levels of official development assistance and rising levels of debt are also impeding the world's ability to pay for efforts to realise global sustainable development goals. The poorest countries hardest hit by COVID-19 will also face a debt crisis.</p><p>Singapore is acutely aware of the connectedness and the importance of multilateral efforts. Multilateral cooperation and multilateral institutions like the IMF remain the best way to tackle global challenges, whether it is COVID-19, future pandemics, economic slowdown or climate change. So, their success is vital to us.</p><p>We have also seen what remarkable things can be achieved when the world does come together. For example, in what Prime Minister Lee termed \"Vaccine Multilateralism\", leading to COVID-19 vaccines being developed in record time. So it is important to rebuild and recommit to multilateralism. Sir, I support MAS' intent to respond to IMF's call to support the most vulnerable low-income countries impacted by COVID-19.</p><p>I am also heartened by two aspects of the proposed support. Firstly, that the grants will go towards not only immediate relief to fight COVID-19, but investments in healthcare systems and crisis capability development that will strengthen preparedness for future epidemics and crises. Secondly, that the assistance goes beyond debt and debt suspension to grants and clearing arrears where a country's debt level is no longer tenable.</p><p>I hope that the IMF will also be flexible and responsive in the detailed design and implementation to address any potential stakeholder concerns and maintain support for the grants from member countries and recipients. And just as Prime Minister Lee's call helped to shape the global conversation around equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, that the voices of our leaders such as Senior Minister Tharman, will help shape how the world helps low-income countries.</p><p>Beyond increasing our development assistance though, I would like to propose two strategies to go in parallel.</p><p>The first is to increase awareness and appreciation of our international assistance efforts among our people. Our youths have grown up in a connected world. They understand intuitively the imperative for us to do more to assist the most vulnerable. So, we must show the next generation that we are listening and that we have heard them. And for the skeptics, we must continue to demonstrate to our people that our international assistance efforts can make us all better.</p><p>Secondly, we can encourage more of our people and our businesses to learn expertise and participate in the development and implementation of assistance programmes on the ground, particularly for lower-income countries in the region. This will help our people understand the region better and support our regionalisation and internationalisation efforts, bring us back to where I started, that the world is interconnected. With that, I support the Motion.</p>",

            "content": "<p>[(proc text) Debate resumed. (proc text)]</p><p><strong>The Minister for Transport (Mr Ong Ye Kung)</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the generosity of time.&nbsp;I hope I do not have to use it. I thank the Members for their support for the three Motions.</p><p>Let me try to answer some of the questions raised, starting with Mr Liang Eng Hwa who asked the reason for doing this. I think the simplest reason is we are helping the most vulnerable countries in the world. We are talking about countries like Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Nepal, Tanzania, Yemen, where the pandemic has really ravaged lives and livelihoods. And so, something like the CCRT will help, through debt relief, free up much-needed resources to tackle the medical, social, economic problems that they are facing.</p><p>If we take a step back, the reason is really that we live in an interconnected world. And so, it is in Singapore's interest to be part of this international community where we work together, where we cooperate, where there are rules, there are norms, there are best practices that hold every country into account to ensure that we live peacefully together in a global village.</p><p>So, in such a system there will be benefits, there will be obligations. And on balance for a small city-state like us, the benefits far outweigh the obligations and the costs. In fact, it is existential for us to live in such a global international cooperation system. That is why we want to do this.</p><p>Is there visibility? Yes, all the funds are subject to the oversight of the IMF Executive Board. Singapore is represented in the Board through the voting group of Southeast Asia. And so, we get an update and from time to time the IMF would publish reports, to update on the progress of all these funds.</p><p>I thank Assoc Prof Jamus Lim for supporting this Motion and for giving us this lecture about how for a small country, it is much better for us to help others and make sure that if the region, in poorer countries do well, so will we. And in fact, I think what he has just described, is 50 over years of foreign policy and one of our key tenets – which is we want our neighbours to all do well, we want our region to do well. That way, there is global cooperation that a small country like us, can also do well.</p><p>Which is why for so many years, we contribute on various international fora, whatever we can do within our means as a small country. Today, we talked about IMF, but for many years, MFA had the Singapore Cooperation Programme. We do not contribute money per se, but we run so many training programmes and invite government officials, representatives of NGOs and other organisations to come to Singapore. We provide necessary training, they take reference on what we do, we learn from each other. And I think it started in 1992. As of now, we have trained more than 130,000 officials all around the world, at our expense.</p><p>Today, I am in MOT. I can see that whether it is ICAO or IMO, we have participated in all kinds of capacity building programmes, contributing to the greater common good. We talked about the Paris Agreement, we had launched the Green Plan and had a long debate on the Motion on climate change. And w<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\">e too, contribute to the Paris Agreement.</span></p><p>Our contribution is always commensurate with our size. It is not big. But I think it is important for us to contribute and it is beyond money. Often, it is about our know how. We learn by doing, and whatever we have learned, we share with the world. And sometimes, those are the lessons that are priceless. Likewise, we learn those lessons from others and those are priceless.</p><p>Assoc Prof Jamus Lim did say we should increase our monetary contribution. In the IMF, it goes by your voting rights and your quota. There is a formula. We go by that formula. But, of course, if you contribute more, the fiscal burden is higher and it has to be funded by tax collections as well. For us, as a small country, our stance is better not to go around to say that we have all these resources, we can give out more money. But instead, we are always struggling for relevance, always fighting to earn a living. And along the way, we learn many lessons and we can share those lessons with the rest of the world. I think this is a better way for Singapore to contribute to the common good and the larger global society.</p><p>Ms Mariam Jafaar gave a couple of good suggestions on raising awareness and educating the broader public including businesses on the work that we do internationally and how much Singapore can help. I think these are very good suggestions. When MAS put out our press release on these IMF contributions, it was a little bit disappointing because if you look through the threads, there were quite a few criticisms saying, \"Why is Singapore giving out money to other countries?\"</p><p>Frankly,&nbsp;within MAS, when we reviewed that, we were a little bit disappointed. So, I am quite glad that today, all the Members that stood up and spoke about this, supported this contribution to the IMF grants. It shows that as a small country, we can also be big-hearted, that we can also play our role. I think we also share our concern for the future of humanity and we will do our part. What Ms Mariam Jafaar suggested is a good idea and we will see what we can do to raise awareness of what we can do internationally.&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.</p><p><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:&nbsp;No clarifications?</p><p>[(proc text) Question put, and agreed to.

The E&amp;C sector will be at risk of being downsized or even displaced from Singapore, with its resultant impact on jobs, if we transit too hastily and the E&amp;C companies could not transform and decarbonise their operations sufficiently.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">But the E&amp;C sector can also be a beneficiary of the low-carbon transition. For example, the chemicals industry provides silver paste, high performance plastic films and membranes that go into photovoltaic cells and batteries for electric vehicles. The E&amp;C sector is also a key partner in the development of emerging low-carbon technologies, such as carbon capture, utilisation, and storage. These technologies can be pivotal in enabling decarbonisation at scale.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Government is committed to supporting our E&amp;C companies as they adapt to a low-carbon future.

            "content": "<p>22 <strong>Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Manpower (a) what are the re-skilling programmes that cater specifically to former oil and gas workers that are currently available or under development; (b) whether there are any available financial support schemes for workers who participate in these programmes; and (c) whether the Government will develop roadmaps for higher education programmes based on the expected emerging jobs in sustainability sectors.</p><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;Companies in every sector, including oil and gas, can avail themselves of a range of support schemes to transform their businesses and reskill their workforces.&nbsp;These include the Productivity Solutions Grant, which now includes enhanced support for job redesign. Where the trade associations or groups of companies in a sector have expressed strong interest in, or need for, industry- or occupation-specific schemes to facilitate staff redeployment, WSG can work with them to design additional targeted interventions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Likewise, jobseekers that originate from any sector can be considered for participation in a range of career support programmes. Recognising that every jobseeker has transferable skills, programmes focus on matching them to growth opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Today, Workforce Singapore (WSG) offers around 100 career conversion programmes covering in-demand jobs across 30 sectors. We provide substantial support to employers – up to 90% of training and wage costs, when they hire mid-career individuals who do not have the full set of skills required for the job, but are willing to learn and re-skill. The funding recognises the companies’ efforts in staff development. The Jobs Growth Incentive, which was introduced last year and extended at Budget 2021, provides further encouragement to employers during this time of greater uncertainty in the labour market.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">These career conversion programmes have helped many locals to switch into new careers. Since 2016, we have facilitated over 34,000 placements and redeployments through WSG’s career conversion programmes, including locals previously in the oil and gas sector. In the 5th edition of the Jobs Situation Report released last September, we highlighted one such example – 47-year old Mohd Nasir Ja’apar was retrenched in April 2020 from his role as a Senior Quality Engineer in an oil and gas company. Through the Professional Conversion Programme for Advanced Manufacturing Engineer, he joined a Precision Engineering firm and learnt new skills in additive manufacturing and inspection of 3D printer parts. With the right mindset and resolve, other jobseekers, too, can build on transferrable skills and experiences, and make the switch into new careers.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Member has also asked about higher education programmes to prepare our students for emerging jobs relating to sustainability. Our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) continually work closely with industry to ensure that their programme offerings are relevant to industry so that graduates have good employment outcomes. In this way, the IHLs have been strengthening their emphasis on sustainability in their programme offerings. For example, National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) offer sustainability and environment-focused degrees in Environmental Studies, Environmental Engineering, and Environmental Earth Systems Sciences. Temasek Polytechnic offers the Diploma in Architectural Technology &amp; Building Services while Republic Polytechnic will be launching two new diploma courses (Diploma in Sustainable Built Environment and Diploma in Environmental and Marine Science).</p>",

            "content": "<p>24 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Manpower with regard to workplace accidents (a) what more can be done other than issuance of stop-work orders, fines and notices of non-compliance; (b) whether the current deterrence framework is sufficient; and (c) how can employers be proactive and take greater responsibility to ensure workplace safety.</p><p>25 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Manpower (a) to date, how many companies have breached safe distancing measures in workplaces in 2021; (b) what are the punitive actions taken; and (c) how can the Government better support SMEs in putting in place safe distancing measures especially where resources may be more limited. <p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;\tOur main strategy to prevent accidents is to align business interests closely with workplace safety and health (WSH). This was part of our WSH 2028 recommendations. We want employers to realise that it is in their commercial interest to be safer, so that they will be more proactive and take greater ownership of WSH.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t&nbsp;We have been progressively implementing the WSH 2028 recommendations on this front, including making business owners and managements more accountable and prosecuted them for negligence, and sharing work injury compensation claims data with insurers so that premiums reflect safety performance.&nbsp;More recently, with the launch of the CheckSafe e-service on 21 January 2021, developers, main contractors and other service buyers for construction contractors can now use CheckSafe to compare the WSH performances of contractors, which includes injury and enforcement data. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;We plan to expand CheckSafe to cover more sectors in the near future. This gives a commercial advantage to safer firms in securing contracts. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;While we encourage management and business owners to take ownership and be proactive about WSH, deterrence is still necessary to emphasise the serious consequences of workplace accidents. The penalty framework was recently revised to impose higher fines and longer imprisonment terms. The highest fine imposed on a single employer by the Courts increased from $250,000 in 2016 to $400,000 in 2019. Where there was negligence in supervising safety, the Courts have started imposing imprisonment sentences from 2018. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 32, 96);\">&nbsp;</span>Apart from issuing stop-work orders, fines and notices of non-compliance, MOM places companies with poor workplace safety and health records on the Business Under Surveillance (BUS) Programme. This involves close monitoring with more frequent inspections, until MOM is convinced that their WSH management system has improved.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;Construction companies will also be debarred from employing or renewing work passes under MOM’s demerit point framework, if they have multiple WSH infringements. The combination of penalties has helped reduce our fatal injury rate steadily from 2.3 per 100,000 workers in 2013 to 1.0 in 2019, even if we disregard the lower fatality rate in 2020 due to work stoppages. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;WSH also means guarding against health risks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, MOM has been strictly enforcing against non-compliance with Safe Management Measures (SMM) at the workplace. As of 15 March 2021, MOM has conducted close to 17,000 inspections and offered 178 composition notices totalling $178,000 for non-compliance with SMM requirements. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;The common non-compliances were failure to enable employees to work from home, failure to demarcate safe physical distance of at least 1 metre at the pantry, canteen, office desk, meeting rooms, and failure to prepare an evacuation plan for unwell or suspected cases. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;The SMMs are designed to be practical and easy-to-implement, so that all firms including SMEs are able to act on them. To better support SMEs in adapting to the new SMMs effective from 5 April, our SMM advisory includes a step-by-step checklist on how to comply. It also includes guides on business continuity planning, digital solutions and grants that companies can tap on. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;In our inspections, most SMEs have been compliant with the previous SMMs. The latest SMM revisions are a relaxation of previous measures and employers, including SMEs, should find them easier to comply.</p>",

For Singaporeans who need more guidance, the authorised booking partners provide booking assistance at more than 60 locations across Singapore.&nbsp;A digital scheme also allows merchants to manage their capacity to be in line with safe management measures and minimises fraud. Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has been monitoring the usage of SRV closely. There have not been any cases of fraud or profiteering detected thus far.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to feedback, STB and the authorised booking partners have improved the user experience, such as placing additional reminders on child discounts and booking of timeslots. We will continue to review and enhance the process where necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>STB, together with the onboarded merchants and authorised booking partners, will intensify efforts in the next few months to encourage usage of the SRVs. This includes sharing products and promotions across attractions, tours, and hotels, through STB and authorised booking partner channels.

However, project timelines have been affected due to the Circuit Breaker period, strict safe management measures put in place for work at construction sites to resume, and global supply chain disruptions and manpower shortages within the construction industry.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">About 85% of these ongoing BTO projects have been delayed by about six to nine months beyond the Estimated Completion Dates (ECDs) originally indicated to buyers during project launches. The extent of the delay varies by BTO project, and depends on site-specific factors such as manpower availability, the contractor’s performance and materials supply.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">HDB is closely monitoring the construction progress of all BTO projects and will work with contractors to meet the revised completion dates.

This board, which comprises external emergency medicine specialists from the public health sector, helps ensure that our emergency medical response system remains responsive and robust.</p><p>The system consists of multiple layers of response and support to deal with medical emergencies.&nbsp;Firstly, to enable immediate action by their peers on site, all recruits since 2010 have been trained to recognise sign of distress and to perform Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and operate the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) where needed. Ambulances can also be activated via a 24/7 dedicated hotline.</p><p>Secondly, trained medical personnel are required to be present during all SAF exercises and some selected activities even deemed as low risk to provide coverage. During such covers, the medic will be equipped with his medic bag, AED, oxygen tank, and purpose built cooling pads. If medical teams are required for higher risk activities, they will be equipped additionally to perform on-site resuscitation care for a wide range of medical and surgical emergencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such activities, ambulances are also required to be on site.</p><p>Ambulances are manned by dedicated teams comprising a paramedic and medic, and will evacuate persons experiencing medical emergencies to a restructured hospital’s emergency department or the nearest SAF medical centre, as they deem appropriate. All SAF medical centres are manned by medical officers and medics with equipment to deal with resuscitation, Advanced Cardiac Life Support and Emergency Airway Management.</p><p>Similar to medical emergencies, health screening guidelines are also set up and regularly reviewed by another Specialist Advisory Board which comprises senior cardiologists from the public health sector.</p><p>The Board takes into account the latest medical evidence and clinical best practices to recommend health screening guidelines which currently require regulars and IPPT-eligible NSmen aged 35 years and above to undergo Health Screening Programme (HSP) annually. The HSP includes blood and urine tests and a medical examination by a medical officer and further referrals to a specialist for investigation and treatment, if required.

They champion the culture of contributing to our society by individuals, private and public organisations.</p><p>From financial years 2015 to 2019, the CDCs raised an average of almost $12 million<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;every year with the help of corporates, individuals and partners. All these donations go towards funding community programmes and local assistance initiatives that we develop with our network of partners and is not limited to the SSAs.&nbsp;Members can check out the CDC websites for their various programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It would be incorrect to reduce the role of CDCs to that of a fundraiser, transferring donations raised by CDCs to our partners or SSA.&nbsp;The CDCs work closely with many partners to identify emerging needs in the community and support them with the necessary resources to execute programmes and schemes.&nbsp;Besides customising assistance schemes to support the less able, the CDCs co-create and co-develop with various partners on community programmes revolving around building social capital and social resilience. For examples, programmes related to providing employment and employability, giving care to vulnerable residents and caregivers, promoting health and wellness, and protecting the environment.</p><p>These initiatives require more than just money.&nbsp;More importantly, we need volunteers who are willing to contribute their time and talent in the area of leadership and expertise into helping the community.</p><p>Each year, the CDCs mobilise about 11,000 active corporate and community volunteers who each serve no less than 16 hours. Together, we have been able to help over 780,000 beneficiaries in response to COVID-19 last year. Beyond volunteering in community programmes, our volunteers also help us identify emerging needs in the community and work with our partners to design and execute their own projects to help residents.&nbsp;This is the sort of active citizenry that exemplifies our commitment to creating a democracy of deeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our social service and community causes ecosystems must remain nimble while achieving economies of scale.&nbsp;Nationwide policies are by design broad based, which may not be as targeted and localised enough for certain needs.&nbsp;On the other hand, local efforts are much more targeted but find it harder to achieve economies of scale, and to mobilise resources.</p><p>The CDCs play a unique role in the Singapore’s ecosystem of building a cohesive society; mobilising volunteers and resources for diverse causes at the regional level.&nbsp;It seeks to balance customisation for local needs in a targeted way while achieving economies of scale.&nbsp;It gives us flexibility in using a wider range of models beyond the binary options of the national and local schemes.</p><p>When we measure the impact of CDCs, we must go beyond the figures and numbers of resources as inputs or beneficiaries as outputs.&nbsp;More importantly, it is about the outcomes: how cohesive our society is, the people we’ve brought together, the beneficiaries’ lives we have touched, and the leaders we have nurtured.&nbsp;Ultimately, it is also about the spirit of being Singaporean, where we seek to pay forward what we have benefited from the past.&nbsp;We must look at all these indicators holistically when assessing the effectiveness of CDCs.&nbsp;</p><p>I must take this opportunity to thank all the contributions of our District Councillors, partners and volunteers; it is with their continued passion, hard work and leadership that CDCs are able to sustain the partnership and programmes to help the vulnerable amongst us and impact the larger community.</p>",

For victims who stay in our crisis shelters, social service professionals work with the victims to address their safety, financial and emotional concerns, and assist them in securing longer-term and stable housing arrangements.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;Even though shelters are available for victims of family violence (FV), it is often better for victims to be supported in their usual places of residence by their usual support networks of family and friends with minimise disruption to their daily routine, wherever possible. They can and will still be assisted by Family Violence Specialist Centres and Family Service Centres as needed, to ensure that safety plans are in place and they continue to receive the necessary social support.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">To reduce the recurrence of harm, under the Women’s Charter, the Court may make a Domestic Exclusion Order (DEO) when granting a Personal Protection Order. The DEO aims to restrict the perpetrators from entering the shared residence, or parts of the shared residence. Some perpetrators also choose to leave the residence to temporarily stay with other family members or friends. This allows them the space and time to seek help to manage their emotions and tendencies, with the motivation of keeping their loved ones safe and their family intact. MSF and our social service partners can also provide the necessary support to help manage their emotions and tendencies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;For FV victims who apply for public rental flats as their longer-term accommodation, HDB takes into account their circumstances as part of the assessment process, and may exercise flexibility to allocate rental flats to those who have no other housing options.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Beyond providing shelter for victims, the Government has been working closely with our community partners to tackle FV through various means. The National Family Violence Networking System was established in 1996 to connect the Police, Courts, hospitals, social service agencies, and MSF in a tight network to provide support to families facing FV. The Taskforce on Family Violence, which I co-chair with MOS Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, has also done a recent stock-take of the landscape and possible causes of FV, so that we can intervene more effectively. The Taskforce is looking into various recommendations, along four broad thrusts:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">(a)&nbsp; &nbsp;Increasing awareness and strengthening societal attitudes against violence;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">(b)&nbsp; &nbsp;Making it easier for victims and the community to report violence, and to get immediate help;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">(c)&nbsp; &nbsp;Strengthening protection for victims to reduce their risk of being harmed again; and</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">(d)&nbsp; &nbsp;Increasing the accountability of perpetrators and strengthening their rehabilitation.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Taskforce will provide further details after it submits its report to the Minister for Social and Family Development and the Minister for Home Affairs later this year.</p>",

            "content": "<p>44 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister (a) how large is the crypto asset market in Singapore; (b) how does MAS view the trend of greater transactions of such assets amongst companies and retail investors; and (c) how are crypto asset exchanges regulated to provide a stable and benign trading environment in Singapore.</p><p><strong>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: black;\">Mr Speaker, Mr Murali Pillai has also filed a similar PQ for the next Sitting</span><sup>1</sup><span style=\"color: black;\">. My response today will cover the questions raised by both Mr Desmond Choo and Mr Murali Pillai. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">There are two common types of crypto assets. First, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which may be used for payment purposes. Second, securities tokens, which are digital representations of traditional securities such as shares and bonds. The risks posed by each type are different and so are our regulatory approaches. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, as their value is typically not related to any economic fundamentals. They are hence highly risky as investment products, and certainly not suitable for retail investors. MAS has issued numerous consumer advisories to warn the public of the risks of trading these products. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The size of the cryptocurrency market in Singapore remains small compared to, say, shares and bonds. The combined peak daily trading volumes of three major SGD-quoted cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP</span><sup>2</sup><span style=\"color: black;\">&nbsp;– was 2% of the average daily trading volume of securities on SGX in 2020. Cryptocurrency derivatives traded through financial institutions likewise amounted to less than 1% of the derivatives trading activity on SGX. Cryptocurrencies comprise less than 0.01% of the assets in funds managed by MAS-regulated fund managers. Cryptocurrency funds are also not authorised for sale to retail investors.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Exchanges offering the trading of cryptocurrencies are regulated as digital payment token service providers under the Payment Services Act. Given their limited scale, these entities are regulated primarily for money laundering and terrorism financing risks. However, the Act provides MAS the powers to to impose additional measures on digital payment token service providers as needed. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">As for securities tokens, they are subject to the same securities laws as traditional securities. Hence, an exchange that enables trading in securities tokens is regulated under the Securities and Futures Act and subject to the same rules, especially on fair, orderly and transparent trading, as any securities exchange. The size of the securities tokens market today is also small. Of more than 60 Recognised Market Operators currently regulated by MAS under the SFA, only three offer the trading of securities tokens, and with very small trading volumes. Recognised Market Operators are also not allowed to offer their products to retail investors. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">To address the money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) risks associated with cryptocurrencies, MAS has taken steps on three fronts. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">First, digital payment token service providers, which are entities involved in providing cryptocurrency-related services, need to be licensed by MAS.&nbsp;They must comply with AML/CFT requirements, such as obligations to perform customer due diligence and transaction monitoring. They are also required to file suspicious transactions reports with the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD).&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Second, MAS has stepped up surveillance of the cryptocurrency sector, to identify suspicious networks and higher risk activities&nbsp;for further supervisory scrutiny. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Third, MAS and the CAD will continue to raise public awareness on the risks of investing in digital payment tokens, through our advisories and public education efforts. These advisories provide consumers with information on how to avoid being cheated or inadvertently used as mules to carry out money laundering activities. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The crypto assets space is constantly evolving. MAS has been closely monitoring developments and will continue to adapt its rules as needed to ensure that regulation remains effective and commensurate with the risks posed. Investors, on their part, should exercise extreme caution when trading cryptocurrencies. </span></p>",

These donations are largely collected through donation boxes at the mosques.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">COVID-19 has affected the amount of donations that the mosques receive. During the Circuit Breaker last year, the community was unable to make physical donations due to the temporary closure of our mosques. This resulted in a drop in the donations received through the donation boxes.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;To address this issue, MUIS and the mosques turned to digital means to collect donations.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">(a)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our mosques stepped up efforts to facilitate donations through various online payment platforms.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">(b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MUIS and MuslimSG also launched OurMasjid.SG portal in April 2020, which raised about $4.4 million for mosques.</p><p>&nbsp;Since then, mosques have gradually resumed congregational prayers and other religious activities, in line with the prevailing Safe Management Measures. This has led to an increase in physical donations, though not to previous levels.</p><p>&nbsp;MUIS has provided additional funding to support mosques’ operations. This comes in the form of grants to offset the necessary expenses to ensure the safe resumption of religious activities. These expenses include the purchase of equipment for temperature screening, safe entry check-ins, as well as masks and other personal protective gear.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;Like other employers, mosques also receive wage support through the Jobs Support Scheme (or JSS), which totalled about $9.9 million in 2020.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The support from MUIS and the Government, together with the increase in online donations, have helped to cushion the reduction in income and donations during the pandemic. MUIS will continue to work closely with the mosques to ensure they remain financially stable and receive the necessary assistance during these challenging times. I thank the community for their support and encourage them to continue donating online, so that our mosques can serve the congregants in a safe manner.</p>",

The IHLs each ensure an ecosystem of mental health support for students, which aim to both equip students with basic knowledge of mental well-being through programmes on mental wellness literacy and awareness, and establishing support structures to meet students’ mental health needs.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;As a first line of support, academic staff are trained to identify signs of distress in their students, monitor their well-being, and provide guidance and support. All IHLs also have peer support programmes where selected students are trained to look out for and provide support to their peers.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;For students who need additional help, they can tap on the team of counsellors in each IHL, for socio-emotional and counselling support. Each polytechnic and ITE college has four to seven counsellors. The Autonomous Universities, including the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and National University of Singapore (NUS), are similarly equipped with counsellors according to their size and student profile. The IHLs regularly review their counselling provisions, taking into consideration the demand for counselling support. The counsellors are further complemented by a pool of para-counsellors who are academic or non-academic staff with advanced training in counselling.&nbsp;In addition to campus-based provisions, IHL students may choose to tap on alternative avenues of support and resources, such as Social Service Agencies in the community.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;Finally, for students who require further professional assessment and intervention, the IHL counsellors will refer them to mental health professionals, either in the community, such as the Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT), or the public healthcare system, to render additional support.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;MOE works closely with other government agencies to ensure a system of comprehensive support for IHL students, on- and off-campus. It would not be meaningful to compare the on-campus resourcing for mental health with that for the general population, as they are intended to be complementary.</p>",

But its primary objective is to control congestion by limiting the growth of the vehicle population. For regulating vehicles’ emission levels, there are other policy levers.</p><p>Given this, the COE system is designed with equity as a key principle. This means striking a balance between the needs of existing and prospective owners. If we allow repeated five-year COE renewals for these vehicles, there will be fewer COEs recycled for bidding, hence benefitting existing owners at the expense of prospective ones. Therefore, we allow only a single five-year renewal, provided that at the end of it, the vehicle is de-registered.&nbsp;</p><p>This measure was introduced on an exceptional basis for vehicles largely for personal use, i.e. cars and motorcycles, typically in Categories A, B and D. This is because there were owners who felt that at the point of expiry of their COEs, their vehicles may not last another full 10 years.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The considerations for goods vehicles and buses, which use a Category C COE, are different. These vehicles are typically used by businesses and have a statutory lifespan of 20 years.

Instead of legislation alone, we also rely on tripartite guidelines, standards and advisories to shape progressive workplace cultures. Where undesirable practices emerge, we will assess their extent and severity, and seek tripartite consensus on appropriate interventions.

In 2019, TAFEP expanded its efforts by setting up a Workplace Harassment Resource and Recourse Centre. The Centre provides support and recourse for employees who have encountered workplace harassment.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;TAFEP also investigates all complaints of workplace harassment.&nbsp;Employers are advised that TAFEP will report to MOM egregious offenders who fail to provide a safe environment or refuse to improve their grievance handling process, which will trigger a review of the firm’s work pass privileges. Thus far, all employers engaged by TAFEP on workplace harassment matters have been cooperative and receptive. Their follow-up actions include rectifying lapses, taking preventive measures and bringing their practices in line with the Advisory. As such, there has been no need for TAFEP to escalate actions to MOM.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;There are also civil remedies for harassment behaviour that constitutes offences under the Penal Code and the Protection from Harassment Act. While such cases are rare, TAFEP would advise and refer affected employees to seek redress through the Police or the Courts. To date, TAFEP has advised 8 employees to lodge their cases with the Police.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;While we have seen greater awareness and progress in terms of preventive actions, MOM and the tripartite partners will continue to monitor developments and assess if further measures are needed.</p>",

NParks adopts a holistic and science-based approach to mitigating pest bird issues, comprising measures such as food source reduction, habitat modification, and population control.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">To inform its pest bird management strategies, NParks carries out population studies and surveys to understand the ecology of the birds. For example, a recent study by NParks affirmed that food made available by humans is a key driver of pest bird population growth. There are also ongoing studies to examine how their reproductive biology and factors such as food availability, cleanliness, and building design affect their population.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">To reduce the availability of food sources, NParks has been working closely with SFA, NEA, and Town Councils to encourage proper food waste management at food establishments. As part of its education and outreach efforts, NParks also partners Town Councils, MSO, PA, and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to engage feeders. This enables NParks to find out their motivations, address misconceptions, and discourage them from continuing to feed birds. In January 2021, NParks also <span style=\"color: black;\">launched the island-wide \"Say No to Feeding Wildlife\" campaign to raise awareness on the negative impact of feeding wildlife, including birds</span>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In tandem with public education and outreach, NParks works closely with agencies and Town Councils to enforce against illegal bird-feeding. This includes measures such as camera surveillance at identified feeding hotspots, and carrying out targeted enforcement operations. Under the Wildlife Act, which came into force on 1 June 2020, NParks has also strengthened its regulatory regime by imposing stiffer penalties for the illegal feeding of wildlife. Offenders can be fined up to $5,000 for the feeding of any wild animal, including pest bird species, up from $500 for feeding pigeons before the Wildlife Act came into force.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We would like to remind the public to be socially responsible, by not feeding pest birds, and by keeping public areas clean and free of food waste. This is the most promising approach for keeping the pest bird population under control.&nbsp;</p>",

As at end-February, there were nearly 93,000 placements into jobs and skills opportunities. Of this, about 12,000 placements involved short-term jobs related to the fight against COVID-19, such as swabbing or quarantine operations, implementing safe management measures, and providing patient services.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Among those placed into short-term COVID-19 job roles, more than one in four are persons temporarily redeployed as part of the National Jobs Council’s effort to support workers in hard-hit sectors. For example, flight attendants from Singapore Airlines have been deployed as care ambassadors in hospitals, where they provide administrative support, assist and engage patients, and check on their well-being. These workers remain employees of their parent companies, in sectors such as aviation and hospitality where demand remains low. We expect that they will return to their parent companies subsequently when demand recovers, and their skills and experience are again needed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">For the other workers in temporary positions, we are committed to helping them find permanent jobs after they complete their stints.&nbsp;To shore up local hiring demand, we have recently extended and enhanced the Jobs Growth Incentive. Our career conversion programmes provide substantial support to help jobseekers who are prepared to reskill for new careers. This year, we have catered capacity for 10,000 places in our career conversion programmes. WSG will also introduce new programmes for in-demand jobs in growing sectors such as Manufacturing, Information Communications &amp; Technology and Professional Services.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Those who require assistance with their job search can approach WSG and NTUC’s Employment and Employability Institute, including through the 24 SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centres across the country. The Ministry of Manpower and WSG have also appointed Adecco Personnel Pte Ltd, an employment agency with over 64 years of global experience in employment facilitation, as a SGUnited Jobs and Skills Placement Partner. This provides another placement support channel for mature or long-term unemployed jobseekers, and persons with disabilities.</p>",

The Screen for Life (SFL) programme provides subsidies for chronic disease and cancer screening at CHAS GP clinics. These include screening for conditions like obesity, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer. The SFL subsidies were enhanced in September 2017. Under the SFL programme, Singaporeans will pay not more than $5 for the screening tests, screening visit consultation and first follow-up consultation if required.</p><p>Between September 2017 and December 2020, over 100,000 individuals have benefitted from the enhanced SFL subsidies. Of these, about 86% were Chinese, 7% were Malays, and 4% were Indians. About half are eligible for CHAS Blue and Orange, who would have access to the lower SFL co-payment of $2. Of those screened for cardiovascular risk, around 40% had abnormal screening results and their follow-up rates have improved from 56% in 2016 to over 85% in 2020 since the enhancement of the subsidies in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>We recognise that cultural preferences may influence health behaviours, and we have designed tailored, culturally relevant programmes with our community partners to deepen engagement with the various ethnic minority groups. For example, discussions on the importance of health screening and medication adherence have been held at places of worship to assist the Indian community address misconceptions that could prevent them from coming forward for health screening. MOH and HPB have formed a new workgroup to first focus on the Malay-Muslim community, before expanding our efforts to other ethnic minority groups, to design culturally relevant programmes and help rally the Malay-Muslim community against poor health habits. This will entail the co-creation and implementation of year-round healthy living activities in the Malay community with the overall aim to help improve the health and well-being.</p><p>HPB also works with likeminded partners and key stakeholders such as the Singapore Cancer Society, Breast Cancer Foundation and Regional Health Systems to improve awareness of screening and increase screening uptake for cancers especially during the cancer awareness months. This is done by organising specific campaigns and activities to educate the public on the importance of regular health screening and follow-up. We welcome suggestions from the public on how to further improve the health aspect including screening uptake amongst Singaporeans.</p>",

HFCs are commonly used as refrigerants in refrigeration and air-conditioning (RAC) equipment. When emitted into the environment, some HFCs trap a much larger amount of heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore is committed to taking action to control and reduce the use of HFCs with high global warming potential (GWP), as this is in line with our Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy. Since 1 January 2019, HFCs imported into Singapore have been subjected to licensing controls. In 2020, the Climate-friendly Label was introduced to help consumers choose household refrigerators and air-conditioners that use climate-friendly refrigerants. The Grant for Low-GWP Refrigerant Chillers was also introduced to support companies that want to make an early switch to more climate-friendly commercial water-cooled chillers. As HFCs can leak into the atmosphere if RAC equipment is not handled properly, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has launched a training course to train and certify technicians to handle refrigerants properly. Later this year, NEA will mandate the proper recovery, reclamation and destruction of spent refrigerants.</p><p>My Ministry has initiated a review of Singapore’s ratification of the Kigali Amendment.

Agencies such as MOE and MSF work closely with the Police to screen prospective employees who are applying for jobs working with children, such as those in licensed preschools and schools.</p><p>However, as these records are non-public, members of the public, including parents, do not have access to them.</p><p>We are considering whether more steps need to be taken, to make it mandatory that all persons employed in similar sectors working with children be screened. There are some practical difficulties in taking this approach, which we are thinking through.</p><p>It is a further step, from that, to allow parents to screen potential tutors for the tutors’ past offences. I can see the reasonableness in the MP’s request. However, it will be little short of having a public registry of a person’s criminal antecedents. The information could easily become public. And that has its own consequences.</p><p>As far as we know, only the U.S. has a public sex offender registry.

It now has a dedicated team of more than 40 staff for the administration of these programmes, of which about one-third support claims processing. SBF will continue to ramp up hiring as necessary. In addition, SBF launched a new claims portal in January this year, which makes it easier for host organisations to submit and track their claims. For pending claims submitted with complete documentation in March 2021 or earlier, SBF is working towards disbursing the payouts before the end of April 2021.</p><p>&nbsp;SBF has acknowledged the concerns of host organisations that have paid out the allowances to trainees but have yet to receive reimbursement.&nbsp;Going forward, it aims to process claims and disburse the payouts within four weeks if all supporting documentation is in order.&nbsp;</p>",

In 2008, we increased Childcare Leave from two to six days per year for parents with children aged below seven years of age. In 2013, we introduced two days of Extended Childcare Leave per year for parents with children aged 7 to 12. Parents continue to receive their pay when they take childcare leave, with the Government reimbursing employers for three out of six days of Childcare Leave<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;and all of the Extended Childcare Leave.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Many factors affect the employability of working parents, and it would be challenging to isolate childcare leave as the only variable. It is especially challenging to prospectively assess the impact of future childcare leave enhancements on the employability of parents. Nonetheless, feedback we have received through consultations with the tripartite partners suggests that we need to be cautious about the potential impact of enhancing leave schemes. Employers have expressed concerns that more mandatory leave provisions will affect business costs and operations, and reduce the employability of those workers who are more likely to use these leave provisions. Therefore, we must carefully examine the impact on parents and employers, when considering whether to enhance legislated parental leave schemes.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Beyond legislation, it is important for employers to provide a work environment that helps all employees to manage their work and family responsibilities. In the past year, 93% of employers have provided some form of flexible work arrangement (FWA). Working from home during the pandemic has helped workers meet both their work and family needs, and enabled more employers to recognise that FWAs are workable. During public consultations by the Ministry of Health on support for caregivers of seniors, caregivers have also indicated that FWAs were more sustainable than leave provisions in helping them meet their work and caregiving commitments.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Government, together with unions and employers, introduced a Tripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements in 2017, and a Tripartite Standard on Unpaid Leave for Unexpected Care Needs in 2018, to establish good practices that all employers should implement to support their employees’ personal or caregiving responsibilities. As employers and employees become more accustomed to FWAs, the tripartite partners will look into ways to further entrench FWAs in our workplaces, to better support all employees, including working parents with caregiving responsibilities.</p>",

From our engagements, the key stressors they face are in seeking employment and in transiting into work, including coping with new job demands. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">\t&nbsp;The National Youth Council (NYC) has launched Youthopia in October 2020, a digital destination for youth to keep up with trends and connect with fellow youth on issues that matter to them. Youths can access GradGoWhere, a toolkit with career-related resources in the areas of career guidance, readiness, opportunities and upskilling; as well as the Mental Well-being toolkit which includes a myriad of mental health assessment tools and support helplines. We encourage younger workers to visit Youthopia to find relevant career and mental health resources for themselves to support their transition into work.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;Another initiative is the Youth Mental Well-being (YMWB) Network supported by MSF, MOH and MOE. It was set up in February 2020 to generate ideas and implement ground-up projects to support youth mental well-being, such as strengthening peer support in workplaces. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;Beyond supporting younger workers specifically, MOM has introduced initiatives to support the mental well-being of all workers, regardless of age. MOM encourages employers to sign up for iWorkHealth, an online workplace psychosocial health assessment tool to find out their employees’ overall state of mental well-being and the stress factors at work. The company report provides a breakdown of the mental well-being scores by age group, as long as there are at least 8 responses in that age category. This will enable employers to better understand the mental well-being of younger workers.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;The Tripartite Advisory (TA) on Mental Well-being for Workplaces, launched last year, recommends what employers can do to support their employees’ mental well-being. For instance, employers can gain access to free mental well-being talks under the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council’s Total WSH Programme and tap on Health Promotion Board’s Workplace Outreach Wellness (WOW) Package which promotes workplace health programmes, including mental health workshops based on companies’ readiness and their employees’ needs. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">While these initiatives are in place to support workers’ mental well-being in the workplace, they can only complement individuals’ own efforts to take care of their mental well-being, stay active, connected with friends and family, and seek help when required.</p>",

            "content": "<p>78 <strong>Ms Hazel Poa</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for National Development (a) how many wheelchair-bound HDB residents currently live on floors without lift access; and (b) in the last three years, how many cases of complaints have been received annually&nbsp;from wheelchair-bound HDB residents over accessibility problems within HDB blocks and estates.</p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: black;\">With an ageing society and a ever-growing number of senior citizens, more and more HDB residents may face mobility issues and even require the use of wheelchairs. We recognise the increasing need for barrier free accessibility in our HDB estates, which is why we have over the years set out a range of programmes, in full anticipation that all residents may one day have mobility needs. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">In 1990, the Code on Barrier Free Accessibility in Buildings was introduced to set minimum standards for barrier-free accessibility in and outside buildings. This was complemented by BCA’s barrier-free accessibility programme in 2006 to address older buildings built before the Code. In 2012, when the programme was completed, close to 8,000 HDB blocks were made barrier free by retrofitting them with features such as ramps and railings, and by leveling of steps. All new HDB estates are built with barrier-free access features, which include wider corridors for wheelchair movement, and a wheelchair accessible bathroom within the flat. HDB also provides other features such as wheelchair-accessible letter boxes and planters for community planting. Barrier-free accessibility, of course, also applies to connectivity between blocks, key precinct facilities and amenities as well as traffic crossings and transportation nodes.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">In 2001, HDB introduced the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) to provide direct lift access to flats and enhance convenience for residents, especially the elderly and less mobile. At the start of the LUP, there were more than 5,300 HDB blocks without full direct lift access. Over the years, through the use of innovative technical solutions, HDB has provided LUP for the vast majority of these blocks. Today, there remain about 150 blocks where it is still not possible to implement the LUP due to prohibitive costs or existing technical constraints, such as limited space to build new lift shafts.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">While HDB will continue to explore possible ways to bring direct lift access to these blocks, we recognized that some residents may urgently require direct lift access due to medical or mobility issues. Hence, in March last year, HDB introduced the Lift access Housing Grant (LHG) of up to $30,000, to help those with medical or mobility issues buy a new or resale HDB flat with direct lift access. As at February 2021, HDB has approved 22 applications for the LHG and is evaluating another four applications.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">To further help some of our less mobile residents, HDB also enhanced its Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) programme in December 2018 to include two new improvement items – a portable ramp and a customised ramp – to help residents living in HDB flats with multi-step entrances move in and out of their homes with greater ease. Since December 2018, more than 1,900 ramps have been successfully installed. </span>Where ramp solutions are not feasible, a wheelchair lifter is offered as an option in a pilot programme launched in December 2018. As of end February 2021, a total of 10 wheelchair lifters had been installed. I encourage residents who want to make their flats more senior-friendly, be it for themselves or for the seniors living with them, to apply for EASE directly with HDB, or opting for the EASE improvement items when their flats undergo the Home Improvement Programme (HIP).</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Nothwithstanding, we acknowledge that there is always more we and the Town Councils can do, and we have improvement programmes such the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme to upgrade our estates over time. HDB does not track the number of wheel-chair bound residents in our flats. But I can assure the Member that HDB will attend to every case of a resident requesting help with mobility issues, and do its best to assist such residents. Over the past year, HDB received 27 cases of feedback on wheelchair accessibility within HDB blocks and estates.</p>",

It educates employers on their responsibilities of care towards their MDWs, as well as how to manage their relationships with them. The Settling-in-Programme (SIP) for first-time MDWs in Singapore was also launched in 2012. It educates MDWs on their conditions of employment, how to work safely, relationship and stress management. These programmes help to reduce potential challenges MDW and their employers may face during the employment period.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In addition to the upstream education measures, the Ministry also ensures that MDWs are provided with information on helplines they can call, operated by&nbsp;MOM and non-government organisations (NGOs). We regularly reach out to employers, NGOs representing MDWs, and employment agencies to seek feedback on ground issues. In 2018, for example, employers and Employment Agencies highlighted miscommunications between MDWs and their employers as one of the reasons for early termination of contracts. This led MOM to work with the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) and the Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training (FAST) to provide free dispute resolution services to help employers and MDWs resolve their disputes amicably, thus promoting contract completion.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;As mentioned previously during my Committee of Supply speech on 3 March, MOM is reviewing measures to better support and protect MDWs. This includes the policy on rest days. Similar to the stakeholder consultations conducted in the past, we will also conduct consultations to solicit views on this matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

MOE Kindergartens set the benchmark today, with all 36 MOE Kindergartens offering all three MTLs. The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) has also been working closely with the Anchor Operators (AOPs) to double their provision of Malay and Tamil language education to about 350 centres by 2022.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">But MTL teaching resources are limited, so the offer of different MTLs across centres is still expanding.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Nationally, about 1,800 or over 90% of preschools offer at least one Mother Tongue Language. Of these, about 160 preschools, including all MOE Kindergartens, offer all three MTLs. Another 260 preschools offer two MTLs, and the rest offer one MTL.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">We have at least one preschool centre offering Malay or Tamil language in almost all heartland planning areas. ECDA’s continued efforts with AOPs to have a good geographical spread of centres offering MTL, together with MOE’s planned increase in the number of MOE Kindergartens to about 60 by 2025, will offer parents a range of preschools that offer MTL learning. Parents may use the Preschool Search Portal by ECDA to search for the nearest centre with their MTL of choice.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">To expand MTL teaching resources, ECDA has been working closely with training providers and operators to expand training capacity. Today, we have about 10,500 early childhood educators who meet the required language qualifications and could be engaged to teach Chinese Language, about 2,800 for Malay Language, and about 700 for Tamil Language.&nbsp;But not all may choose to teach MTL.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Certificate in Preschool MTL Teaching (CPMTL) for Malay and Tamil Language was launched in 2019 to enhance in-service early childhood educators’ pedagogical skills in the teaching of MTL.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">As of February 2021, close to 300 in-service educators have completed the CPMTL for Malay and Tamil Language and have been deployed as MTL teachers in the preschools.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The national effort to strengthen the learning of MTL and keep our cultures alive has lasted decades and has been upheld as a cornerstone of our education policy.&nbsp;Thousands of educators have dedicated themselves to this mission and the hard work will continue, as we expand our intervention upstream to pre-school.&nbsp;</p>",

Many rare diseases do not have treatment available and patients have shorter lifespans as a result.&nbsp;For some rare diseases where effective treatments are available, medicines can substantially extend their life expectancies and improve their quality of life.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, the Rare Disease Fund (RDF) was established to support Singapore Citizens suffering from rare genetic diseases where medication is very costly and required for life.&nbsp;The fund is sustained through a combination of society’s contributions and the Government’s 3:1 co-matching of funds raised. Medications can be considered for coverage when there is clear evidence that they are clinically effective.&nbsp;When there are sufficient funds to generate the income needed to fund the pay-outs to the beneficiaries, more medications can be added to RDF’s support list, and more patients can be assisted.&nbsp;</p><p>Singaporeans undergoing treatment at public healthcare institutions can apply for assistance through medical social workers for medicines that are covered by the RDF’s support.&nbsp;Each RDF application is carefully assessed by an independent RDF Committee comprising members with diverse backgrounds from the community sector, private corporations, and healthcare.&nbsp;They consider various factors such as whether the patient is clinically eligible and therefore likely to benefit from the treatment, the family’s ability to afford the treatment either in part or in whole, as well as any extenuating circumstances faced by the patient and family.&nbsp;Beneficiaries are also expected to make a co-payment commensurate with the family’s means.&nbsp;To date, the RDF committee has received applications from eight patients and only one application was not supported as the cost of treatment was assessed to be within the family’s means.&nbsp;</p><p>Groups like the Rare Disorders Society (Singapore) (RDSS) and Rainbow Across Borders (RAB) have been helpful in raising awareness and providing support to patients with rare diseases.&nbsp;The RDSS and the RDF have collaborated in raising awareness about rare diseases as well as in fundraising.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As our population is small, the number of patients with rare diseases is correspondingly lower than most countries.&nbsp;Our public healthcare institutions diagnose or treat most patients with rare diseases and are therefore able to monitor the prevalence, condition, and support provided to the patients.&nbsp;Due to patient confidentiality and the number of patients is small, this information is not published.</p><p>Nevertheless, it continues to be important that public awareness for rare diseases is raised, and the Government will continue to do so through the RDF and with interest groups like the RDSS and RAB.&nbsp;As the RDF can only support patients according to the funds it has available, we encourage Singaporeans to take an interest and contribute generously to supporting those in need.</p>",

They were predominantly younger, having been in their current jobs for less than two years. They were also distributed across many occupations, including nurses, primary school teachers, accountants, graphic designers and part-time polytechnic lecturers.

Most recently in 2019, MOM removed the $4,500 salary threshold for M&amp;Es to be covered for core provisions under the Employment Act (EA), such as holiday and sick leave entitlements. With this, all M&amp;Es are covered for these core provisions.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">MOM will continue to work closely with tripartite partners to ensure that employment laws remain relevant and responsive to labour market conditions and the needs of our workforce.</p>",

Our volunteers serve in various community initiatives such as ComLink and KidSTART, which were established to meet the needs of lower-income families with young children. They are also active in the Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers (PEERS) network, and the Vulnerable-In-Community (VIC) network – which engage and support vulnerable persons such as rough sleepers, tissue sellers and cardboard collectors. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">MSF works with donors to channel their donations through Community Chest, which supports more than 200 programmes run by more than 80 social service agencies. Their contributions are matched to specific funding needs in the social service sector – covering areas such as children with special needs, youth-at-risk, adults with disabilities, lower-income seniors, families-in-need and persons with mental health conditions. Their efforts are vital as we work together to meet the needs of those who need help, and to build a caring society. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"> There are three key steps that MSF takes to match volunteers and donors to the needs in the community. First, we engage our community partners and the clients we serve, to map out and identify specific community needs. Next, we speak with potential volunteers and donors to gauge their interest in working with MSF to address these needs. We will then proceed with the matching once there is alignment between the identified need and the volunteer’s or donor’s areas of interest. &nbsp;As new needs in the community arise, we will continue to engage and encourage potential volunteers and donors to contribute accordingly. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">When MSF comes across volunteers and donors who are interested to contribute in areas beyond MSF’s purview, we will link them up with the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC), or the SG Cares Office.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">MSF is committed to providing meaningful giving experiences for our volunteers and donors. We recognise that many Singaporeans have expressed their desire to be more involved in efforts – in caring for those in need. The Ministry is currently looking at ways to enhance the matching process for our volunteers and donors, and will provide more details once these initiatives are ready. </p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In the meantime, we encourage all who are interested to volunteer in the social service sector to visit MSF’s page at volunteer.sg and NVPC’s giving.sg website. They may also physically approach any SG Cares Volunteer Centre for assistance. Those who would like to donate can also approach the Community Chest for the latest giving opportunities in the social service sector.&nbsp;</p>",

Public education and outreach are key thrusts of NParks’ wildlife management approach.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">A key focus area is to discourage the feeding of wildlife. Intentional feeding or irresponsibly discarding food waste can alter the natural foraging behaviour of wildlife, and lead them to rely on humans for an easy source of food. To raise awareness on the negative impact of feeding wildlife, NParks launched the island-wide “Say No to Feeding Wildlife” campaign in January this year. NParks also works closely with other public agencies, grassroots organisations and Town Councils to engage the community on proper refuse management, and to deter illegal wildlife feeding. NParks also works with these stakeholders to develop educational resources, and on outreach initiatives to advise the community on how to respond to wildlife sightings.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">NParks will continue to step up its efforts to educate the community, including young Singaporeans, on these issues. This includes working with schools, ranging from pre-schools to tertiary institutions, to engage students through assembly talks, school plays, learning journeys and final-year projects, amongst other initiatives. NParks has also developed educational resources such as story books, videos, and exhibition panels to aid educators in teaching students about appropriate human-wildlife interactions. These programmes and resources complement the science curriculum by enabling students to appreciate the diversity and interactions between different flora and fauna, as well as to show care and responsibility towards the environment.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">NParks will continue to take a science-based approach in promoting harmonious human-wildlife co-existence. This includes carrying out population surveys and research studies to better understand the distribution of wildlife in Singapore, so that proper mitigation measures can be taken where needed.&nbsp;NParks, together with other agencies, will continue to put in place measures to safeguard public safety and health.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">All of us need to play our part to live in harmony with wildlife. We can do this by not feeding wildlife, keeping our residential areas clean, and appreciating wildlife from a safe distance.</p>",

The Government has paid out more than $75 million to eligible care recipients and their families as at end-February 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>The HCG, like other MOH schemes, is means-tested to ensure that it is given to households who most need the support.&nbsp;Care recipients in households receiving income will qualify for HCG if their per-capita household income is no more than $2,800.&nbsp;Care recipients in households with no income will qualify for the HCG if they are living in properties with an annual value of no more than $13,000.&nbsp;This annual value criterion of $13,000 covers all HDB flats today.&nbsp;</p><p>MOH continually reviews our schemes to ensure that they meet the needs of our seniors.&nbsp;Families who need further help with caregiving expenses can approach the AIC Links or the Social Service Offices for further assistance.</p>",

            "content": "<p>103 <strong>Miss Cheryl Chan Wei Ling</strong> asked&nbsp;the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) whether the Government will consider setting the example to reduce or eliminate the submission requirement for hard copies in design and construction tender contracts; and (b) whether different departments or agencies from the same Ministry can share soft copies submitted instead of requesting for excessive number of hard copies in each project review.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Mr Heng Swee Keat</strong>:&nbsp;Government tenders are conducted online via the GeBIZ procurement system, which has been accepting electronic submissions since 2003. We have progressively enhanced the bandwidth and file size limit of GeBIZ to allow larger files and drawings to be submitted. Almost all tender proposals, including those for design and construction tenders, are submitted online today. For regulatory clearance, the Government has also required all submissions for construction projects to be done electronically through the Construction and Real Estate Network (CORENET) since 2001. </p><p>As construction projects often involve the review of very large technical drawings, some agencies may request hardcopies to facilitate tender evaluation and onsite discussion. This is done only if necessary when there is no alternative. These requirements are stated upfront so that consultants and contractors can price them into their bids.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Government has been working towards full digitalisation of our workflows and processes. MOF has been conducting service journeys to make procurement more seamless for both agencies and suppliers.

            "content": "<p>4 <strong>Mr Desmond Choo</strong> asked&nbsp;the Prime Minister (a) what is the impact of rapidly rising US long-term interest rates on Singapore; and (b) how will it affect Singaporean households with exposure to property mortgages. </p><p><strong>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (for the Prime Minister)</strong>:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: black;\">Since the start of the year, financial markets have been anticipating a robust US economic recovery, especially in light of the country's large fiscal stimulus package and the ongoing progress in vaccinations. The bond market expects that the strong economic expansion will lead to higher inflation, and has hence pushed up long-term interest rates. Notwithstanding this, long-term rates remain near record lows.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The rise in interest rates in the US should therefore be seen in the context of a strong recovery in the US economy, which will benefit the global economy and add some momentum to our own economic recovery in Singapore<span style=\"color: black;\">. The Singapore economy is projected to experience broad-based growth of 4 to 6% this year, a reversal from the 5.4% contraction in 2020. Employment and income prospects are also projected to improve this year. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">Singapore's domestic interest rates are largely influenced by global market movements and especially by US rates. They can hence be expected to rise going forward. If and when that happens, debt servicing costs for borrowers will also increase. However, most households should continue to be able to service their mortgage loans. This is because all property mortgages taken up since 2013 are subject to MAS' Total Debt Servicing Ratio (\"TDSR\") framework, which limits monthly loan repayments to no more than 60% of the borrower's income based on a 3.5% interest rate</span><sup>1</sup><span style=\"color: black;\">, which is significantly higher than current rates of less than 1.5% for new private property loans</span><sup>2</sup><span style=\"color: black;\">. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">MAS' analysis also shows that the median household’s mortgage servicing ratio would remain manageable even under a stress scenario of a 2.5%-point increase in mortgage interest rates and a 10% fall in income.</span> <span style=\"color: black;\">However, a small segment of households within the private property market could face cash flow strains.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">The risk of rising interest rates is a reminder that everyone should continue to exercise caution in their property purchase decisions. Buyers should assume that interest rates will rise, and be sure of their ability to service their loans before making long-term financial commitments. </span></p>",

            "sectionType": "WA",
            "content": "<p>8 <strong>Mr Yip Hon Weng</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Law (a) in the past three years, how many claims have been made against home renovation firms that failed to deliver after accepting a deposit; (b) under what circumstances will the Ministry intervene should companies refuse to abide by the court's judgment to refund payments and instead choose to wind down the business; and (c) whether company owners or directors who face multiple claims will be barred from registering new companies and have their existing companies listed on a registry for consumers to be wary of.</p><p><strong>Mr K Shanmugam</strong>:&nbsp;Between January 2018 and December 2020, 627 cases pertaining to renovation disputes were filed with the Small Claims Tribunals, while 278 civil writs involving renovation disputes were filed with the State Courts. However, we do not have data to identify how many of these renovation disputes involve claims against home renovation firms that failed to deliver after accepting a deposit.</p><p>Where the Court has issued a judgment requiring a payment or deposit to be refunded, that judgment must be complied with. If not, the claimant can take steps to enforce the judgment.</p><p>If the renovation firm is unable to satisfy the judgment because it is insolvent, the firm may be wound up. The usual insolvency laws will then apply. In such a situation, a consumer who has obtained a court order that requires the payment of monies may file a proof of debt as a creditor of the company. The liquidator will realise the company's assets and make appropriate distributions to the creditors if there are sufficient assets remaining for distribution.</p><p>There are various measures in place to protect consumers from errant contractors that become insolvent. For instance, under the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act, it is an offence for a company to carry on business with the intent to defraud its creditors. It is also an offence for a company to incur a debt or other liability without reasonable prospect of meeting it in full. Directors or officers of a company that engages in fraudulent or wrongful trading can be liable on conviction to a term of imprisonment. These directors or officers can also be held by the Court to be personally liable for all debts or liabilities of the company arising from such fraudulent or wrongful trading.&nbsp;</p><p>Errant contractors who engage in unfair practices may also be dealt with under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.&nbsp;For example, it is an unfair practice for a contractor to accept pre-payment for the supply of goods or services if that contractor knows or ought to reasonably know that it would be unable to supply the goods or services. Contractors that persistently engage in unfair trade practices could be referred to the Competition and Consumer Commission (\"CCCS\") for investigation. Where warranted, the CCCS will seek a court injunction to restrain a contractor (or any other supplier of goods or services) from engaging in an unfair practice.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is not possible for the Government to intervene in cases where a company winds up as a result of genuine financial difficulties. The possibility of a company going under due to financial difficulties is a risk that is inherent in any transaction.&nbsp;It is <em>caveat emptor</em>. Consumers are therefore encouraged to conduct due diligence and proper research, so that they can make informed purchasing decisions. This is especially so if the transaction involves a significant prepayment.</p><p>In this regard, consumers can refer to the consumer advisories and company alert list that the Consumers Association of Singapore (\"CASE\") publishes on its website against firms that have received multiple complaints.&nbsp;</p><p>Home owners who intend to carry out renovation works can also consider engaging renovation contractors that are accredited under the joint accreditation between CASE and Singapore Renovation Contractors (\"CaseTrust-RCMA\"). Such contractors are required to protect a customer's deposit through the purchase of a deposit performance bond, that safeguards the deposit against closure, winding up or liquidation before the renovation is completed.&nbsp;</p><p>For major HDB renovation works, flat owners must also engage a renovation contractor listed in the HDB Directory of Renovation Contractors. A company convicted for offences such as cheating or that appears on CASE's company alert list, cannot be listed in the Directory of Renovation Contractors, and will not be allowed to carry out major renovation works in HDB flats.&nbsp;</p>",

            "content": "<p>10 <strong>Ms Ng Ling Ling</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Health given the rise in number of seniors living only with their spouse, should one or both of their health suddenly deteriorate and they are unable to look after each other or afford a foreign domestic worker, what are the programmes they can tap on both if they are staying in HDB flats or private landed homes.</p><p><strong>Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>:&nbsp;The Ministry of Health works with our partners to put in place various programmes and services to enable seniors with different care needs to age well in the community, regardless of their housing type.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure that seniors remain connected with the community, the Silver Generation Office, eldercare centres, and befriending services regularly reach out to seniors to check on their wellbeing. Seniors can also subscribe to CareLine, a 24/7 telephone service, for personal care support. These outreach channels will help to identify and refer seniors with care needs to appropriate care services.&nbsp;</p><p>These care services include home-based care and centre-based care. For instance, seniors can engage in activities such as exercises, music therapy and handicraft sessions at day care, or attend centre-based rehabilitation sessions. Transport services to and from these centres are also available. Homebound seniors can also receive home-based medical, nursing and personal care services or have meals delivered to them if needed. Seniors with significant mobility difficulties can also access medical escort and transport services to help them with their medical appointments. They may also enrol in the Integrated Home and Day Care programme, which offers a combination of home and centre-based care services. Eligible seniors may receive up to 80% subsidies for these home and centre-based services.&nbsp;</p><p>The Government also has other programmes to support care in the community. For example, the Home Caregiving Grant (HCG) provides a monthly $200 cash grant to eligible individuals with permanent moderate disability to defray the cost of care-giving. Eligible seniors can also apply for the Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund to offset the cost of assistive devices and home healthcare items.&nbsp;</p><p>Seniors who require services or caregiving support may call the Agency for Integrated Care's (AIC) hotline or approach a nearby AIC Link for further assistance.</p>",

Vaccinations for seniors aged 70 years and above and those aged 60 to 69 commenced in February and March respectively. We have also just commenced the vaccination for those aged 45 to 59 years.&nbsp;</p><p>The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination had also recommended to prioritise frontline workers at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection, such as those in the aviation and maritime sectors, as well as those who are of critical importance to the functioning of Singapore.&nbsp;This includes personnel involved in safeguarding our borders and maintaining law and order, and those ensuring that utilities such as water, energy and telecommunications services are not disrupted. Selected workers who ensure the supply of essential food and household items, such as those involved in the frontline operations of handling, processing and managing our importation and distribution of food supplies and stockpiles, have been included within this pool.&nbsp;As is the case for other organisations/sectors providing essential services, only a proportion of workers employed within the food sector will be prioritised to ensure the continuity of essential services, due to the constraints on vaccine supply.</p><p>As more vaccine stocks arrive, we will continue to expand our vaccination programme to more segments of the population, so that all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore will have the chance to be vaccinated by end-2021.</p>",

It is an offence under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Amendment Act (TCASA) 2017 to sell, use, possess for sale, import or distribute imitation tobacco products. This includes ENDS and Heated Tobacco Products (HTPs).</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) works closely with the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to interdict ENDs and HTPs at the checkpoints. ICA staff are trained to identify prohibited tobacco products and there is a joint ICA-HSA standard operating procedure (SOP) on the handling of such smuggling cases. HSA enforcement officers also conduct active surveillance and work closely with online purchasing platforms, including Carousell, Instagram, Lazada and Shopee, to address the illegal sales of ENDS and HTPs. In 2020, more than 2,000 postings were removed.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;Research by the Health Promotion Board (HPB) among youths in 2019 found that more than 70% of respondents were unaware that e-cigarettes contain nicotine, carcinogens and fine particles. Leveraging these insights, HPB developed a public education campaign in 2019 to create awareness and understanding on the health harms of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS). Targeted at youths aged 18 to 25 years old and parents with teenage children, the campaign's objective was to raise awareness of the harmful ingredients found in e-cigarettes, including benzene and formaldehyde which are known carcinogens. Information on the negative effects of vaping is also available on HealthHub.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;HPB also works closely with the Ministry of Education and Institutes of Higher Learning to raise awareness among youths about the benefits of leading a tobacco-free lifestyle and encourage them to stay vape-free. This involves organising online learning activities on the harms of vaping, through gamification methods (e.g. virtual escape rooms) to educate the youths<span style=\"color: rgb(112, 48, 160);\">. </span><span style=\"color: black;\">HPB also provides resources for self-directed learning, and trains educators so that they are equipped to discuss the harms of vaping with their students. </span>HPB's smoking cessation programmes for youth smokers adopt a strengths-based approach to build confidence for behaviour change.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;The Ministry of Health would like to remind the public that the importation, sale, distribution, purchase, use and possession of e-vaporisers and its accessories are prohibited under the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act. We will continue to work with our partner agencies to control access to, as well as educate the public on the negative health effects of these emerging products. Additionally, we will also need the support of the public to remain vigilant and alert authorities, should they be aware of any illicit ENDS-related commercial activities. Members of the public who have information on the illegal import, distribution, sale or offer for sale of prohibited tobacco products can submit an online form at go.gov.sg/reporttobaccooffences. Alternatively, they can contact HSA's Tobacco Regulation Branch at Tel: 6684 2036 or 6684 2037 during office hours.</p>",

The aim is to re-open our borders safely and facilitate travel while minimising the impact on public health. Different countries and regions have different incidence rates of COVID-19 cases, varying testing capacities and policies, and varying measures to control community spread of COVID-19. These factors affect the risk of importation. All travellers and returning Singaporeans are required to take a COVID-19 test upon arrival. Generally, travellers and returning Singaporeans from higher-risk countries and regions are subject to more stringent measures, including a 14-day Stay-Home-Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities, with a COVID-19 test administered on arrival and before their exit from SHN. These measures allow us to minimise the risk of the virus spreading to the community from imported cases.</p><p>Travellers and returning Singaporeans from lower risk countries and regions may have to serve a 7-day SHN at their place of residence with a COVID-19 test administered at the end of their SHN. As these countries have lower incidences of COVID-19 and measures in place to detect and keep community spread at bay, travellers returning from these regions are assessed to have lower risks of spreading COVID-19 to Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>Singapore's border measures are not static and will evolve as the global situation changes. If the situation in a country or region deteriorates, more stringent measures will be put in place to limit the risks of importation and community transmission from imported cases. Similarly, if the situation in a country/region improves, we will consider relaxing our border health measures to facilitate travel. We encourage everyone to check the SafeTravel website (https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg) regularly for the latest updates.</p>",

In 2019, the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th percentile values for the daily post-subsidy bill sizes for Singaporeans staying in Class B2 and C wards were $200, $270, $400, $660 and $1,300 respectively before MediShield Life and MediSave. After MediShield Life claims and MediSave coverage, the patient's out-of-pocket payment would be significantly lower. Please note that a patient's inpatient bill at the PHIs depends not only on the length of stay, but also other components such as procedures undergone, drugs prescribed, and diagnostics tests and implants required.</p><p>MOH's priorities include going \"Beyond Hospital to Community\" to centre care in the community. This includes anchoring care in the primary care setting and enabling individuals to receive long-term care at home or in the community where appropriate. This also helps patients to receive care in an environment which they are familiar with, and allows them to avoid expensive hospital care when it is not required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Services that provide medication administration and phlebotomy at home are currently available to less mobile patients as part of home nursing visits.

For this reason, they are required to purchase insurance coverage of at least $15,000 per year. This covers about 95% of hospital bills incurred by such workers.&nbsp;</p><p>To have further protection against larger medical bills, employers may pay additional premiums for higher insurance coverage. Those who do not would have to bear these additional expenses out-of-pocket. In extenuating circumstances, MOM has stepped in to help and the worker is not denied appropriate treatment despite their employers' inability to meet their obligations. In the last three years, an average of 25 employers and their workers annually were supported, and most of the workers were domestic workers employed by Singaporean households. The average bill size of these workers was $45,000 and the amount supported was about $29,000 per worker.&nbsp;</p><p>As previously shared, MOM is reviewing the medical coverage for migrant workers and will provide an update in due course.&nbsp;</p>",

            "content": "<p>38 <strong>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for Manpower (a) in light of Indonesia's decision to implement a zero placement fee policy, whether the Ministry expects other countries, such as the Philippines and Myanmar, to implement similar moves; (b) whether the Ministry has plans to work with employment agencies to increase the percentage of FDWs from the current approved list of source countries that have a low presence here in Singapore, such as Thailand and Cambodia; and (c) whether there are plans to expand the list of approved source countries for FDWs.</p><p><strong>Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>:&nbsp;Indonesia informed employment agencies (EAs) in Singapore of its intent to implement a \"zero placement fee\" policy in 2020. This meant that the placement fee payable to the EAs in Indonesia would be borne by the employers instead of the Indonesian migrant domestic workers (MDWs). The \"zero placement fee\" policy has not taken effect in Indonesia yet. Indonesia is not the first country to propose a \"zero placement fee\" policy. The Philippines government introduced a similar policy since 2006. While employers of Filipino MDWs typically pay higher EA service fees than those who hire MDWs of other nationalities, there is still a sizeable demand for Filipino MDWs today.</p><p>When the Indonesian \"zero placement fee\" policy kicks in, some EAs here may charge higher service fees to employers hiring Indonesian MDWs. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will ensure that employers have full information of the cost implications before making their hiring decisions. EAs are already required to provide a clear breakdown of the fees charged to the employers.</p><p>We also have in place a good mix of approved source countries for MDWs. Indonesia, Philippines, Myanmar and India are the source countries which are more popular with employers here. Expanding the list of approved source countries is only useful if there is employer demand. For example, employers have been able to bring in MDWs from Cambodia since 2016, but interest has been relatively low.</p><p>In any case, it will be unwise to rely only on dedicated-MDWs to meet our housekeeping and caregiving needs. In this regard, MOM piloted the Household Support Scheme in 2017 and there are now more than 70 companies tapping on the scheme to offer part-time household services, such as home cleaning. Additionally, families caring for the elderly or young children can also tap on eldercare services and, child- and student-care centres.</p>",

Combustible dust takes many forms, including food products such as flour, sugar, and corn starch.

The risk of combustible dust explosions can be minimised with simple measures such as having adequate ventilation and regular housekeeping to prevent the build-up of dust in the air.&nbsp;Companies can refer to the MOM circular on the Hazards and Controls of Combustible Dusts dated 23 July 2015.</p>",

The vast majority of DP holders do not work during their stay in Singapore.

MOM does not collect data on whether DP LOC holders are working full-time or part-time. Their salary information is also indicative at the point of application and generally aligned with those of the foreign workforce here. We do not publish the breakdown of our foreign workforce by nationality, including for DP LOC holders, as it is not in Singapore's best interest to do so.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">From 1 May 2021, MOM will be aligning the requirements for DP holders who wish to work in Singapore with the requirements for all other foreigners working in Singapore. All DP holders who wish to work during their stay in Singapore will need to apply for a relevant work pass, such as an Employment Pass, S Pass or Work Permit. The impact to the overall workforce is likely to be minimal as the majority of existing DP LOC holders will be able to qualify for a mainstream work pass. As for the impact at the firm level, it will depend on LOC employers' willingness to accommodate them through adjustments to their HR arrangements. This change does not affect foreign spouses and children of Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents holding a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) or LTVP-Plus (LTVP+) issued by ICA.

These jobs can be taken up by both fresh graduates from the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), polytechnics, and universities, as well as mid-career applicants. 25% of the new jobs will be for residents taking part in NParks' Resident Gardeners Programme, a pilot programme where landscape companies employ residents to care for greenery in their neighbourhoods. Finally, 5% of the jobs will be in related industries such as information technology and facilities management. These estimates are subject to change based on industry developments and the results of NParks' ongoing pilots for the Resident Gardeners Programme, and the use of digital technologies to manage greenery and parks.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">NParks works with stakeholders in the landscape industry and Institutes of Higher Learning to support the industry's training needs.&nbsp;This is part of NParks' efforts to digitalise, mechanise and professionalise the sector under the Landscape Sector Transformation Plan. For example, NParks has worked with ITE to revise its landscaping course curriculum to impart a wider range of skills, including digital skills. Companies can also tap on ITE’s Work-Study Diploma in Arboriculture and Horticulture. NParks' Centre for Urban Greenery and Ecology also conducts skills training programmes for landscape sector professionals, and NParks will train residents in the pilot Resident Gardeners Programme to use mechanised tools for their work, where relevant.</p>",

This includes ensuring compliance with the Singapore Civil Defence Force's (SCDF) fire safety requirements. Town Councils and MCSTs should hence conduct regular checks and respond promptly to feedback on excessive clutter in common areas. SCDF can issue Fire Hazard Abatement Notices to require Town Councils or MCSTs to rectify any fire hazards identified during its inspections. If the fire safety risk is serious, SCDF can issue a notice of composition to the Town Council or MCST.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Town Councils and MCSTs are respectively empowered under the Town Councils Act and the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act to enact by-laws to regulate the use of common areas. For Town Councils, this includes by-laws that prohibit the excessive placement of objects that may cause obstruction at common areas. MCSTs are also required to adopt a set of prescribed by-laws, including one that prohibits residents from obstructing the use of the common property. The Town Councils and MCSTs work closely with SCDF to regulate and rectify obstructions that may cause a fire hazard. Residents who flout the Town Councils' by-laws are liable for a fine of up to $5,000. MCSTs are also empowered to remove obstructions and recover the costs incurred from residents.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The Government adopts a multi-pronged approach to tackle the issue of clutter in common areas. HDB conducts site inspections on selected blocks to ensure that the HDB estates are well-managed. Reports from these inspections are sent to Town Councils for follow-up. To raise awareness amongst residents on the dangers of obstruction and promote good neighbourliness, HDB organises outreach activities such its Outreach to Young and Youth! and Friends of Heartlands Programme to promote gracious living which includes keeping corridors uncluttered.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">&nbsp;Residents are strongly encouraged to do their part to maintain a safe and pleasant living environment by removing corridor clutter and ensuring that passages are clear.</p>",

            "content": "<p>47 <strong>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim</strong> asked&nbsp;the Minister for National Development whether HDB will (i) consider a waiver from the two-time limit for HDB’s housing loan eligibility (HLE) where individuals have derived no direct monetary benefit from their ownership of the property and (ii) review its advisory protocol for HDB loan officers to fully articulate the consequences of including one's name into HDB flat ownership following the death of a parent so as to preclude instances where names are included \"for safety\" but inadvertently result in the applicant losing one of their two opportunities to obtain a HLE loan.</p><p><strong>Mr Desmond Lee</strong>:&nbsp;HDB provides up to two housing loans at the concessionary interest rate to eligible Singapore citizen households, subject to credit assessment and the prevailing mortgage loan criteria<span style=\"color: black;\">. </span>This<span style=\"color: black;\"> is generally sufficient to meet the needs of most flat buyers. </span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: black;\">As </span>an HDB housing loan is intended to help flat buyers to finance their home purchase, all flat buyers are considered to have taken the housing loan once it is disbursed. This is regardless of <span style=\"color: black;\">whether they subsequently profit from the ownership of the flat. </span>Nevertheless, for those who have already taken two housing loans from HDB, HDB exercises flexibility on a case-by-case basis to provide another HDB housing loan to those who have exhausted their financing options, and are in urgent need of housing.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Individuals who apply for an HDB <span style=\"color: black;\">concessionary </span>loan to include their name as a co-owner in a flat to replace their parent following their parent's demise are advised at various points that they will be considered as having taken one HDB concessionary loan. For instance, the HDB Loan Eligibility letter highlights that all loan applicants will be deemed as having taken an HDB housing loan once the loan is disbursed. This point is similarly included in the Terms and Conditions in the application for a change of flat ownership to include the child as a co-owner. As an added measure, HDB staff also highlight this implication to the applicants on the completion day of the change in flat ownership.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Flat buyers who wish to preserve the option to take up an HDB housing loan in future may consider taking out a mortgage loan from the financial institutions regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore instead, subject to the financial institution's requirements.</p>",
